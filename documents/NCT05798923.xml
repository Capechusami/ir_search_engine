  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, single-arm, open-label, exploratory study assessing the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of LAM-001 as an add-on therapy for the treatment of WHO functional class III subjects&#xD;
      with WSPH Group-1 or Group-3 pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately fifteen participants will receive standard of care plus LAM-001 (inhaled&#xD;
      sirolimus) 100 mcg by oral inhalation once daily for the first 24 weeks of the study (Core&#xD;
      Study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who complete the first 24 weeks on treatment and appear to have a favorable&#xD;
      benefit-risk profile will be eligible to continue receiving LAM-001 (inhaled sirolimus) for&#xD;
      the remainder of the study (Extension Period) up of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete evaluations during a Follow-Up Period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
