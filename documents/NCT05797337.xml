  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this cross-sectional study is to learn about the level of knowledge and attitudes&#xD;
      of medical staff working in dialysis centers about living kidney donations. The main&#xD;
      questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the level of knowledge of dialysis center medical staff regarding living kidney&#xD;
           transplantations?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How much time does the staff have for educating the patients about living kidney&#xD;
           donations? Participants will be asked to answer a self-report questionnaire along with&#xD;
           two standardized tools.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge and attitudes of dialysis centers medical workers toward living kidney donations.</measure>
    <time_frame>22 months</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge and attitudes will be measured using a 38-item self-report questionnaire with single and multi-choice questions.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>How satisfaction with life impacts attitudes toward living kidney donation</measure>
    <time_frame>22 months</time_frame>
    <description>Polish adaptations of a standardized tool will be used to measure satisfaction with life.&#xD;
Satisfaction with Life Scale with responses measured using a 7-point Likert scale, where: 7-I strongly agree, 6-I agree, 5-I tend to agree, 4-I neither agree nor disagree, 3-I tend to disagree, 2-I disagree, 1-I strongly disagree. The result of the measurement was a general indicator of the feeling of satisfaction with life ranging from 5 to 35 points (scores of 20 are considered neutral).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>How self-esteem impacts attitudes toward living kidney donation</measure>
    <time_frame>22 months</time_frame>
    <description>Polish adaptations of standardized tools will be used to measure self-esteem.&#xD;
A 10-item Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) with responses measured on a 4-item Likert scale where: 0 (strongly agree), 1 (agree), 2 (disagree), and 3 (strongly disagree). The maximum score is 30, and higher scores indicate higher self-esteem.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>How empathy impacts attitudes toward living kidney donation</measure>
    <time_frame>22 months</time_frame>
    <description>Polish adaptations of standardized tools will be used to measure empathy.&#xD;
Davis' Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), a 28-item self-report questionnaire using a 5-item Likert scale with two anchors (A=Does not describe me well; E=Describes me very well). The IRI covers multiple dimensions of empathy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>How self-efficacy impacts attitudes toward living kidney donation</measure>
    <time_frame>22 monts</time_frame>
    <description>Polish adaptations of standardized tools will be used to measure self-efficacy.&#xD;
General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) with the total score calculated by finding the sum of all the items and ranges between 10 and 40, with a higher score indicating more self-efficacy.</description>
