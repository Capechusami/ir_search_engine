    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to develop and verify the auxiliary role of the artificial&#xD;
      intelligence system in pancreatic ultrasound endoscopic scanning.The main questions it aims&#xD;
      to answer are as follows: 1.The comparison of the image recognition accuracy between the&#xD;
      artificial intelligence system and the ultrasound endoscopist; 2. Whether the artificial&#xD;
      intelligence system can improve the efficiency of the pancreatic scanning for the ultrasound&#xD;
      endoscopist. Participants will undergo pancreatic EUS with or without the assistance of the&#xD;
      artificial intelligence system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a total of 200 cases of pancreatic endoscopic ultrasound scanning videos and&#xD;
      images will be collected. First of all, an artificial intelligence system based on deep&#xD;
      learning for the navigation and quality control of pancreatic endoscopic ultrasonography will&#xD;
      be established. Secondly, the artificial intelligence system will be used to identify the&#xD;
      site and anatomical structure of the pancreatic ultrasound endoscopy, and the results of the&#xD;
      artificial intelligence system's station recognition will be compared with the results of the&#xD;
      endoscopist's station recognition. Finally, compare the image recognition speed, image&#xD;
      recognition accuracy and precision of endoscopists with and without the assistance of&#xD;
      artificial intelligence system.&#xD;
