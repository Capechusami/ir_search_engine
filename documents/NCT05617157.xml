      1. Purpose/objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The purpose of the current study is to investigate whether the benefits of stair&#xD;
           stepping established for early day food consumption extend to late day food consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will perform two standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), consuming 75g&#xD;
           of glucose dissolved in 350mL of water followed by assessment of glycemic markers for 2&#xD;
           hours. Participants will perform the OGTTs in the evening of two separate days. One day&#xD;
           will be the control condition, where participants will remain seated throughout the&#xD;
           entire duration of the OGTT. The other day (in randomized order) participants will&#xD;
           perform 1 min of stair stepping at a self-selected, comfortable pace 28min after the&#xD;
           consumption of the glucose solution. Blood glucose measurement via standard, over the&#xD;
           counter finger sticks will be performed every 10 min for the first hour, and again at 90&#xD;
           and 120min of the OGTT. In addition, standard venipuncture blood draws (5mL) will be&#xD;
           drawn at baseline ad at peak (30min) glucose excursion for the assessment of insulin.&#xD;
           Participants will be instructed to not vary their diet or exercise during the two&#xD;
           testing days. Diet and activity logs will be collected and analyzed to verify&#xD;
           compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects Adults 18 or over will be recruited for this project. Prior to enrolling in the&#xD;
           study, each potential participant will complete the Physical Activity Recall&#xD;
           Questionnaire (PAR-Q+) to screen for cardiovascular risks. Any positive responses to&#xD;
           questions from the PAR-Q+ will eliminate the individual from selection. Participants who&#xD;
           self report any condition that will prevent them form safely and/or comfortably climbing&#xD;
           stairs will also be excluded form participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Planned analyses: Results will be analyzed via a 2-factor repeated measure analysis of&#xD;
           variance for time and condition. Statistical significance will be set at an alpha level&#xD;
           of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Potential benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study will help to identify the shortest possible bout of exercise that is still&#xD;
           effective in significantly reducing postprandial blood glucose using a simple, cheap,&#xD;
           and ubiquitously available exercise mode - stair stepping. In addition, participants&#xD;
           will be informed of their fasting and postprandial glycemic response if they so desire.&#xD;
           At the end of the study, individuals that want their test results will be given a copy.&#xD;
           However, we cannot guarantee the subjects will benefit from this information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Potential risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks are comparable to regular everyday life. Stair stepping performed in this study&#xD;
      presents the same risk of falling or errant stepping related injuries as any other stair&#xD;
      stepping at a comfortable pace. Finger sticks and venipunctures present no greater risk than&#xD;
      a regular routine physical examination. Whenever blood is drawn, there is a small risk of&#xD;
      bruising or infection.&#xD;
