  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-risk precancerous cervical lesions are divided into stage 2 and 3 cervical&#xD;
      intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2 and 3). CIN 3 represents a direct pre-stage of invasive&#xD;
      cancer, has a high rate of progression and a high degree of agreement with the final&#xD;
      histological diagnosis. In CIN 2 lesions, the rate of agreement with the final histological&#xD;
      diagnosis is lower and the rate of spontaneous regression is higher. Due to the higher rate&#xD;
      of regression and possible complications after excisional treatment, conservative active&#xD;
      monitoring can be considered in selected young CIN 2 patients. A recent meta-analysis&#xD;
      reported a high rate of spontaneous clinical regression of CIN 2, particularly in women under&#xD;
      30 years old. There are currently no prospectively validated prognostic biomarkers to&#xD;
      determine which CIN 2 will progress to higher grade and which will regress to lower grade of&#xD;
      change. Recent research has studied HPV methylation and microbiome analysis as biomarkers. A&#xD;
      number of studies have shown that host cell DNA methylation levels in cervical scrapes&#xD;
      increase with underlying cervical disease severity and are highest in cervical cancer. DNA&#xD;
      methylation involves the covalent binding of a methyl group to the 5´ position of a cytosine&#xD;
      molecule in CpG dinucleotides. Besides global hypomethylation, the overall loss of&#xD;
      methylation during carcinogenesis, resulting in chromosomal instability, and the silencing of&#xD;
      tumour suppressor genes by local hypermethylation of CpG-rich promoter regions contribute to&#xD;
      cancer development. Gene promoter methylation can be easily accessed by sensitive,&#xD;
      quantitative methylation-specific PCR providing an objective test outcome. The aim of this&#xD;
      study was to determine the effect of the methylation rate of two suppressor genes- FAM19A4&#xD;
      and hsa-mir-124 on the rate of CIN 2 regression, persistence or progression in women younger&#xD;
      than 36 years (≤35 years old).&#xD;

    <description>After being diagnosed with CIN 2, patients will first be contacted by telephone and invited to participate in the study. If patients agree to participate in the research, they will sign a consent to participate in the research. After that, we will perform a colposcopy and take a cervical swab for analysis with the QIAsure Methylation Test Kit (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, USA), which will determine the methylation of tumor suppressor genes FAM19A4 and has-mir-124. Patients will complete a questionnaire. The total duration of tracking in both groups will be two years. The QIAsure Methylation Test will be performed to analyze methylation. It is a methylation-specific PCR test that detects hypermethylation of the tumor promoter suppressor genes FAM19A4 and has-mir-124. The samples on which we will use this test are bisulfite-converted DNA obtained by triage test for high-risk HPV - Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA Test (hc2, Qiagen, Gaithersburg, USA).</description>
