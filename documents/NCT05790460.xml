      The goal of this trial is to design and test a telehealth nurse navigation intervention for&#xD;
      patients with suspected locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC to improve timely&#xD;
      molecularly-informed treatment recommendations through early integration of concurrent&#xD;
      molecular testing.&#xD;

      The overarching goal of this pilot trial is to design and test a nurse navigation&#xD;
      intervention delivered via telehealth for patients with suspected locally advanced/metastatic&#xD;
      NSCLC to improve timely molecularly-informed treatment recommendations through early&#xD;
      integration of concurrent molecular testing (i.e., tumor tissue and plasma-based molecular&#xD;
      testing or plasma only when tumor tissue is insufficient/unavailable). The central hypothesis&#xD;
      is that providing telehealth nurse navigation to support completion of concurrent molecular&#xD;
      testing will result in higher rates of comprehensive testing, improved timeliness of&#xD;
      molecularly-informed treatment recommendations (primary endpoint), earlier initiation of&#xD;
      molecularly-informed treatment, more meaningful patient-clinician communication, and higher&#xD;
      levels of overall satisfaction among patients and clinicians. Drawing from systematic&#xD;
      evidence on the role of navigation for coordination of cancer care and informed by insights&#xD;
      from communication science and behavioral economics, the specific telehealth strategy to be&#xD;
      tested is synchronous telehealth nurse navigation in combination with default ordering of&#xD;
      plasma-based testing.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in the intervention arm will be scheduled for an enhanced synchronous telehealth visit with a trained lung cancer nurse navigator prior to tissue biopsy. The enhanced synchronous telehealth visit will ideally occur between the initial clinical appointment and diagnostic biopsy (typically a period between two and seven days). In addition to the activities conducted as part of usual care, the nurse navigator will: 1) provide more detailed and individualized education on lung cancer and the rationale for comprehensive molecular testing, including plasma-based tests; and 2) if the patient agrees to testing, pend a default order for plasma-based molecular testing (if not already ordered) for the clinician to sign and arrange for phlebotomy to be performed at the time of the patient's tissue biopsy.</description>

    <description>Patients in the usual care arm will receive a telephone call from a trained lung cancer nurse navigator after biopsy, as is typical at Penn Medicine, to 1) review the roles of clinicians on the medical oncology care team; 2) provide brief education on lung cancer; and 3) review the patient's diagnostic history and coordinate collection or completion of imaging required for guideline-recommended cancer staging. At the initial in-person oncology visit, the oncologist may choose to order plasma-based testing if appropriate (and if not already ordered or pending).</description>
