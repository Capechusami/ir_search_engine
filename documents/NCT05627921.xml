  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a group of movement and posture disorders associated with a&#xD;
      non-progressive affect during brain development that can cause limitation of activity and&#xD;
      disability. The most common movement disorders in CP are spasticity and dystonia. Currently,&#xD;
      the treatment of muscle stiffness called spasticity includes physiotherapy, casting and&#xD;
      device, various drugs and surgical treatment. Botulinum toxin injection into the muscle also&#xD;
      acts by reducing muscle contraction. ESWT is a method used in various musculoskeletal&#xD;
      diseases. It has been previously applied to pediatric patients and has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective and painless in ankle muscle stiffness. However, there are few studies&#xD;
      investigating the effect of ESWT on functionality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a permanent, non-progressive disorder in movement, posture, and motor&#xD;
      development that occurs in the immature fetal or neonatal brain. Motor disturbances may be&#xD;
      accompanied by secondary musculoskeletal problems such as spasticity and contractures. In the&#xD;
      treatment of spasticity, various treatments such as exercise, occupational therapies,&#xD;
      ultrasound, electrical stimulation, physiotherapy applications such as ESWT, orthoses, oral&#xD;
      antispasticity agents, botulinum toxin injection, intrathecal baclofen, and surgery are&#xD;
      applied. Botulinum toxin type A is one of the most widely used pharmacological treatments in&#xD;
      the treatment of focal spasticity. Repeated injections may lead to the formation of&#xD;
      neutralizing antibodies, resulting in a decrease in BoNT-A activity. In addition, a decrease&#xD;
      in Botulinum toxin response may be observed due to the increase in intramuscular fat and&#xD;
      connective tissue. In addition, in some patients with diffuse spasticity, the total dose of&#xD;
      BoNT-A required may exceed the maximum dose. Therefore, various non-pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      methods are recommended in addition to BoNT-A in the management of spasticity. Extracorporeal&#xD;
      shock wave therapy (ESWT) is a treatment method for applying high pressure waves to the body.&#xD;
      The effectiveness of ESWT on spasticity in patients with upper motor neuron damage has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in previous studies. However, there are few studies investigating the effect of&#xD;
      ESWT after BoNT-A injection on muscle tone, functionality and quality of life. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shared the results of short-term follow-up after ESWT and BoNT-A injection.&#xD;

The patients in the second group will be injected with Botulinum toxin with the same procedure. 1 week after the injection, patients will receive 3 sessions of radial ESWT treatment, 1 session/week. rESWT application will be applied with the 'MODUS ESWT' device and a 35 mm radial soft applicator will be used.</intervention_model_description>
