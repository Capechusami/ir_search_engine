  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Republic of Korea, it is not easy to practice standard pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) or&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation (CR). In this study, the investigators will provide newly developed&#xD;
      smartphone application to patients with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular diseases. The&#xD;
      investigators want to confirm whether participants, who perform smartphone application based&#xD;
      12-week PR or CR program, present improved exercise capacity, dyspnea symptom, muscle&#xD;
      strength, or quality of life.&#xD;

    <measure>change of dyspnea symptom (Chronic respiratory disease group)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea symptom is measured according to the Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale.&#xD;
The mMRC scale is from 0 to 4:&#xD;
0: no breathlessness except on strenuous exercise&#xD;
shortness of breath when hurrying on the level or walking up a slight hill&#xD;
walks slower than people of same age on the level because of breathlessness or has to stop to catch breath when walking at their own pace on the level&#xD;
stops for breath after walking âˆ¼100 m or after few minutes on the level&#xD;
too breathless to leave the house, or breathless when dressing or undressing</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change of dyspnea symptom (Chronic cardiovascular disease group)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea symptom is measured according to the New York Heart Association Functional Classification (NYHA class).&#xD;
The NYHA class is from I to IV:&#xD;
Class I: No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation (feeling heart beats), or dyspnea (shortness of breath).&#xD;
Class II(Mild): Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.&#xD;
Class III(Moderate): Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.&#xD;
Class IV(Severe): Unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.</description>
