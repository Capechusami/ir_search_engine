  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to examine the effect of education given to&#xD;
      asthmatic children and their parents by taking health literacy into account on disease&#xD;
      self-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted with 88 children and their parents between October 2018 and July&#xD;
      2019. While education and booklets were given to both children and parents in intervention&#xD;
      group 1, only the children were given the education and the booklets in intervention group 2.&#xD;
      There was no intervention applied for the control group. Post-test was performed 3 weeks&#xD;
      after the education and then follow-ups were carried out in the next three months over the&#xD;
      phone.&#xD;

    <measure>Health Literacy for School-Aged Children - HLSAC</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Health Literacy for School-Aged Children - HLSAC, which was developed by Paakkari et al., is a brief, multidimensional, generic, theory-based, cross-national validated, self-administered instrument to measure the subjective health literacy level of school-aged children. This tool assesses health literacy in five areas among school-aged children: theoretical knowledge (items 1 and 5); practical knowledge (items 4 and 7); critical thinking (items 3 and 9); self-awareness (items 8 and 10), and citizenship (items 2 and 6). The scale items are rated on a four-point Likert-type scale (not at all true = 1, barely true = 2, somewhat true = 3, and absolutely true = 4). A score between 10 and 25 implies low health literacy, between 26 and 35, moderate health literacy, and between 36 and 40, high health literacy.</description>

    <measure>Health Literacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The health literacy levels of the parents were measured with the &quot;Health Literacy Scale&quot;. The scale is the short form of the Health Literacy Survey in Europe (HLS-E.U). The scale is a 25-item Health Literacy Index form. The scale consists of 25 items and 4 sub-dimensions: Accessing information (items 1-5), understanding information (items 6-12), valuing/evaluating (items 13-20), and implementing/using (items 21-25). The scale is a 5-point Likert type (1 = I am unable to do / I have no ability / impossible, 2 = I have a lot of difficulties, 3 = I sometimes have difficulties, 4 = I have difficulties, 5 = I have no difficulty). The total score that can be obtained from the scale is between 25 and 125.</description>

    <measure>Asthma Control Test</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>An asthma control test involves questions relating to daytime and nighttime asthma symptoms. This test helps determine if a person is controlling their asthma well. The test helps someone identify how their symptoms interfere with their day-to-day life. If individuals do not have sufficient control over their asthma in the long term, it can increase the risk of asthma attacks and lead to other health issues, such as lung infections, which can cause several symptoms. Five questions involve a 4-week recall of symptoms and how they affect a person's daily functioning. Each answer has a value of 1-5, and at the end of the test, the score for each answer is added to the total score, which may range from 5 to 25. The lower the score, the more a person lacks control of their condition. For example, someone does not have their asthma under control if they score 5 or 6. An individual has better control of their asthma if they score 20 or higher.</description>
