  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compression wraps treat venous leg ulcers when applied correctly. Often, clinicians apply the&#xD;
      wraps at the wrong compression, or the wrap loosens, stopping clinical benefits. The study&#xD;
      aims to show the feasibility of a smart compression prototype to maintain a set compression&#xD;
      level in healthy volunteers. Each volunteer will wear the prototype device on one leg and a&#xD;
      standard compression wrap on the other. Volunteers will pump their calves, walk, lie down,&#xD;
      and stand at zero, one, and four hours. A pressure sensor placed over each calf will record&#xD;
      the compression level during the activities. Volunteers will provide subjective feedback on&#xD;
      each device concerning comfort and usability. After four hours, researchers will remove the&#xD;
      standard wrap. Volunteers will use the prototype device during daily activities for three&#xD;
      days. During the three days, the volunteers will complete a daily journal. The journal will&#xD;
      capture the user experience and time the volunteer used the device. A final site visit allows&#xD;
      researchers to conduct exit interviews and download the history of applied compression.&#xD;
      Researchers will use the data to show that the prototype device maintains therapeutic&#xD;
      compression and prove the usability of the device.&#xD;
