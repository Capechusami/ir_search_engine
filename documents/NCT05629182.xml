    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video footage is used to review all 64 matches in the football tournament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All players actions are registered using the FIFA football language, such as, pass completed,&#xD;
      clearance, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential injury incidents are registered, and for each incident the injury location, contact&#xD;
      type, player reaction, velocity, location, game reaction, referee reaction, medical staff on&#xD;
      pitch, and outcome (e.g. substitution) are also registered.&#xD;

&#xD;
      All players actions are registered using the FIFA football language, such as, pass completed,&#xD;
      clearance,&#xD;
      etc.(https://www.fifatrainingcentre.com/en/resources-tools/football-language/index.php)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential injury incidents are registered, and for each incident the injury location, contact&#xD;
      type, player reaction, velocity, location, game reaction, referee reaction, medical staff on&#xD;
      pitch, and outcome (e.g. substitution) are also registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple descriptive statistics are used to create overviews of the outcomes described above,&#xD;
      including comparisons between actions which do or do not lead to potential injury incidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary analysis may be performed including injury diagnoses, if players consent as part&#xD;
      of another study on injury surveillance allowing video analysis of their injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No a priori sample size calculation was performed, as all potential injury incidents are&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
