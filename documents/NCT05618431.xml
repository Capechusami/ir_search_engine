    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted on pregnant patients for whom there is a suspicion of a&#xD;
      chromosomal abnormality of the fetus. These are patients eligible for non-invasive prenatal&#xD;
      screening as part of their usual pregnancy surveillance. This research aims to develop and&#xD;
      validate a new method for non-invasive prenatal testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective collection study will allow the collection of biological samples necessary&#xD;
      for the development, testing and validation of these new tests&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective : of the study is the validation of non-invasive prenatal tests for the&#xD;
      detection of chromosomal abnormalities by analyzing the fetal DNA present in maternal blood&#xD;
      by a new generation digital PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this research: is to validate the reliability of the test on both&#xD;
      populations (affected and unaffected) and its ability to detect the following anomalies:&#xD;
      Triple X and 22q.11.2 Micro-deletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type and methodology of research :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the only act of the research being the sampling of a maximum of 3 additional blood&#xD;
      tubes for a maximum volume of 30 mL during a blood test as part of the care, this study is&#xD;
      qualified as research involving the human person at risk and minimal constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provisional research calendar :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion period for subjects is 18 months, from the date of inclusion of the first&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the subjects' participation in this research protocol is related to the time&#xD;
      of inclusion and the procedure of blood collection by venipuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end of participation of patients included in the study is effective as soon as the&#xD;
      collection of the sample is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the non-inferiority of a new non-invasive test for the detection of chromosomal&#xD;
      abnormalities and to determine the accuracy of fetal sex classification by the new NIPT&#xD;
      method combined with next-generation digital PCR from acellular fetal DNA found in maternal&#xD;
      plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of test performance in both populations (affected and unaffected) Evaluation of&#xD;
      the performance of the test to detect the following anomalies: Triple X and 22q.11.2&#xD;
      Micro-deletion.&#xD;

    <description>As part of this study, comparative analyses will be carried out:&#xD;
For qualitative variables: Pearson's Chi Â² test will be used unless the estimated theoretical number in a cell is less than five, in which case the Yates continuity correction or the exact Fisher test will be applied.&#xD;
For quantitative variables: the t-test or an analysis of Student's variance will be performed. Otherwise, post-hoc analyses will be performed using the Student-Neuman-Keuls test. If the data is not distributed normally, nonparametric tests will be used.</description>
