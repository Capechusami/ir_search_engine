      The aim of this exploratory study is to investigate the short- and long-term efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of a cosmetic product combination consisting of a body lotion and an intensive&#xD;
      care product in subjects with atopic eczema over 3 months of use. Efficacy is assessed by&#xD;
      instrumental measurements of skin condition (sub-panel), clinical examinations, and&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;

      The objective of this exploratory study is to investigate the short- and long-term efficacy&#xD;
      and tolerability of a cosmetic product combination consisting of a body lotion and an&#xD;
      intensive care product in subjects with atopic eczema over 3 months of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For efficacy and tolerability evaluation, an objective dermatological assessment will be&#xD;
      performed, in addition to assessing efficacy, the severity of atopic eczema will be assessed&#xD;
      using the validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD). Further,&#xD;
      the effect of the test product combination on symptom severity, disease control (recap of&#xD;
      atopic eczema (RECAP)), quality of life and well-being will be evaluated by the subjects or&#xD;
      the subjects' parents/ legal guardians. The subjects or the subjects' parents/ legal&#xD;
      guardians will also document the frequency of flare-ups, required physician visits and the&#xD;
      use of cortisone administration as well as their/ their child's well-being in a diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the influence of the test product combination on the skin barrier will be&#xD;
      assessed in a sub-panel with dry legs by measuring the transepidermal water loss by Aquaflux&#xD;
      and by sampling of biological material for analysis of skin lipids and corneocyte maturity&#xD;
      before and after 3 months of product use.&#xD;
