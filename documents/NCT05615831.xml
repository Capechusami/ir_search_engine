  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to investigate whether six weeks of resistance training, in&#xD;
      combination with blood flow restriction, produces a different adaptation in fat-free mass&#xD;
      between males and females that are not physically active. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      compare changes in physical function, physical performance, and blood biomarkers between&#xD;
      males and females following resistance training and blood flow restriction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies indicated a reduced workload (i.e., lifting lighter weight) combined with&#xD;
      blood flow restriction leads to increased fat-free mass and muscle strength. However, females&#xD;
      have been underrepresented in the blood flow restriction literature. Therefore, no study has&#xD;
      investigated whether males and females of different age groups have different adaptations in&#xD;
      fat-free mass, muscle strength, and performance outcomes following resistance training using&#xD;
      blood flow restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be to investigate sex differences in fat-free mass following six&#xD;
      weeks of resistance training combined with blood flow restriction in young and older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to investigate sex differences in muscle strength, physical&#xD;
      performance, and blood biomarkers between males and females following resistance training and&#xD;
      blood flow restriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, participants between 19-30 years and 65 years and older will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in this study. Participants will present to the laboratory for two baseline&#xD;
      testing visits interspersed with a minimum of four days. The first testing visit will include&#xD;
      a variety of questionnaires, a blood draw, lipid and glucose, a dual-energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry scan, anthropometrics, and a submaximal VO2. The second visit will include&#xD;
      several physical function tests, such as the short physical performance battery and the&#xD;
      Y-balance test, as well as a high-intensity isokinetic fatigue test using isokinetic&#xD;
      dynamometry and 1-repetition maximum testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of baseline testing, participants are enrolled in the exercise program. The&#xD;
      first exercise session includes a blood draw before and immediately after the training&#xD;
      session. This procedure will be duplicated at the final exercise session at the end of the&#xD;
      six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' full occlusion will be estimated using the formula developed by Loenneke et al.&#xD;
      (2015). Then each participant's occlusion will be set at 60% of each individual's total limb&#xD;
      occlusion. This will be used in combination with the following exercises incline chest press,&#xD;
      seated row, leg press, knee extension, and knee flexion performed at 30% of 1RM. The protocol&#xD;
      is as follows: 30 repetitions followed by three sets of 15 repetitions for a total of four&#xD;
      sets and 75 repetitions per exercise. There will be a one-minute recovery between sets where&#xD;
      the cuffs remain inflated and a four-minute recovery between exercises where the cuffs will&#xD;
      be deflated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the completion of the six weeks of exercise, participants will again present to the&#xD;
      laboratory for two follow-up visits similar to the first two baseline visits.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will perform six weeks of blood flow restriction (60% occlusion) combined with resistance training at 30% of 1RM. The intervention comprises five exercises: incline chest press, seated row, leg press, knee extension, and knee flexion. The protocol is as follows: 30 repetitions followed by three sets of 15 repetitions for a total of four sets and 75 repetitions per exercise. There will be a one-minute recovery between sets where the cuffs remain inflated and a four-minute recovery between exercises where the cuffs will be deflated.</description>
