  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the primary spine practitioner (PSP) model of&#xD;
      care will lead to improvements in patient outcomes, as compared to usual care, based on&#xD;
      change in patient-reported PROMIS Pain Interference and Physical Function from baseline to 3&#xD;
      months in patients aged 18 years and older with a primary complaint of low back pain (LBP).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pragmatic, multi-site, two-arm cluster-randomized trial with the unit of&#xD;
      randomization at the primary care clinic level. The overall goal is to evaluate&#xD;
      implementation of the American College of Physicians (ACP) guideline for LBP by assessing the&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness of the PSP model, which involves first contact care for LBP&#xD;
      patients from either a physical therapist (PT) or a doctor of chiropractic (DC), versus usual&#xD;
      care, which involves first contact care with primary care physicians. The study includes&#xD;
      patients aged 18 years and older with a chief complaint of LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-primary endpoints to be assessed are changes in Patient- Reported Outcomes Measurement&#xD;
      Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference and Physical Function from baseline to 3&#xD;
      months. The Investigators have chosen to use these co-primary endpoints as they represent two&#xD;
      domains that are important factors related to patient improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months include Pain Catastrophizing&#xD;
      Scale - 4-item short form, PROMIS Global-10 (v1.2), total prescribed opioid dosage, imaging&#xD;
      and diagnostic testing, provider visits, and LBP-associated procedures and treatments:&#xD;
      surgical procedures, medication prescriptions, hospital admissions and emergency room visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional exploratory analyses among enrolled patients will assess whether the PSP model&#xD;
      leads to 1) long-term improvement compared to usual care using the PROMIS Pain Interference&#xD;
      and Physical Function at 6, 12, and 24 months; and 2) lower healthcare utilization and costs&#xD;
      for LBP at 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled within the first 18 months of the data collection phase will be included in&#xD;
      the 24-month exploratory analyses. Additional analyses will evaluate LBP-related utilization&#xD;
      within the academic healthcare systems among all patients seen in intervention versus control&#xD;
      primary care clinics utilizing de-identified clinic level data extracted from the EHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of approximately 1,800 patients who seek care at a participating primary care clinic&#xD;
      with a complaint of LBP and meet study eligibility criteria will be enrolled.&#xD;
