  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient with childhood hydrocephalus (HC) tend to present late in Low medium income countries&#xD;
      (LMICs). This project will study the barriers leading to patients' and health system delay in&#xD;
      patients with childhood HC. This will be done via a quantitative and qualitative study&#xD;
      analysis. The data will be collected prospectively.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children less than 5 years of age with HC confirmed with either magnetic resonance or&#xD;
      computerized tomographic images will be recruited. In addition, Hospital staff members, who&#xD;
      have been working within the Neurosurgical unit for at least 5 years will be interviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' data that will be collected will include gender, age at presentation,&#xD;
      socioeconomic class of parents (or guardians), religion, referral source, presenting&#xD;
      complaint with its duration, physical findings, ventricular diameter. The Pre-presentation&#xD;
      symptoms interval (PPI) will be defined as the number of days between the onset of symptoms&#xD;
      and first presentation at any type of healthcare service centre (including primary healthcare&#xD;
      centre, secondary health institutions); Presentation Interval (PI)- Number of days from&#xD;
      symptoms to presenting at Neurosurgical centre; Pre-diagnostic interval (PDI) will be defined&#xD;
      as the interval in days between symptoms and completion of pre-operative investigations.&#xD;
      Patient interval (PI) will be defined as the number of days from the onset of symptoms and&#xD;
      patient's first contact with the Neurosurgical center. Hospital interval (HI)- number of days&#xD;
      from completion of investigations to surgical intervention. The collected data will be&#xD;
      analyzed according to qualitative conventional content analysis. Nvivo software version 13&#xD;
      and Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) version 23 will be used for data&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
