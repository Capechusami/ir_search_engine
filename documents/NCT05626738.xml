    <textblock>
      Patients with long lasting colonoscopy are characterized by higher risk of incompletion.&#xD;
      Endorail is an accessory for colonoscopy aimed at facilitating progression of the endoscope&#xD;
      in the large intestine. Endorail works as a magnetic anchor that is able to guide the&#xD;
      colonoscope and to straighten colon curves and loops. The aim of this study is to test the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of Endorail in ensuring that incompletion rate in long-lasting&#xD;
      colonoscopies is lower than the 10% threshold. Outpatients of either sex aged between 22-75&#xD;
      years undergoing elective diagnostic or surveillance colonoscopy with caecal intubation time&#xD;
      greater than 10 minutes will take part in the study. The primary efficacy endpoint is the&#xD;
      percentage minor or equal to 10% of incomplete long-lasting colonoscopies. The primary safety&#xD;
      endpoints are the absence of device-related serious adverse events and the evaluation of the&#xD;
      equality or reduction of the adverse events rates compared to diagnostic colonoscopies&#xD;
      without Endorail.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with long lasting colonoscopy are characterized by higher risk of incompletion. A&#xD;
      colonoscopy can be defined as incomplete when the endoscopist cannot reach the caecum. Caecal&#xD;
      intubation is one of the main goals of colonoscopy and represents a diagnostic quality&#xD;
      indicator. International guidelines recommend caecal intubation rates ≥90% for all&#xD;
      colonoscopies in daily clinical practice. Reported incomplete colonoscopy rates range from 4%&#xD;
      to 25%. Caecal intubation fails in 4-10% of cases in tertiary referred centres, instead in&#xD;
      national surveys colonoscopies are incomplete in 10-25% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endorail is a medical device intended to facilitate the positioning of a standard&#xD;
      colonoscope. Endorail is a colonoscopy add-on device that works as a magnetic anchor able to&#xD;
      guide the colonoscope and to straighten colon curves and loops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endorail is composed by the following two CE marked medical devices: Endorail Set and&#xD;
      Endorail System. Endorail Set consists of the Endorail Balloon Guide, The Endorail Solution&#xD;
      Syringe, The Endorail Powder and the Spike. Endorail System consists of the Endorail&#xD;
      Handpiece and the Endorail Cart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of the Endorail in ensuring that&#xD;
      incompletion rate in long-lasting colonoscopies is lower than the 10% threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatients of either sex aged between 22-75 years, undergoing elective colonoscopy for&#xD;
      diagnostic or surveillance colonoscopy, who have signed a written informed consent and&#xD;
      presenting caecal intubation time greater than 10 minutes, will take part in the study. The&#xD;
      study plan will include a screening/baseline/treatment visit (Visit 1/Day 1), during which&#xD;
      colonoscopy with the investigational medical device Endorail will be performed and a phone&#xD;
      follow-up visit (Visit 2), scheduled at 7 (± 1) day after treatment with the investigational&#xD;
      medical device Endorail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage minor or equal to 10% of incomplete&#xD;
      long-lasting colonoscopies&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary safety endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The absence of device-related serious adverse events. AND&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The evaluation of the equality or reduction of the adverse events rates compared to&#xD;
           diagnostic colonoscopies without Endorail.&#xD;

    <description>In case of long-lasting colonoscopy, the Endorail Balloon Guide can be inserted inside the endoscope tool channel. It is connected at its proximal (user) end to the syringe containing the Ferromagnetic Fluid. The anchored balloon guide allows to straighten the scope and thus the colon itself. As it is kept in tension, its rigidity increases and works as a rail supporting the movements of the colonoscope. The guided colonoscope can thus be easily moved back and forward to allow better colonoscope positioning and colonoscopy completion. After the Endorail is removed, the straightened colonoscope can be easily pushed forward to achieve colonoscopy completion as foreseen in standard endoscopic technique.</description>

    <description>In case caecal intubation time is longer than 10 minutes, the balloon catheter is inserted in the tool channel, advanced beyond the colonoscope tip and filled with Ferromagnetic Fluid. By applying the Endorail Handpiece over the patient abdomen, the balloon can be magnetically anchored. The anchored balloon guide allows to straighten the scope and the colon itself. The colonoscope can thus be easily moved back and forward along the anchored guide to facilitate colonoscope positioning and colonoscopy completion. Afterward, Endorail is removed and the straightened colonoscope can be easily pushed forward to achieve colonoscopy completion according to standard endoscopic technique.</description>
