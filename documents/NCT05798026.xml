      Phase 1 (dose escalation) of this study will evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and tolerability of EU103 treatment are evaluated for patients with advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumors who have failed standard therapy to determine the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose and recommended Phase 2 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And preliminary efficacy (tumor response), The pharmacokinetic characteristics are evaluated,&#xD;
