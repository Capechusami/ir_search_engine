  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic carcinoma patients got benefit from adjuvant therapy after radical surgery.&#xD;
      Gemcitabine combined with albumin-paclitaxel was recommended as the first-line regimen for&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy by NCCN guidelines. The most common non-hematological adverse events&#xD;
      associated with gemcitabine combined with albumin-paclitaxel treatment were fatigue (54%),&#xD;
      followed by alopecia (50%), and grade 3 or higher adverse events were mainly&#xD;
      granulocytopenia, leukopenia, fatigue, and peripheral nerve damage. Cancer-related fatigue&#xD;
      (CRF) is the most common concomitant symptom in cancer patients, especially during&#xD;
      chemotherapy, which has a negative impact on patients' work, social relationships, emotions&#xD;
      and daily activities. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to improve CRF in&#xD;
      cancer patients. From the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine, CRF patients will have&#xD;
      a series of syndromes such as low function of viscera, general weakness, and emaciation,&#xD;
      which last for more than 2 weeks and affect patients' physiology and psychology at the same&#xD;
      time. Codonopsis pilosula Nnannf can restore the postoperative immune ability of patients as&#xD;
      soon as possible after chemotherapy.&#xD;
