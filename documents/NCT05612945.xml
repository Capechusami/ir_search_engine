    <textblock>
      Supervised exercise training (SET) is considered among first-line therapies for patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD), combined with general&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk management, lifestyle adaptation and pharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although without clear consistency, the guidelines give recommendations in terms of&#xD;
      claudication pain severity, SET volume, duration, and frequency. However, no or little&#xD;
      guidance is offered as far as training intensity is concerned. Most of the previous studies&#xD;
      on SET, in the context of PAD, did not distinguish between symptom intensity and common&#xD;
      training intensity measures such as % of maximal heart rate (%HRmax), % of HR reserve (%HRR),&#xD;
      % of peak oxygen uptake (%VO2peak), % of VO2 reserve (%VO2R), or the rate of perceived&#xD;
      exertion (RPE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent meta-analysis, we demonstrated that both training modality and exercise intensity&#xD;
      (based on %peak heart rate, %peak oxygen uptake, or the rate of perceived exertion) should be&#xD;
      considered when looking for the best results in patients with symptomatic PAD. These results&#xD;
      call for study of the individual roles of each exercise intensity and modality on walking&#xD;
      performance and cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with symptomatic PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is composed of brief bursts of vigorous intensity&#xD;
      interspersed with periods of rest or low-intensity exercise. HIIT may be better than&#xD;
      moderate-intensity training (MIT) in improving cardiorespiratory fitness and functional&#xD;
      capacity in patients with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, but in patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic PAD, the effects of such modalities on walking ability and cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      fitness remain to be clearly determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effects of 12-week-long exercise&#xD;
      training (short-duration high-intensity intervals vs. low-to-moderate intensity) on treadmill&#xD;
      performance in patients with symptomatic PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that treadmill performance would be improved to a greater extent after&#xD;
      high-intensity exercise training&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects more than 200 million people&#xD;
      worldwide. PAD is characterized by atherosclerotic lumen narrowing or occlusion of the lower&#xD;
      limb arteries, leading to an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand downstream,&#xD;
      especially in activated muscle during exertion. The hallmark symptom of PAD is typical&#xD;
      intermittent claudication, defined as reproducible exertion-induced cramping or pain in the&#xD;
      lower extremities, which is rapidly relieved with rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with symptomatic PAD avoid exertion and tend to have muscle weakness, an altered&#xD;
      gait and lower limb biomechanics. This results in impaired walking performance, accelerated&#xD;
      functional decline, and reduced quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supervised exercise training (SET) is considered among first-line therapies for patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic PAD, combined with general cardiovascular risk management, lifestyle adaptation&#xD;
      and pharmacological treatment. The clinical benefits of SET for patients with PAD are well&#xD;
      established, with improved walking capacity and an improved quality of life as the primary&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although without clear consistency, the guidelines give recommendations in terms of&#xD;
      claudication pain severity, SET volume, duration, and frequency. However, no or little&#xD;
      guidance is offered as far as training intensity is concerned. Most of the previous studies&#xD;
      on SET, in the context of PAD, did not distinguish between symptom intensity and common&#xD;
      training intensity measures such as % of maximal heart rate (%HRmax), % of HR reserve (%HRR),&#xD;
      % of peak oxygen uptake (%VO2peak), % of VO2 reserve (%VO2R), or the rate of perceived&#xD;
      exertion (RPE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A meta-analysis by Parmenter et al. showed that vigorous (%HRpeak: 77-96, %VO2peak: 64-90,&#xD;
      RPE: 14-17) exercise training improved cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak) more than light-&#xD;
      to-moderate exercise therapy intensity in patients with PAD, but the changes in walking&#xD;
      performance in these patients remain to be determined. In a recent meta-analysis, we&#xD;
      demonstrated that both training modality and exercise intensity (based on %peak heart rate,&#xD;
      %peak oxygen uptake, or the rate of perceived exertion) should be considered when looking for&#xD;
      the best results in patients with symptomatic PAD. More precisely, we showed that, when&#xD;
      training modalities were considered, walking at vigorous intensity showed the greatest&#xD;
      improvement in maximal walking distance (MWD), while walking at light-to-moderate intensity&#xD;
      showed the greatest improvement in pain-free walking distance. We also showed that vigorous&#xD;
      was superior to light-to-moderate exercise intensity in improving cardiorespiratory fitness;&#xD;
      and that, when training modalities were considered, cycling and other non-walking forms of&#xD;
      training performed at vigorous intensity elicited the greatest improvements in&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of our meta-analysis call for study of the individual roles of each exercise&#xD;
      intensity and modality on walking performance and cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
