  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) is a debilitating and prevalent neurodegenerative disease&#xD;
      in older adults globally. Cognitive impairment, a hallmark of AD, is assessed through verbal&#xD;
      tests that require high specialization, and while accepted as screening tools for AD, general&#xD;
      practitioners seldom use them. AD can be diagnosed with expensive, invasive neuroimaging and&#xD;
      blood tests, but these are usually conducted when cognitive functioning is already severely&#xD;
      impaired. Thus, finding a novel, non-invasive tool to detect and differentiate mild cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (MCI) and AD is a prime public health interest. Self-figure drawings (a projective&#xD;
      tool in which individuals are asked to draw a picture of themselves), are easy to administer&#xD;
      and have been shown to differentiate between healthy and cognitively impaired individuals,&#xD;
      including AD. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (a type of deep neural network, applied to&#xD;
      analyze visual imagery) has advanced to assess health conditions using art products.&#xD;
      Therefore, the proposed study suggests utilizing CNN-based methods to develop and test an&#xD;
      application tailored to differentiate between drawings of individuals with MCI, AD, and&#xD;
      healthy controls (HC) using 4,000 self-figure drawings. This&#xD;

    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a 10-minute paper-based test that aims to detect MCI in older patients with symptomatology, suggesting impaired cognition. The MoCA is composed of 12 tasks to detect short-term memory, visuospatial ability, executive functioning, phonemic fluency, abstraction, attention, concentration, working memory, language, and orientation.</description>
