  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent medical and technological advances, optimal glycemic control (time in range;&#xD;
      TIR) and prevention of hypoglycemia remain significant challenges for people living with type&#xD;
      1 diabetes (T1DM). Automated insulin delivery systems (AIDs) combine an insulin pump coupled&#xD;
      via an algorithm with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), allowing constant adjustment of&#xD;
      insulin doses according to blood glucose levels. Despite the significant improvement in blood&#xD;
      glucose parameters and quality of life with these systems, they are not available to everyone&#xD;
      and more and more people with diabetes are resorting to home-made or do-it-yourself (DIY)&#xD;
      systems to access this technology. DIY systems are not approved or regulated by Health&#xD;
      Canada, despite the growing interest. There have been no studies looking at this type of&#xD;
      system in active people living with DbT1, including the risk of exercise-induced&#xD;
      hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IDA systems in&#xD;
      physically active individuals living with type 1 diabetes.This is a real-life observational&#xD;
      study in people with commercial IDA (control group) and IDA-DIY. This study includes only one&#xD;
      inclusion visit (which may be virtual) and the observation period is 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to wear their own artificial pancreas system and give us access&#xD;
      to blood glucose and insulin data at the end of the study. They will be required to wear a&#xD;
      watch to record physical activity (FitBit). We will ask them to complete information about&#xD;
      their diet at least twice a week for a whole day (Keenoa application).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, participants will be asked to complete a physical activity diary to complete data&#xD;
      (carbohydrates in prevention of activity, insulin suspension, hypoglycemia during or after&#xD;
      exercise, etc.).&#xD;
