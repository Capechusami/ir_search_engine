  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the SARS-CoV-2 virus being present worldwide, and although it is now clear that&#xD;
      children are affected by the disease with milder symptoms than adults, many immunological&#xD;
      questions, which are very relevant for Public Health reasons and for the organization of&#xD;
      services, remain unsolved. The role of serology for the diagnosis of COVID-19, particularly&#xD;
      in the pediatric age, is still very uncertain. Preliminary evidence suggests that not all&#xD;
      children with SARS-Cov-2 infection develop antibody levels that can be detected by currently&#xD;
      employed methods. This makes it crucial to identify other methodologies that are able to&#xD;
      evaluate the true prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pediatric population. Many&#xD;
      other aspects of the immunological mechanisms of response to SARS-CoV-2 are also uncertain,&#xD;
      such as the role of cellular immunity, and generally the role of immunity (cellular and&#xD;
      antibody) in protecting against the disease in the medium and long term. Finally, questions&#xD;
      remain open regarding cross-immunity with other previously circulating coronaviruses and&#xD;
      their impact on the pediatric population in terms of protection against COVID-19 infection,&#xD;
      disease development, or reinfection. This study aims to help clarify the role of serology and&#xD;
      other immune response tests in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the pediatric population.&#xD;
      Specifically, it aims to assess: the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion cases among the&#xD;
      pediatric population accessing the National Health System (NHS), at different moments in time&#xD;
      and in different regions of Italy; whether cellular immunity tests can help to identify&#xD;
      children who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly children with low antibody levels,&#xD;
      and thus to better estimate the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection; the prevalence of&#xD;
      cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses; whether immunity (antibody and cellular) is&#xD;
      protective in the medium/long term; and if there are healthy carriers, i.e. individuals who&#xD;
      have had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, who are asymptomatic but may harbor SARS-CoV-2 in the&#xD;
      pharynx, with the risk of transmitting it.&#xD;
