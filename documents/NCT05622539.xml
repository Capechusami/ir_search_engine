      Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered prognostic tools and clinical decision support systems&#xD;
      can predict the outcome of certain diseases based on a multitude of patient data at high&#xD;
      speed, facilitating decisions by healthcare professionals. In acute ischemic stroke, the&#xD;
      overall treatment effect and population-wide outcome benefit of treatments such as IV&#xD;
      thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy are well established. However, in individual&#xD;
      patients it is difficult to predict the prognosis in the acute phase of stroke: some patients&#xD;
      are candidates for these treatments, but may have poor clinical outcomes (no improvement of&#xD;
      stroke or even worsening) Our aim in this study is to validate an artificial intelligence&#xD;
      (AI)-based prognostic tool to provide accurate real-time outcome prediction in patients with&#xD;
      acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, all patients admitted to the emergency room with an acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
      will receive the usual treatment for acute stroke in accordance with the stroke neurologists&#xD;
      in charge. A &quot;shadow&quot; clinical researcher, without interaction with treating physicians, will&#xD;
      collect the data required by the AI model in vivo. These data will be obtained by filling in&#xD;
      clinical data through an App on a hospital mobile/tablet, and by a connection with your&#xD;
      electronic medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AI models will estimate the outcome of the acute stroke patient, and this prediction will&#xD;
      be compared with the real outcome of the patient after 3 months of follow-up.&#xD;

      Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered prognostic tools and clinical decision support systems&#xD;
      have the ability to predict the outcome of certain diseases based on a multitude of patient&#xD;
      data at high speed, facilitating decisions by healthcare professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In acute ischemic stroke, the overall treatment effect and population-wide outcome benefit of&#xD;
      IV thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy are well established. However, the outcome still&#xD;
      differs significantly for individual patients, where some are eligible for treatment but may&#xD;
      have catastrophic outcomes. Multiple prognostic variables and their combination in a single&#xD;
      patient make it difficult to predict individual outcomes after stroke treatment. We aim to&#xD;
      validate an AI prognostic tool to provide accurate outcome prediction in patients with acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke in a prospective observational follow-up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis AI-based models can be applied in real-time in acute stroke patients and provide&#xD;
      an early accurate prediction of their outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology The study complies two phases. Phase 1: retrospective study. While technological&#xD;
      readiness will be achieved for the clinical validation study further model refinement on&#xD;
      heterogeneous data will be performed based on existing models that have been developed on&#xD;
      extensive high-quality medical data. VALIDATE will analyse retrospective databases from the 3&#xD;
      clinical sites involved in the study to test and validate the previously generated AI models.&#xD;
      Encrypted data of all acute ischemic stroke patients admitted to the centres during 2018-2021&#xD;
      period will fed the AI models to validate the model's accuracy comparing the outcomes&#xD;
      predicted by the AI modelling with those of the actual patients. The dataset includes&#xD;
      demographics, baseline clinical characteristics, risk factors, neuroimaging data, acute&#xD;
      treatments, clinical evaluation (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)),&#xD;
      functional evaluation at 3-6 months (mRS), patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), etc.&#xD;
      The interaction between these data sets and the AI models will be done through a federated&#xD;
      learning procedure, that is, the data will be analyzed on our hospital servers, and they will&#xD;
      not be transferred to any other center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grading the contribution of the progressively complex diagnostic procedures to the AI models&#xD;
      and establishing a set of the minimum relevant variables for the AI model able to accurately&#xD;
      predict functional outcome will also be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Prospective multicenter observational shadowing study. consecutive acute stroke&#xD;
      patients admitted to 3 high-volume comprehensive stroke centres will be evaluated. All&#xD;
      patients will receive the usual stroke work-up and standard of care treatment according to&#xD;
      the treating physicians. A shadow clinical researcher with no interaction with the treating&#xD;
      physicians will recollect in vivo the data required by the AI modelling. These data will be&#xD;
      obtained by filling of clinical data through an app and by connection with the electronical&#xD;
      medical record of the patient to obtain additional baseline and neuroimaging data. The real&#xD;
      outcomes of the patients will be measured through clinician and patient reported outcomes&#xD;
      measurements (CROMs and PROMs), and they will be compared with the estimated outcomes&#xD;
      according to the AI model. PROMS after 7 days, 1 and 3 months will be obtained through the&#xD;
      implementation of an innovative nudging-based digital platform (NORA) to improve&#xD;
      patient-clinician communication and follow-up. An electronic case report form (eCRF) will be&#xD;
      designed to recollect key process indicators (KPI) and CROMs, which will be integrated in the&#xD;
      NORA platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation has been based on the results of a clinical dataset of&#xD;
      consecutive code stroke patients admitted to Hospital Vall d'Hebron during the year 2020. It&#xD;
      has been used as an example of the usual mRS distribution at 3 months in a cohort of&#xD;
      consecutive acute stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a test for agreement between two raters using the Kappa statistic, a sample size of 182&#xD;
      subjects achieves 95% power to detect a true Kappa value of 0,7 in a test of H0: Kappa = κ0&#xD;
      vs. H1: Kappa ≠ κ0 when there are three categories with frequencies equal to 0,58, 0,34, and&#xD;
      0,08. This power calculation is based on a significance level of 0,05 and a minimum&#xD;
      acceptable kappa (κ0) of 0.6 (moderate agreement) and an expected kappa (κ1) of 0.8&#xD;
      (substantial agreement). Assuming a drop-out rate of 20% for the 90-day follow-up the&#xD;
      Dropout-Inflated Expected Enrolment (DIEE) Number would be 218 patients with acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
