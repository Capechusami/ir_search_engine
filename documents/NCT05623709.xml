    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting an estimated&#xD;
      1 in 10 Canadians. Symptoms include persistent shortness of breath, cough and sputum&#xD;
      production. The symptoms can be serious when people with COPD experience a flare of their&#xD;
      disease and may lead to hospitalization or death. Improving other conditions that affect COPD&#xD;
      control is one way to improve the health of people with COPD. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)&#xD;
      is the most common breathing problem during sleep, and commonly co-exists with COPD. Although&#xD;
      diagnosing and treating OSA is encouraged, it has not been highlighted in guidelines that&#xD;
      recommend ideal COPD care. People with COPD and OSA have lower sleep quality and lower oxygen&#xD;
      levels during sleep compared to people with OSA. Despite these differences, treatment of OSA&#xD;
      in people with COPD is modeled after treatment of OSA in the general population, generally&#xD;
      using treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with the possible addition of&#xD;
      oxygen through the CPAP machine. There are few studies looking at other types of treatment&#xD;
      including noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in people with COPD and OSA. The majority of studies&#xD;
      of NIV in COPD has been for people with other reasons to use NIV including acute respiratory&#xD;
      failure or chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure and did not include people with risk&#xD;
      factors for OSA or who had undergone overnight sleep studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Alberta, NIV is provided province wide for people who have both OSA who do not meet&#xD;
      certain physiologic targets in their oxygen levels or breathing patterns after CPAP is&#xD;
      applied on an overnight sleep study. NIV is provided preferentially to CPAP and oxygen,&#xD;
      providing an opportunity to look at health outcomes when NIV is used instead of CPAP for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with COPD. Through this study, we will measure whether people with COPD&#xD;
      and a sleep related breathing disorder such as OSA have fewer severe flares of COPD after&#xD;
      starting CPAP or NIV. We will evaluate whether the number of Emergency Department visits,&#xD;
      hospitalizations or deaths lowers after starting CPAP or NIV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a common chronic lung disease affecting more than&#xD;
      10% of Canadians. Patients with COPD have significant morbidity from the disease as almost&#xD;
      60% of Albertans living with COPD were hospitalized between 2012-2014. Sleep related&#xD;
      breathing disorders (SRBD) are a common comorbidity of COPD, and contribute to the morbidity&#xD;
      associated with COPD. The most common SRBD is OSA. It is estimated that 1.0-3.6% of Canadians&#xD;
      are affected by both OSA and COPD. People with COPD and OSA have lower sleep quality, lower&#xD;
      oxygen saturations and greater nocturnal oxygen desaturations when their sleep is compared to&#xD;
      people with OSA. Observational studies suggest that patients with OSA and COPD have a higher&#xD;
      risk of hospitalization, exacerbation of COPD, or death; however, the evidence to support the&#xD;
      assessment and management of OSA improving COPD health outcomes has not been considered&#xD;
      substantial enough to justify inclusion in COPD guidelines. Other SRBDs that may impact&#xD;
      patients with COPD are sleep-related hypoventilation as a consequence of obesity, or central&#xD;
      sleep apnea as a consequence of cardiac disease, stroke or use of opioids; however, these are&#xD;
      less common and less studied types of SRBD within sleep literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two treatments that are commonly prescribed for SRBD are CPAP or NIV. In patients with OSA,&#xD;
      CPAP improves quality of life, daytime sleepiness, and blood pressure control. In patients&#xD;
      with COPD who have OSA, observational studies suggest that CPAP use is associated with&#xD;
      survival, with the duration of CPAP use per night lowering mortality in a dose dependent&#xD;
      manner, an increased time to first moderate-severe COPD exacerbation and fewer&#xD;
      hospitalizations related to exacerbations of COPD. The association of decreased health care&#xD;
      utilization with CPAP is greater in patients with a higher COPD complexity and number of&#xD;
      comorbidities, indicating those who are the sickest may derive the most harm from untreated&#xD;
      disease. NIV is better tolerated than CPAP in some patients with OSA; yet, there have been&#xD;
      only a few studies evaluating its use for a SRBD in COPD. Further work in this area is&#xD;
      critically important as the indications for use of NIV are expanding among patients with&#xD;
      COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are uniquely positioned to complete this study as NIV is provided province-wide in Alberta&#xD;
      and patient health outcomes are available in provincial databases. In addition, within the&#xD;
      provincial titration protocol for polysomnography, NIV is provided preferentially over CPAP&#xD;
      with oxygen, differentiating the management of these patients from the titration protocols&#xD;
      used in other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this study, we will explore whether treatment with NIV or CPAP for a SRBD in patients&#xD;
      with COPD results in fewer moderate-severe exacerbations of COPD and whether the use of these&#xD;
      devices have an impact on health care utilization and mortality. In a subgroup analysis, we&#xD;
      will explore whether NIV use results in similar outcomes as CPAP, and account for differences&#xD;
      in disease severity in this comparison. Adherence with these CPAP or NIV will also be&#xD;
      summarized. The results from this study will inform regional care as well as provide insight&#xD;
      into the roles of CPAP and NIV in the treatment of SRBD in patients with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      59% of Albertans with COPD experience an exacerbation within a 2 year period; however, a&#xD;
      conservative estimate of 50% will be used for the power calculation. A clinically significant&#xD;
      difference in COPD exacerbations is estimated to be 25%. An estimated standard deviation of 8&#xD;
      patients hospitalized per 2 years was estimated (variance 64). Given that the exposure group&#xD;
      will be stratified by use of CPAP or NIV in subgroup analysis, a 2:1 proportion for the&#xD;
      exposure to comparison group was utilized and the exposure arm will be composed of equal&#xD;
      proportions of patients prescribed CPAP or NIV. A 10% drop out rate is anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis: Null hypothesis (H0): CPAP or NIV is equivalent to no therapy; Alternate&#xD;
      hypothesis (H1): CPAP or NIV is better than no therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis: Null hypothesis (H0): NIV is equivalent to CPAP; Alternate hypothesis&#xD;
      (H1): NIV is better than CPAP&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary hypothesis, these estimates suggest that a sample size of 165 patients is&#xD;
      required (n=110 patients in the exposure arm and 55 patients in the control arm). For the&#xD;
      secondary hypothesis, it is not anticipated that a large difference between CPAP or NIV will&#xD;
      be observed; however, the subgroup analysis of the primary outcome will be powered to detect&#xD;
      a 25% difference between intervention with CPAP or NIV.&#xD;

        The study setting are people living in Alberta receiving care by an adult respirologist who&#xD;
        undergo sleep diagnostic testing, consent to contact for research at a participating site,&#xD;
        are eligible for the study after a brief chart review, and who subsequently consent to be&#xD;
        involved in the study. The start date for CPAP or NIV will need to be within the study&#xD;
        period although it will not need to be after the date of sleep diagnostic testing in order&#xD;
        to allow patients started on NIV in hospital who subsequently undergo sleep diagnostic&#xD;
        testing to be eligible. Polysomnograms for eligible patients will be completed by sleep&#xD;
        laboratories operating within Alberta Health Services within the public health care system.&#xD;
        Home sleep apnea tests are performed by both private and public facilities within Alberta&#xD;
        and both sites of testing will be considered adequate for patient inclusion in the study if&#xD;
        that is the sole form of sleep diagnostic testing requested by the treating respirologist.&#xD;
