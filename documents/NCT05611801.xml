  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to learn about the safety and effects of the study&#xD;
      medicine (called marstacimab) for the potential treatment of hemophilia in pediatric&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll pediatric participants from ages 1 to 17 years in a sequential manner.&#xD;
      The study will open enrollment to adolescent participants aged 12 to 17 years first. Then&#xD;
      children aged 6 to 11 years will be permitted to enroll. Lastly, children aged 1 to 5 years&#xD;
      will be permitted to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll participants who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have severe Hemophilia A or moderately severe to severe Hemophilia B (with or without&#xD;
           inhibitors)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have accurate historical records documenting all factor VIII, factor IX, or bypass agent&#xD;
           infusions and hemophilia bleed events for at least 1 year prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if a non-inhibitor patient, must be on a stable routine prophylaxis regimen with factor&#xD;
           VIII or factor IX replacement products for at least 12 months prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if an inhibitor patient, must be on an on-demand bypass treatment regimen during the 12&#xD;
           months prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in this study will receive marstacimab to use prophylactically. Marstacimab&#xD;
      will be given once a week as a subcutaneous (under the skin) shot. The first dose of&#xD;
      marstacimab will be given at the study site by the study site staff. During the 12-month&#xD;
      treatment period, weekly doses of marstacimab can be given at home, or if preferred, the&#xD;
      doses may be given by the study site staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help us determine if the study medicine is safe and effective, we will compare participant&#xD;
      experiences when they are taking the study medicine to a historical period when they were&#xD;
      not. Researchers want to see if the study medicine works to prevent the bleeding episodes&#xD;
      commonly experienced by patients with Hemophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in this study for about 14 months (approximately 1 month in a Screening&#xD;
      period, 12 months receiving treatment, and 1 month in a follow-up period) during which they&#xD;
      will visit the study site at least 10 times. If preferred, and if local regulations allow it,&#xD;
      2 of the study visits can be completed at the participant's home instead of at the study&#xD;
      site. There will also be 6 scheduled telephone calls approximately every 2 months.&#xD;
