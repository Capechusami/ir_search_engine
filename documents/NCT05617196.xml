  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nova Scotians are aging and many are becoming frailer. People with frailty are more likely to&#xD;
      live in worse health and do not recover well from major events, such as open heart surgery.&#xD;
      Many people are also too frail to receive open heart surgery. Less invasive procedures called&#xD;
      transcatheter aortic valve implantation, or TAVI, are provided for the frailest patients.&#xD;
      While TAVI is life-saving, frailer patients are less likely to survive in better health after&#xD;
      their operation. Patients in Nova Scotia can also wait up to 3-6 months for their operation&#xD;
      where they become frailer or can die before receiving TAVI. The investigators believe that it&#xD;
      is important to support these individuals to improve their frailty and overall health before&#xD;
      their operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Center-based cardiac rehabilitation is offered to patients after, but not before TAVI to&#xD;
      improve their health. Center-based preoperative cardiac rehabilitation (i.e., PREHAB) can&#xD;
      safely improve the function of frail patients who received open heart surgery. However, many&#xD;
      patients cannot come to a center-based PREHAB because of transportation requirements to&#xD;
      access the program. Another option is to support these patients with virtually delivered&#xD;
      PREHAB, where they can stay in their homes. However, this possibility has not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, virtual PREHAB will be delivered using the virtual cardiac rehabilitation&#xD;
      program in Nova Scotia to patients before TAVI. This intervention will be delivered by&#xD;
      healthcare providers who routinely care for TAVI patients, including a medical director,&#xD;
      program lead, nurse, physiotherapist, and dietician. Ther goal of this study is to determine&#xD;
      if it is feasible and safe to use virtual PREHAB to reduce frailty before TAVI. This research&#xD;
      fits with Research Nova Scotia's priorities to improve patient outcomes in those with&#xD;
      significant long-term health conditions, and to provide accessible, safe, and quality virtual&#xD;
      healthcare to patients so they can thrive after their operation.&#xD;

The virtual PREHAB program will be up to 8-weeks in duration and deliver the core components of CR online or by telephone.</description>

    <description>The Virtual PREHAB program begins with a virtual health care team assessment. The physiotherapist will support patients in identifying ways to safely engage in home-based physical activities and in their neighborhoods. Additional weekly 30-minute telephone consultations with the physiotherapist, nurse, and dietitian are provided as well as three 30-minute online consultations are provided; telephone calls will replace these online consults if the patient does not have internet access. Telephone and/or online consults with participants will monitor the progression of the individual through the program, review patient materials, review medication changes, as well as provide recommendations to adopting a physically active lifestyle, diet, well-being, smoking, or other supports available to the patient. Medication changes are monitored by a nurse and any necessary medication recommendations involve the program's medical director, the patient's family physician, and TAVI team.</description>

    <description>In Nova Scotia, patients are referred to the TAVI program. The TAVI health care team, consisting of a cardiac surgeon, cardiologist, nurse, and geriatric team conduct patient assessments and provide guidance and resources on self management.Once patient assessments are completed, patients are discussed at a multidisciplinary team meeting. When a patient is accepted for TAVI, they are placed on a waiting list which lasts for 3-6 months depending on urgency.</description>
