  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to test the tolerability and clinical effectiveness of the study&#xD;
      drug, Letermovir (LET), when used as secondary prophylaxis following treatment of&#xD;
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in a solid organ transplant recipient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open label trial in which Letermovir will be prescribed to prevent the&#xD;
      recurrence of CMV infection and disease in a solid organ transplant recipient following&#xD;
      treatment of CMV infection or disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll solid organ transplant recipients who develop cytomegalovirus&#xD;
      infection and disease who have been treated. At the time of finishing treatment, if the&#xD;
      clinician feels that secondary prophylaxis is indicated, they will be enrolled to receive&#xD;
      Letermovir 480 mg orally once a day for 60 days. CMV specific T cell assays will be obtained&#xD;
      at the initiation of secondary prophylaxis and at the discontinuation of secondary&#xD;
      prophylaxis. Patients will be followed for 4 months following discontinuation of secondary&#xD;
      prophylaxis to see if they relapse.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adult (&gt; 18 years old) solid organ transplant recipients (heart, kidney or liver&#xD;
             patients) recovering from treated CMV disease in whom the clinician deems that the&#xD;
             patient need secondary prophylaxis and in whom written informed consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient able to participate with follow up for 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Not enrolled in competing clinical trials&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with creatinine clearance less than 10 ml per min at time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Hypersensitivity to letermovir or has a CMV isolate which is known to be resistant to&#xD;
             letermovir based on prior testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. On CVVH or renal dialysis at the time of enrollment&#xD;

             monoclonal antibody will be eligible to participate after a 150-day washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has previously participated or is currently participating in any study involving&#xD;
             administration of a CMV vaccine or another CMV investigational agent that is not&#xD;
             approved or is planning to participate in a study of a CMV vaccine or another&#xD;
             unapproved CMV investigational agent during the course of this study.&#xD;
