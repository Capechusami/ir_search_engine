  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recovery colleges (RC) aim to promote the recovery of people who experience mental&#xD;
      vulnerabilities. Rather than facilitating treatment of illness (as regular mental health care&#xD;
      services [MHCS] do), RCs are learning environments, with a special focus on peer support and&#xD;
      co-creation. While MHCS are founded on scientific and professional knowledge, RCs value the&#xD;
      knowledge and abilities of those with lived experiences as such. By sharing experiences, RC&#xD;
      attendees can inspire and support each other (hence 'peer support') and they can use their&#xD;
      experiences to contribute to the educational program (hence 'co-creation'). In the&#xD;
      Netherlands RCs are 100% peer run, meaning that no mental health care workers are involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite promising premature findings on the effectiveness of RC attendance (e.g., positive&#xD;
      impacts on MHCS use, mental wellbeing and functioning, quality of life, empowerment and&#xD;
      more), large, controlled studies are extremely scarce. Furthermore, the way RCs are managed&#xD;
      in the Netherlands seems to differ from the RCs that have been studied before. While RCs in&#xD;
      some countries are a coproduction of peers and mental health practicioners, RCs in the&#xD;
      Netherlands are 100% peer run, although they are usually hosted by MHCS. In turn, this&#xD;
      research project aims to investigate the (cost-)effectiveness of RCs in the Netherlands. In&#xD;
      terms of effectiveness, we expect that RC attendance improves feelings of empowerment.&#xD;
      Besides, we investigate impacts on quality of life, mental health, loneliness, satisfaction&#xD;
      with treatment and support and self-stigma. We also determine the cost-effectiveness of Dutch&#xD;
      RCs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This quantitative study is part of a larger research project that entails qualitative&#xD;
      analysis of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the meaning of Enik RC for its partakers (the first RC established in the Netherlands in&#xD;
           2015);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the position that RCs can and should have in the Dutch MHCS landscape;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a fidelity measure to define the core elements of Dutch RCs and to obtain an overview of&#xD;
           the available initiatives in the Netherlands&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research project is executed in close collaboration with co-researchers who are partakers&#xD;
      of Enik RC. The findings of the pre-registered quantitative study will be evaluated and&#xD;
      contextualized in co-creation as such.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: The Observational Study Model is both Cohort (monitoring for a period of 2 years) and&#xD;
      Case-Control (comparing RC partakers with non-partakers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: Enik Recovery College has 7 established locations in the region of Utrecht at the time&#xD;
      of our recruitment. All are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: Fameus has 4 established locations (Breda 2x, Tilburg, Roosendaal). All are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: This study is conducted both by Tilburg University (Department Tranzo) and&#xD;
      Trimbos-institute (Department of Reintegration and Cummunity Care) as primary organizations.&#xD;
      The PI is also affiliated with both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE. The aimed sample size at t0 is N=120 in the RC condition. So 120 partakers of RCs will&#xD;
      be matched with members from the PPG.&#xD;
