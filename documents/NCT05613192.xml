      Aim of work The aim of our study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of high oral&#xD;
      loading dose of inactive vitamin D supplementation on the clinical parameters related to&#xD;
      liver steatosis, glycaemic control, insulin resistance and metabolic profile in NAFLD&#xD;
      patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods The present study is prospective, simply (via computer generated&#xD;
      sequence) randomized controlled double blinded study, will be conducted on NAFLD patients in&#xD;
      the outpatient liver clinics of EL Sahel Teaching hospital, Cairo, Egypt, Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
      To be included in the study, patients have to fulfil the following inclusion criteria: male&#xD;
      or female patients &gt;19 years of age; presence of fatty liver detected by upper abdominal&#xD;
      ultrasound echography (US) and with diagnosis of T2D according to ADA 2019 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: The main exclusion criteria from the study are as follows: Pregnancy and&#xD;
      lactation, history of alcohol abuse (as defined by an average daily consumption of alcohol &gt;&#xD;
      30 g/day in men and &gt; 20 g/day women), cirrhosis, autoimmune hepatitis and other causes of&#xD;
      liver disease (viral hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease), drug induced hepatitis,&#xD;
      chronic enteropathies, Chronic kidney disease, hyper/hypoparathyroidism, known&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to cholecalciferol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hundred eligible patients will be included into the study and randomized by simple&#xD;
      randomization into either of the 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: 50 patients receive the standard conventional therapy in addition to placebo for 4&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: 50 patients receive the standard conventional therapy in addition to a single oral&#xD;
      dose of cholecalciferol 300,000 IU followed by oral cholecalciferol 800 IU daily for 4&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following laboratory tests will be measured: a- Glycaemic control: Fasting blood glucose&#xD;
      (FBG mg/dl), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C%), Fasting insulin (mU/L), Insulin resistance index&#xD;
      calculated by the homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) method using the&#xD;
      product of fasting insulin and fasting plasma glucose divided by 405. The cut off value of&#xD;
      HOMA-IR is more than 1.64.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b-Liver function tests: Alanine transaminase (ALT U/L), Aspartate transaminase (AST U/L),&#xD;
      Albumin (g/dl), Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT U/L), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP U/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      c- Lipid Profile: Low density lipoprotein (LDL-C mg/dl), High density lipoprotein (HDL-C&#xD;
      mg/dl), Triglycerides (TG mg/dl), Total cholesterol (TC mg/dl) d- Other markers: High&#xD;
      sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP mg/dl), Alfa fetoprotein (AFP ng/ml), serum 25-hydroxy&#xD;
      vitamin D (25(OH) D ng/ml) All Patients were followed up every 2 weeks by the clinical&#xD;
      pharmacist in charge through patient encounter to ensure the compliance to the treatment&#xD;
      regimen and to assess any adverse side effects.&#xD;
