      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART) therapy is a form of immunotherapy which can be used&#xD;
      to treat people with relapsed B-ALL. For those who achieve remission after CART alone, it may&#xD;
      cure up to 50% of people who receive this therapy. However, for people who relapse after&#xD;
      CART, it can be hard to achieve remission again. In patients where CART fails, stem cell&#xD;
      transplant (HCT) can be used to prevent relapse and achieve cure. But HCT can cause serious&#xD;
      side effects. Better testing is needed to distinguish people who can be cured with CART alone&#xD;
      from people who may also need to have HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if the use of a series of blood and bone marrow tests at regular intervals can help&#xD;
      monitor for B-ALL relapse after CART therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People aged 1 to 25 years with B-ALL who have had CART therapy within the past 42 days. They&#xD;
      must never have had a blood stem cell transplant; they must also have no measurable blood&#xD;
      cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the clinic every 2 weeks starting 42 days after they receive CART&#xD;
      therapy. Each visit will be about the same amount of time as a regular clinic visit. about 8&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have blood drawn for testing on each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow biopsy/aspirate will be done during 4 of the visits at routine timepoints after&#xD;
      CART. A needle will be inserted to draw a sample of tissue from inside the bone in the hip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small amount of blood and tissue will be tested with ClonoSEQ and to evaluate for normal&#xD;
      B-cells side by side with the standard tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combined testing may help determine whether participants are eligible for HCT and/or at&#xD;
      risk of relapse after CART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in the study for 1 year&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Given the dismal outcomes for patients who experience a relapse following CD19 CART and&#xD;
           the potential for using Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for post-CART remission&#xD;
           consolidation for relapse prevention, there is a clear opportunity to improve outcomes&#xD;
           for patients with B-ALL who proceed to CART. With a goal of improving overall survival,&#xD;
           it remains critically important to be able to predict which patients are at high risk of&#xD;
           relapse in whom an HCT would be indicated for remission consolidation. Distinguishing&#xD;
           this high-risk cohort from low-risk patients who are able to maintain durable remission&#xD;
           following CART and in whom HCT-associated toxicities could be avoided is equally&#xD;
           important.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thus, in the context of this biomarker-based study, we propose a systematic approach&#xD;
           utilizing the best-known biomarkers for remission monitoring which assess both&#xD;
           functional CART persistence and incorporates antigen immunophenotype agnostic approach&#xD;
           for disease detection will improve LFS post CD19 CART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To assess efficacy of a novel biomarker-guided risk-based strategy to monitor remission,&#xD;
      both by assessing functional CART persistence and incorporating antigen immunophenotype&#xD;
      agnostic approach (NGS monitoring) for disease detection, to inform decisions regarding&#xD;
      post-CART HCT needed intervention, and to successfully collect biomarker samples at the&#xD;
      scheduled times in enrolled HCT naive B-ALL participants receiving CD19 CART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt;=1 year and &lt;= 25 years old at the time of CD19 CART infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of CD19+ B-ALL in a bone marrow morphologic complete remission and are flow&#xD;
           cytometry measurable residual disease (MRD) negative within 42 days post CD19 CART&#xD;
           infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unsupported neutrophil count &gt; 500 cell/mm^3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must have an allogeneic HCT donor identified for potential HCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  B-cell aplasia post CD19 CART persisting until the time of the first on-study&#xD;
           intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -This single-arm multicenter study will enroll pediatric and young adult participants to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility, and potential efficacy, of a risk-based, biomarker-driven,&#xD;
      consolidation HCT strategy following CD19 CART.&#xD;

                  factor support by 42 days post CD19 CART infusion and within 4 days prior to the&#xD;
                  first on-study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received first CD19 (4-1BB) CART within 42 days prior to the first on-study&#xD;
             intervention. Note: Eligible CART including FDA approved Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel)&#xD;
             infused on a treatment plan, research study, or other comparable 4-1BB based&#xD;
             constructs.&#xD;

        Study chairs will determine whether other 4-1BB CART are considered comparable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All participants must have an allogeneic HCT donor identified for potential HCT. Note:&#xD;
             Donor identification and selection will be according to institutional practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have B-cell aplasia (BCA) post CD19 CART persisting within 14 days prior to the first&#xD;
             on-study intervention. Note: BCA persisting is defined as &lt;1% B cells lymphocytes or&#xD;
             &lt;50 B cells/microliter in the peripheral blood&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent history of the extramedullary disease (EMD) that requires ongoing radiographic&#xD;
             surveillance (e.g., participants with active EMD at CD19 CART infusion that requires&#xD;
             monitoring by imaging without the ability to more precisely assess disease status will&#xD;
             be ineligible). A remote history of EMD does not exclude the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active and/or residual central nervous system (CNS) disease that requires ongoing&#xD;
             therapy or monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Co-morbidities precluding myeloablative HCT. Note: Determination of co-morbidities&#xD;
             precluding myeloablative HCT will be made by the treating transplant (HCT) physician&#xD;
             and documented in the research record. This does not require that the participant is&#xD;
             immediately fully eligible for HCT, only that there are no long-term comorbidities&#xD;
             that would preclude a myeloablative approach (e.g., renal failure, severe cardiac&#xD;
             failure, long-term oxygen requirement).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled, symptomatic, intercurrent illness or social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements. Note: Determination of uncontrolled, symptomatic&#xD;
             illness or social situation that would limit compliance with the study requirements&#xD;
             will be made by the site-PI and documented in the research record.&#xD;
