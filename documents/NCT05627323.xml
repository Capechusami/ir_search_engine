  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b study to evaluate the safety of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells&#xD;
      with a chlorotoxin tumor-targeting domain (ie, CHM-1101, the study treatment) to determine&#xD;
      the best dose of CHM-1101, and to assess the effectiveness of CHM-1101 in treating MMP2+&#xD;
      glioblastoma that has come back (recurrent) or that is growing, spreading, or getting worse&#xD;
      (progressive).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b, multicenter, feasibility/safety study of the dual delivery (administered&#xD;
      through both intracavitary/intratumoral [ICT] and intraventricular [ICV] catheters) of&#xD;
      CHM-1101, an autologous chlorotoxin-chimeric antigen receptor (CLTX-CAR) cell product, in&#xD;
      participants with recurrent or progressive GBM. The investigational product is identified as&#xD;
      CHM-1101 (CLTX(EQ)28ζ/CD19t+ CAR T cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for dual ICT and ICV delivery of CHM-1101&#xD;
      in participants with MMP2+ recurrent or progressive GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the feasibility and safety of dual delivery of CHM-1101.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the persistence, expansion, immunogenicity, and phenotype of CHM-1101 and&#xD;
           endogenous cells tumor cyst fluid (TCF), peripheral blood (PB), and cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
           (CSF).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In participants who receive at least 2 of the 3 planned doses of CHM-1101 in Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) rates&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Estimate the overall survival (OS) rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the disease response rate.&#xD;
