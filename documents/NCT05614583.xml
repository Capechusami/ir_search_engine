  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled pilot study will be evaluating an app, MORT-PFPS app (ETH-01K),&#xD;
      owned by EverEx, Inc., to examine safety and effectiveness in individuals with patellofemoral&#xD;
      pain syndrome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled pilot study will enroll 40 participants, where half will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the app, MORT-PFPS (n = 20), and half will be assigned to treatment as&#xD;
      usual (TAU) (n = 20), to examine safety and effectiveness in individuals with patellofemoral&#xD;
      pain syndrome. All subjects will be followed up in the study for a total of 12 weeks, 8-week&#xD;
      courses of treatment with additional 4-week observation. The app provides multidisciplinary&#xD;
      rehabilitation treatment, a combination of graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavioural&#xD;
      therapy for patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome.&#xD;
