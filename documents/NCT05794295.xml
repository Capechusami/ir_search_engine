    <textblock>
      Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) patients and healthy controls will undergo a night of sleep at&#xD;
      the UC Davis Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) to characterize sleep architecture. A subset of&#xD;
      TLE patients will be randomly assigned to an Acoustic Stimulation (AS) or SHAM stimulation&#xD;
      night and return at least 7 days later for the other condition. Cognitive tests will be&#xD;
      conducted 90 minutes prior to sleep (learning and immediate recall) and again 1 hour after&#xD;
      awakening for 120 minutes (delayed recall and attention), while monitoring neural networks&#xD;
      using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) is characterized by disordered neural network activity and&#xD;
      temporal lobe onset seizures. Individuals with TLE experience debilitating diseases and&#xD;
      medical conditions including sleep disruption and cognitive deficits, which compromise daily&#xD;
      activity and quality of life. While these conditions can be long-term consequences of&#xD;
      repeated seizures and anti-seizure medications, research demonstrates that these conditions&#xD;
      can occur before the first recognized seizure and worsen over time, even with successful&#xD;
      seizure treatment. This suggests that early neural network abnormalities may underlie seizure&#xD;
      development while simultaneously impairing sleep and cognitive development, even prior to the&#xD;
      added effects of long term disease and treatments. Individuals with TLE experience sleep&#xD;
      disruption, which impairs memory consolidation and sustained attention, both of which are&#xD;
      compromised in TLE. A prominent, yet untested hypothesis is that TLE-related neural network&#xD;
      activity including interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) interrupt non-rapid eye movement&#xD;
      (NREM) sleep architecture, interfering with memory consolidation and attention. However,&#xD;
      specific mechanisms by which abnormal neural network activity contributes to disordered sleep&#xD;
      and cognition in TLE remain elusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot data demonstrate that new-onset TLE patients exhibit cognitive deficits that are linked&#xD;
      with reduced activation of key frontal-temporal neural networks, as measured by task-based&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which positively correlates with poor sleep.&#xD;
      These new and exciting findings suggest that characterizing the sleep architecture patterns&#xD;
      that contribute to less effective cognitive processing in TLE is critical to identifying&#xD;
      modifiable sleep biomarkers, and ultimately improving cognitive function in TLE patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will begin to address the existing gap in knowledge by investigating sleep&#xD;
      architecture patterns in TLE that directly contribute to cognitive deficits using both an&#xD;
      observational and a mechanism-probing interventional approach. In NREM sleep, slow wave&#xD;
      oscillations on electroencephalogram (EEG) are phase-locked and coupled with sleep spindle&#xD;
      oscillations (SW-SSO), which facilitates memory consolidation and potentially improves&#xD;
      attention. In TLE, disordered networks leading to IEDs and seizures may contribute to altered&#xD;
      SW-SSO coupling during sleep, resulting in memory and attention deficits. A single night of&#xD;
      acoustic stimulation (AS) has been demonstrated to improve cognitive performance and enhance&#xD;
      SW-SSO coupling in healthy adults, but has not been studied in TLE. The central hypothesis&#xD;
      for this study is that disordered networks in newly diagnosed TLE patients result in altered&#xD;
      sleep patterns, disrupting memory consolidation and attention. This study will test this&#xD;
      hypothesis by: (1) characterizing TLE sleep patterns using computational EEG - sleep spindle&#xD;
      density, slow wave power, IEDs, and SW-SSO coupling, (2) linking these TLE-related sleep&#xD;
      architecture alterations to cognitive processing; (3) determining if AS enhances SW-SSO&#xD;
      coupling in TLE; and (4) determining if AS improves memory and attention in young adults with&#xD;
      TLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, we will characterize sleep architecture patterns in TLE and determine the relationship&#xD;
      to cognitive processing. New-onset TLE patients and healthy controls will undergo one night&#xD;
      of scalp EEG-monitored sleep to characterize sleep spindle density, slow wave power, IEDs,&#xD;
      and SW-SSO coupling (i.e., phase-locking).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Compared to controls, TLE patients will exhibit IEDs as well as reduced sleep&#xD;
      spindle density and slow wave power with reduced SW-SSO coupling. The next morning, I will&#xD;
      use fMRI to monitor network activation as participants perform an attention task and&#xD;
      declarative memory recall, learned the night prior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Compared to controls, reduced SW-SSO coupling during sleep in TLE patients will&#xD;
      be associated with reduced activation on task-based fMRI, as well as poorer memory and&#xD;
      attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the study will determine the effect of AS on sleep architecture patterns and cognitive&#xD;
      processing in TLE. New-onset TLE patients will be randomly assigned to AS or SHAM stimulation&#xD;
      as the initial condition in a cross-over design and will undergo a night of scalp EEG&#xD;
      monitored sleep under each condition, separated by at least one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: AS will exhibit greater levels of SW-SSO coupling compared to SHAM. The next&#xD;
      morning, I will use fMRI to monitor network activation as participants perform an attention&#xD;
      task and declarative memory recall learned the night prior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Compared to SHAM, AS will show increased activation on task-based fMRI, and&#xD;
      improved memory and attention.&#xD;
