  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational study is to compare the differences in the features of&#xD;
      cerebral multifrequency EIT(cMFEIT) images between healthy subjects and patients with brain&#xD;
      diseases and to explore the possibility of applying multifrequency EIT to intracranial&#xD;
      abnormality detection.16 healthy volunteers and 8 patients with brain diseases were recruited&#xD;
      as experimental subjects, and the cerebral EIT data of 9 frequencies in the range of 21 kHz -&#xD;
      100 kHz of all subjects were acquired with an EH-300 MFEIT system.&#xD;

      For subjects who received clinical trials, 16 electrodes were placed equidistantly in their&#xD;
      head, and brain EIT data were measured at 9 frequencies in the range of 21 kHz to 100 kHz by&#xD;
      applying a current RMS of 176 microamps. The healthy group included 16 individuals (male, age&#xD;
      40.25±11.18). No history of brain disease and no abnormalities were seen on plain CT scans of&#xD;
      their brains. Cerebral EIT data collection from healthy volunteers was performed in a&#xD;
      dedicated laboratory with temperature controlled at 24±1 °C and 52%±1% humidity in 2022. The&#xD;
      subjects were lying in a horizontal position. The patient group included 8 patients with&#xD;
      brain diseases (7 males, age 59±10.46). Obvious lesions were visible on the patients' CT or&#xD;
      MRI images, including 6 patients with intracranial hemorrhage, 1 patient with cerebral&#xD;
      ischemia, and 1 patient with cerebral edema. Data from patients with brain diseases were&#xD;
      collected at the neurosurgical intensive care unit at the Army Medical Center of PLA in 2022.&#xD;
      The cerebral EIT data of the patients were collected in the same position as the healthy&#xD;
      individuals. The MFEIT image sequence is obtained according to a certain imaging algorithm,&#xD;
      and the ROI area ratio (AR_ROI) on the left and right sides of the image and the average&#xD;
      value of the reconstructed ROI resistivity change (MVRRC_ROI) are extracted. Based on the&#xD;
      extracted indicators, the geometric asymmetry index (GAI) and intensity asymmetry index (IAI)&#xD;
      was further proposed to characterize the symmetry of MFEIT images, and the differences&#xD;
      between the two groups of subjects on MFEIT images were statistically compared and analyzed.&#xD;
