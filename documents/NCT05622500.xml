    <textblock>
      Chronic obstruction of the iliac veins or inferior vena cava can occur as a result of deep&#xD;
      vein thrombosis (DVT), or due to extrinsic compression in non-thrombotic iliac vein lesions&#xD;
      (NIVLs). This obstruction can manifest as post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) after DVT or as&#xD;
      chronic venous disease (CVD) in NIVL. Despite sparse evidence, rates of venous stenting for&#xD;
      PTS and NIVLs are increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pragmatic, observer-blind, multi-centre, randomised-controlled trial for adults with CVD&#xD;
      secondary to either PTS or NIVLs randomised to either best endovenous therapy (including&#xD;
      venoplasty and deep venous stenting) or standard therapy (compression +/- anticoagulation).&#xD;
      Included participants will have chronic venous disease (CEAP classification 3 - 6) secondary&#xD;
      to proximal deep venous disease. The primary outcome is severity of venous disease at 6&#xD;
      months as ascertained by the Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Symptomatic chronic obstructive lesions of the iliac veins and inferior vein cava can be&#xD;
      secondary to post-thrombotic lesions caused by a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or due to&#xD;
      non-thrombotic iliac vein lesions (NIVLs). DVT has an annual incidence of 148 per 100,000&#xD;
      person years in Europe. Following a DVT, up to 50% of patients develop post thrombotic&#xD;
      syndrome (PTS), defined as &quot;chronic venous symptoms or signs secondary to DVT&quot; i.e. lifelong&#xD;
      leg pain, oedema and skin changes. Furthermore, the subsequent rate of venous ulceration is&#xD;
      high with up to 29% of those with PTS suffering from active or healed venous ulcers. The&#xD;
      pathophysiology of PTS is thought to be sustained venous hypertension from a combination of&#xD;
      venous outflow obstruction and valvular incompetence. NIVLs are due to external compression&#xD;
      or intrinsic lesions that reduce the venous drainage through the iliac venous system. This,&#xD;
      in turn, can lead to chronic venous insufficiency and also increase the risk of DVT. NIVLs&#xD;
      contribute to the significant morbidity and cost associated with CVD. NIVLs can be&#xD;
      demonstrated on imaging as a stenosed iliac vein or in an iliac vein of normal diameter with&#xD;
      intrinsic lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rates of venous stenting for PTS and NIVLs are rapidly increasing. However, sparse evidence&#xD;
      exists to support the use of venous stenting and clinical guidelines reflect this. Endovenous&#xD;
      stenting is being increasingly used as a treatment option for individuals with complications&#xD;
      relating to chronic venous disease such as skin changes, ulceration, debilitating symptoms,&#xD;
      and functional impairment. However, a recent systematic review of sixteen eligible studies,&#xD;
      none of which were RCTs, concluded that: &quot;The quality of evidence to support the use of deep&#xD;
      venous stenting to treat chronic obstructive disease is currently weak. The treatment does&#xD;
      however appear promising and is safe and should therefore be considered as a treatment option&#xD;
      while the evidence base is improved&quot;. Many of the studies employed stents which were not&#xD;
      primarily designed for use in the venous system. The role of endovenous reconstruction in the&#xD;
      context of patients with PTS and NIVLs, including deep venous stenting using modern stents&#xD;
      designed specifically for use in the venous system, remains to be elucidated in a&#xD;
      well-designed RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rational for the proposed study is supported by both haemodynamic and clinical evidence.&#xD;
      Retrospective cohorts of deep venous stenting in PTS and NIVLs have yielded promising&#xD;
      results. Pre-clinical research suggests that common femoral vein pressure is increased in&#xD;
      post thrombotic venous obstruction. It has been demonstrated that deep venous stenting&#xD;
      improves mean ambulatory venous pressures and therefore should reduce the symptomology&#xD;
      experienced by the individual. Furthermore, venous stents are specifically designed to be&#xD;
      uncovered and rigid, aiming to keep the aspect ratio of the stent at a 1:1 ratio, to minimise&#xD;
      outflow obstruction and increase venous return.&#xD;

    <description>Compression stockings encompass a range of therapies used to provide an externally applied graduated-pressure up the length of the limb aiming to improve venous function and decrease lower limb swelling. Compression stockings can be classified by size and grade, i.e. the pressure the stockings applies to the limb. For the purpose of this trial Class II and Class III graduated compression stockings should be used, with the aim of providing Class III if tolerated. Antithrombotic agents include, but are not limited to: warfarin (titrated to international normalised ratio, INR), apixaban, rivaroxaban, aspirin, and clopidogrel.</description>
