    <textblock>
      We propose hyperspectral imaging analysis as a method to identify the efficacy of&#xD;
      hormone-tacrolimus therapy for PMN, and to classify sensitive and insensitive patients&#xD;
      treated with hormone-tacrolimus regimen. A variety of machine learning models were used to&#xD;
      prove that hyperspectral imaging technology could assist patients in selecting the optimal&#xD;
      treatment plan, and further explore the predictive indicators of PMN treatment effect.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Renal biopsy slides of patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy diagnosed by renal&#xD;
      biopsy in our hospital from February 2016 to February 2022 were collected. ENVI Classic&#xD;
      software was used to process the hyperspectral images and delineate the region of interest.&#xD;
      The one-dimensional spectral data of each pixel in each region were derived. Machine learning&#xD;
      and deep learning methods were used to analyze the characteristics of hyperspectral data and&#xD;
      classify them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of the previous study came from the Department of Pathology and Nephrology of&#xD;
      Qianfoshan Hospital in Shandong Province. Under the light microscope, electron microscope and&#xD;
      immunofluorescence microscope, the pathological types of glomerular diseases in patients with&#xD;
      proteinuria were identified. By scanning the corresponding patient's H&amp;E stained pathological&#xD;
      sections, the hyperspectral microscopic images were classified by machine learning and deep&#xD;
      learning methods, and the classification accuracy was greater than 85%. It was concluded that&#xD;
      hyperspectral imaging technology can be used as a non-invasive diagnostic method to predict&#xD;
      treatment response.&#xD;
