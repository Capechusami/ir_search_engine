  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer worldwide and the leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer-related deaths. Despite recent advances in treatment, the five-year survival rate&#xD;
      remains below 25% [State of Lung Cancer Report 2021,American Lung Association. This is&#xD;
      largely due to the fact that most patients are diagnosed only at advanced stages of the&#xD;
      disease when treatments are ineffective and the prognosis is poor. The National Lung&#xD;
      Screening Trial demonstrated the utility of lung cancer screening by low-dose computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) to improve early detection\ and reduce lung cancer-related mortality by 20%.&#xD;
      Earlier detection of lung lesions in turn created an increased need for better early&#xD;
      diagnosis modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reveal Surgical is developing medical devices for tissue characterization based on Raman&#xD;
      spectroscopy technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proof-of-concept, ex vivo study, the study team will investigate whether Raman&#xD;
      spectroscopy technology is a good candidate for the identification of cancerous lung tissue.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 18 or above,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  With suspected or confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Scheduled for lobectomy surgery,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspected or confirmed diagnosis of mucinous adenocarcinoma of the lung&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. (This exclusion criterion is intended to minimize&#xD;
             confounding optical signals such as fluorescence or near-infrared Raman signals that&#xD;
             could arise from the presence of chromophores derived from neoadjuvant medication.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously diagnosed with cystic fibrosis or other lung disease, with the exception of&#xD;
             Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and ILD (Interstitial Lung Disease),&#xD;
             i.e., patients with COPD or ILD will not be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor size below 1cm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Resected lobe does not allow Surgical Pathology team to section two study specimens of&#xD;
             minimal size 1.5cm Ã— 1.5cm. In this case the patient will be found ineligible after&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
