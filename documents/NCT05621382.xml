      This study looks to compare pelvic misalignments of 30 subjects visualized before x-ray set&#xD;
      up to the actual misalignments derived from x-ray mensuration. 30 outpatients at the Sherman&#xD;
      College of Chiropractic Health Center were randomly chosen to participate, and were having&#xD;
      x-rays taken as part of their normal course of care in order prevent unnecessary radiation&#xD;
      exposure. Patients were told to march in place as they were positioned to the x-ray bucky.&#xD;
      Once the patient was set to the bucky, the bucky was moved out of the way and the patient was&#xD;
      visualized by a health center intern. The intern evaluated gluteal widths, gluteal fold&#xD;
      heights, and foot flare. The bucky was then replaced without patient movement and x-rays were&#xD;
      then taken. Two doctors with experience in Gonstead line analysis for the pelvis who were&#xD;
      blinded to the x-ray findings, measured pelvic misalignments and the results were compared to&#xD;
      the visual analysis.&#xD;
