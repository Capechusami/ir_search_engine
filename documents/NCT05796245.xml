      The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety of the safety of the study medicine&#xD;
      called infliximab for the possible treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      (UC, Crohn's disease, or psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RA is a kind of joint disease that causes pain and swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UC causes inflammation and sores (also called ulcers), in the lining of the rectum and colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chron's disease is a disease that lasts for a long time and causes severe irritation in your&#xD;
      digestive tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psoriasis is a skin disease that gives you a dry, scaly rash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes patient's data from the database who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have at least 90 days of look-back period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have any of these diseases (RA, UC, Crohn's disease, or Psoriasis) in the 90-day look&#xD;
           back period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are 15 years of age or older at the time of first dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patient's data included in this study would have received infliximab as intravenous&#xD;
      (into veins) injection.&#xD;

        The study population includes individuals who have a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
        ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or psoriasis and have been exposed to&#xD;
        Infliximab-Pfizer Biosimilar or the innovator (Remicade) with a planned study period&#xD;
        between December 1, 2018 and November 30, 2023.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have at least 90 days of look-back period&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have diagnostic code of indicated diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis,&#xD;
             Crohn's disease, or psoriasis) in the 90-day look-back period. Patients with &gt;1&#xD;
             indication will be summarized as a separate group from each sub-cohort. An inpatient&#xD;
             or outpatient visit assigned a diagnosis code consistent with either rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or psoriasis using ICD-10 coding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. 15 years of age or older at the time of index date&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with pre-existing safety outcome event during the 90-day look-back period will&#xD;
        be excluded from the study cohort for that specific outcome event as this study is&#xD;
        observing incident cases.&#xD;
