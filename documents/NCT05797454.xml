    <textblock>
      The standard method for localizing non-palpable breast cancer is currently preoperative&#xD;
      wire-guided localization, its positive margin rate still remains around 20-50%. This study&#xD;
      aims to compare the accuracy and efficacy of wire vs. combined breast tissue markers in&#xD;
      localizing non-palpable breast cancer.&#xD;
