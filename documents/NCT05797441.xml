    <textblock>
      Patients who complete prolonged exposure and cognitive processing therapy, the treatments for&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the most empirical support, continue to express a&#xD;
      need for mental health treatment. A therapist-assisted self-management program for patients&#xD;
      who have completed one of these two treatments and achieved symptom improvement has the&#xD;
      potential to meet patients' stated treatment needs, maintain or build upon their PTSD symptom&#xD;
      reductions, increase their confidence in managing their symptoms, and reduce the number of&#xD;
      mental health appointments that they need to attend. Further, reducing the number if mental&#xD;
      health sessions attended by completers of these time and resource intensive psychotherapies&#xD;
      will increase the likelihood that their implementation in regular-practice clinics will be&#xD;
      maintained.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background. Nearly 90% of Veterans who complete trauma-focused therapy (TFT) for PTSD have&#xD;
      remaining treatment needs. In the six-months following TFT, successful completers remain some&#xD;
      of the highest utilizers of VA mental health services despite clinically meaningful symptom&#xD;
      improvement. Prior work demonstrated that Veterans who benefitted from TFT's primary post-TFT&#xD;
      treatment needs were the practice and application of skills learned during therapy, with the&#xD;
      goal of maintaining or building upon treatment gains. Veterans expressed low self-efficacy&#xD;
      for meeting these goals without the support of their therapists and feared stagnation or&#xD;
      relapse without ongoing contact. As such, a therapist-assisted self-management program for&#xD;
      TFT completers (EMPOWER) designed as a step down from active psychotherapy was developed and&#xD;
      feasibility tested. The feasibility open trial demonstrated that EMPOWER is feasible and&#xD;
      highly acceptable to patients. Further, findings suggest that the intervention was successful&#xD;
      in helping Veterans maintain or enhance PTSD-related gains while reducing their mental health&#xD;
      service utilization. These promising findings warrant a randomized evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance. Interventions that meet Veterans' post-TFT treatment needs are urgently needed.&#xD;
      Mental health providers are delivering ongoing treatment to this high priority cohort of&#xD;
      Veterans without evidence to guide their treatment plan. Further, higher than expected levels&#xD;
      of post-TFT mental health care utilization threatens the continued implementation of these&#xD;
      highly effective treatments. For all Veterans to have access to the most effective treatments&#xD;
      for PTSD, interventions that prepare and enable successful TFT completers to step down from&#xD;
      active therapy must evaluated and implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation. The proposed study is the first large-scale study of post-TFT care and the first&#xD;
      to rigorously evaluate a self-management program to step-down from active to maintenance&#xD;
      mental health services following a course of active psychotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: 1) Estimate posterior probability distributions of EMPOWER's effects and&#xD;
      establish likely ranges for those effects as compared to post-TFT TAU for Veterans' MH&#xD;
      service utilization and self-reported PTSD symptoms. The subsequent Hybrid RCT will be&#xD;
      designed after assessing the likelihood of detecting an effect for EMPOWER across a range of&#xD;
      sample sizes using Go/No Go and Overall Power methods. 2) Explore the impact of EMPOWER&#xD;
      compared to post-TFT TAU on Veterans'(a) self-efficacy for managing PTSD symptoms, (b)&#xD;
      satisfaction with post-TFT care, (c) well-being &amp; functioning (d) depression, and (e)&#xD;
      secondary utilization outcomes. 3) Conduct semi-structured interviews with Veterans and&#xD;
      providers to contextualize quantitative findings and identify potential barriers,&#xD;
      facilitators, and strategies to facilitate future implementation of EMPOWER.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The study is a pragmatic randomized control trial (RCT) in which 36 PE and CPT&#xD;
      providers will be randomized to support Veterans as they participate in the EMPOWER&#xD;
      self-management program or facilitate TAU. Participants will be patients of the study&#xD;
      providers who recently completed a course of PE/CPT during which they experienced clinically&#xD;
      meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms (n=90). Primary outcomes will be mental health service&#xD;
      utilization (overall and with PE/CPT providers) and self-reported PTSD symptoms measured four&#xD;
      times over a 9-month period. Qualitative interviews with providers (n=18) and Veterans (n=24)&#xD;
      focused on providers' impressions of treatment effectiveness, implementation&#xD;
      challenges/potential strategies, and Veterans' perception of treatment effectiveness.&#xD;

In addition, there are 2 items that measure overall QOL and general health. Subscales (domains): Physical Health (7 items) Psychological Health (6 items) Social Relationships (3 items) Environment (8 items) Scoring: Items scored 1-5. Raw domain score is the sum of respective item scores. All domain scores are then normalized to a range of 0-100. Refer to user manual for scoring algorithm.</description>

    <description>The WBI is a multidimensional instrument that was designed to assess status, functioning, and satisfaction with four key life domains of vocation, finances, health, and social relationships. In total, there are 21 sections of the WBI and 126 questions/statements: 34 items for vocation, 24 for finances, 20 for health, and 48 for social relationships. Throughout the inventory, respondents are instructed to provide responses to categorical items (e.g., yes, no), or to endorse a single response from among statements using a 5-point Likert type response format (e.g., 1 = Never to 5 = Most or all of the time; 1 = Very dissatisfied to 5 = Very satisfied). Measures within each domain may be extracted from the full inventory and are available to use as separate entities depending on the needs of the administrator and/or the purpose of the assessment.</description>

    <measure>DSM-5 Cross-cutting symptom measure</measure>

    <description>This measure assesses comorbid mental health conditions. The CCSM consists of 23 questions in a self-report format that evaluates mental health domains that are significant across psychiatric diagnoses. It is quick and easy to administer, taking patients around 5 minutes to complete in the waiting room. There are 13 psychiatric domains in this measure: depression, anger, mania, anxiety, somatic symptoms, suicidal ideation, psychosis, sleep problems, memory, repetitive thoughts and behaviors, dissociation, personality functioning, and substance use. A 5-point scale (0-4) is used to record responses and reflect how much or how often the person has been concerned by a specific symptom over the previous 2 weeks. Additional inquiry is recommended if an individual scores a mild or slight rating, depending on the psychiatric symptom being investigated. This measure has good test-retest reliability in research settings and is useful and feasible in clinical practice.</description>
