  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, changes in knowledge and attitudes toward complementary and alternative&#xD;
      medicine have been occurring. One study shows that 21% of patients are turning to them. In&#xD;
      contrast, hypnosis is among the least used. While perceptions of alternative medicine are&#xD;
      improving, there is still widespread skepticism about the beliefs of hypnosis and this may&#xD;
      explain why patients are not turning to it. Although its use in oncology is no longer in&#xD;
      question, and its efficacy in the management of side effects has been demonstrated, no recent&#xD;
      qualitative study has been conducted to examine the representations of hypnosis among cancer&#xD;
      patients. It therefore seems relevant to us today to know the evolution of the&#xD;
      representations and attitudes of cancer patients towards hypnosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients experience psychological difficulties during the disease, associated with&#xD;
      treatment, and even in the post-treatment period. Among the most common, they mention&#xD;
      emotional distress, significant fatigue, sleep disturbance, or pain. Several authors agree&#xD;
      that there is a cluster of four core symptoms associated with the disease and its treatments,&#xD;
      including fatigue, nausea/vomiting, depression and pain. These symptoms have a significant&#xD;
      impact on daily activities, resulting in a decrease in quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reducing the symptoms of cancer to the sole etiology of the disease or its treatments does&#xD;
      not allow us to consider a management action. Indeed, patients with cancer face the diagnosis&#xD;
      and follow a course of care that includes many medical therapies (surgery, chemotherapy,&#xD;
      radiotherapy, etc.). Integrative medicine takes into account the need for these medical&#xD;
      therapies by adding the importance of supportive care for patients. Specifically, the&#xD;
      expected effects are to reduce the after-effects for people thanks to an offer of support&#xD;
      care adapted to their needs and regularly evaluated, ensuring a better quality of life&#xD;
      immediately and in the longer term, as well as by providing information that allows patients&#xD;
      to make the most informed choices possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity, dietary monitoring, and psychosocial interventions remain the most common&#xD;
      complementary therapies offered to patients to reduce treatment side effects. Among this wide&#xD;
      choice, patients can find themselves lost. Over the past decade, changes in knowledge and&#xD;
      attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine have been occurring. For example, one&#xD;
      study found that 21% of patients are turning to them, indicating a growing interest in this&#xD;
      type of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While perceptions of alternative medicine are improving, there is still widespread skepticism&#xD;
      about hypnosis. As a result, even though scientific research shows positive effects of this&#xD;
      type of therapy, a 2006 study in Canada found that out of 15 breast cancer patients using&#xD;
      psychosocial therapies, only 6% used hypnosis. Another study conducted in 2018 confirms these&#xD;
      results: on a population of 212 patients with different cancers, it appears that hypnosis is&#xD;
      the therapy least used and whose interest is lowest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have been conducted to determine the reasons for this lack of interest or the&#xD;
      beliefs that are associated with hypnosis. Existing research suggests that patients lack&#xD;
      information about hypnosis and its effectiveness, may have ambivalent perceptions about it or&#xD;
      be skeptical of its effectiveness, and that their beliefs may be influenced by the media.&#xD;
      Specifically, one study point out that positive attitudes toward hypnosis are even associated&#xD;
      with better hypnotic response. While its use in oncology is no longer in question, no recent&#xD;
      qualitative study has been conducted questioning the representations of hypnosis with cancer&#xD;
      patients. It therefore seems relevant to us today to know the evolution of the&#xD;
      representations and attitudes of cancer patients towards hypnosis. To do this, and according&#xD;
      to Leventhal's model of self-regulation, the information obtained by a patient, whether or&#xD;
      not it is medically based, is integrated by the patient in order to provide a &quot;lay&quot;&#xD;
      understanding of the subject in question. Activated representations may then be guided by the&#xD;
      individual's current and prior awareness or by social messages from perceived significant&#xD;
      others or authoritative sources and this impacts attitudes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to investigate psychosocial representations related to hypnosis in&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients and to assess the impact of these representations on the intention&#xD;
      to use hypnosis.&#xD;

    <description>The representations will be questioned in terms of identity, beliefs, consequences, temporality and controlability. Semi-structured interviews with qualitative analyses will be conducted to explore represenations in cancer patients. The five major questions as are follows : What is hypnosis/hypnotherapy for you ? What do you think about hypnosis ? If you were to turn to this technique, what would be your expectations ? At what point in your illness/treatment would hypnosis be most appropriate ? Do you think hypnosis can help you manage the symptoms of your illness or the side effects of treatment ?</description>
