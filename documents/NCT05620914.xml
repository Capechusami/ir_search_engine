      The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug, patritumab deruxtecan&#xD;
      (HER3-DXd), can be measured in brain tumor tissue after recieving one dose of patritumab&#xD;
      deruxtecan before surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This peri-operative window of opportunity study in patients with brain metastases will&#xD;
      provide a single dose of the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd,&#xD;
      formerly U3-1402) prior to craniotomy to investigate pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,&#xD;
      intra- and peritumoral immune activation and responses, safety and explore potential&#xD;
      biomarkers. This study will measure the level of the released payload DXd (MAAA-1181a) of&#xD;
      patritumab deruxtecan, in resected brain metastasis (BrM) tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a single dose of patritumab deruxtecan intravenously before surgery.&#xD;
      Patients will also have procedures such as medical history review, blood draws, MRI scans,&#xD;
      ECGs, and lumbar punctures. The amount of time patients are expected to be in this study is&#xD;
      approximately 40 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the risks of patritumab deruxtecan are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache,&#xD;
      interstitial lung disease, and low blood counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who are administered patritumab deruxtecan as part of this peri-operative&#xD;
      window of opportunity study will be included in analyses summarizing adverse events.&#xD;

             if: i) Hepatitis surface antigen (HBsAg) negative and hepatitis B core antibody&#xD;
             (anti-HBc) positive; OR ii) HBsAg positive and HBV DNA viral load is documented to be&#xD;
             ≤ 2000 IU/mL in the absence of anti-viral therapy and during the previous 12 weeks&#xD;
             prior to the viral load evaluation with normal transaminases (in the absence of liver&#xD;
             metastasis); OR iii) HBsAg positive and HBV DNA viral load is documented to be ≤ 2000&#xD;
             IU/mL in the absence of anti-viral therapy and during the previous 12 weeks prior to&#xD;
             the viral load evaluation with liver metastasis and abnormal transaminases AST/ALT &lt; 3&#xD;
             ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
             b) Participants with a history of Hepatitis C infection will be eligible for&#xD;
             enrollment only if the viral load according to local standards of detection, is&#xD;
             documented to be below the level of detection in the absence of anti-viral therapy&#xD;
             during the previous 12 weeks (ie, sustained viral response according to the local&#xD;
             product label but no less than 12 weeks, whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Prior or ongoing clinically relevant illness, medical condition, surgical history,&#xD;
             physical finding, or laboratory abnormality that, in the Investigator's judgment,&#xD;
             could affect the safety of the subject; alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism&#xD;
             or excretion of the study drug; or confound the assessment of study results&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Subjects with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Has known hypersensitivity to either the drug substance or inactive ingredients in the&#xD;
             drug product.&#xD;
