      CanTreatCOVID is an open-label, individually randomized, multi-centre, national trial.&#xD;
      CanTreatCOVID aims to establish an adaptive platform trial aimed at evaluating the clinical-&#xD;
      and cost-effectiveness, practical challenges, and outcomes of therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 for&#xD;
      non-hospitalized patients in Canada. Participants will be randomized to receive usual care&#xD;
      (i.e. supportive care and symptom relief) or a study therapeutic, which will be determined by&#xD;
      the Canadian COVID-19 Out-Patient Therapeutics Committee. The primary outcomes being&#xD;
      evaluated is hospitalization and/or death at 28 days, as well as time to recovery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While public health measures and vaccines have reduced the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on&#xD;
      hospitalization and death, most scientists predict this virus will become endemic and new&#xD;
      variants will continue to emerge. Effective and affordable therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 that&#xD;
      can be easily used in community settings are needed to accelerate recovery, prevent&#xD;
      hospitalizations and deaths, and to minimize the development of post-acute sequelae of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 (&quot;long COVID&quot;). Most randomized controlled trials (RCT) of therapeutics to date&#xD;
      have included participants who have not been vaccinated and who did not have previous&#xD;
      infections. The Canadian Adaptive Platform Trial of Treatments for COVID in Community&#xD;
      Settings (CanTreatCOVID) will evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 in non-hospitalized patients. Adaptive platform trials (APTs) are&#xD;
      designed to compare multiple therapies in an efficient manner and allow us to respond to the&#xD;
      dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therapeutics to be evaluated will be identified&#xD;
      through a transparent Canadian COVID-19 Out-Patient Therapeutics Committee. The co-primary&#xD;
      outcomes are all-cause hospitalization and/or death at 28 days as well as time to recovery,&#xD;
      and key secondary outcomes include, symptom severity, incidence of post-acute sequelae of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness of each therapeutic. CanTreatCOVID uses&#xD;
      numerous approaches to recruit participants to the study, including a multi-faceted public&#xD;
      communication strategy and outreach through primary care, out-patient clinics, and EDs.&#xD;
