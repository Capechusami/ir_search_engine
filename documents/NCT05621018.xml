  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eating Disorders (EDs) are mental disorders with long recovery time and high mortality.&#xD;
      Despite the importance and extensive research in the field, an effective treatment for EDs&#xD;
      has yet to be found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In co-production with ED patients, clinicians, and technology experts a Serious Game called&#xD;
      &quot;Maze out&quot; was developed and initially evaluated through a feasibility study. Maze out is an&#xD;
      innovative first player tool focusing on improving self-efficacy, mutual understanding, and&#xD;
      family functioning in adults with EDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The game has been evaluated through a usability study. Study findings demonstrate that&#xD;
      patients found Maze out easy to use, meaningful and fun.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usability study was thus a first step in developing and testing an evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention to be implemented in the treatment repertoire of adolescents and adults with&#xD;
      EDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a Randomized Controlled Trial, whereby the investigators will explore&#xD;
      the effectiveness of Maze out as an additional treatment to Treatment as Usual (TAU)&#xD;
