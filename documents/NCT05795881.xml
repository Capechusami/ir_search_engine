  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disruption of circadian rhythms is frequently observed in patients in the intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) and is associated with worse clinical outcomes. The ICU environment presents weak and&#xD;
      conflicting timing cues to the circadian clock, including continuous enteral nutrition. The&#xD;
      goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of timing of enteral nutrition on the&#xD;
      circadian rhythm in critically ill patients. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit&#xD;
      will be allocated to receive either continuous or cyclic daytime (8am to 8 pm) enteral&#xD;
      feeding. Differences in circadian rhythms will be assessed by 24h patterns in core body&#xD;
      temperature, heart rate variability, melatonin and peripheral clock gene expression.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include depth of sleep, glucose variability and incidence of feeding&#xD;
      intolerance. This study is expected to contribute to the optimalisation of circadian rhythms&#xD;
      in the ICU.&#xD;
