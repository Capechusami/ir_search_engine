  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred and fifty patients belonging to the American Society of Anesthesiologists&#xD;
      physical status 1 and 2, aged between 18 and 45 years and will be scheduled for emergency or&#xD;
      elective lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) under general anesthesia will be selected&#xD;
      between (December 2022 to March 2023, written informed consent will be obtained from all&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: ASA 1&amp; 2, Age between 18 and 45 years , scheduled for emergency or&#xD;
      elective CS under spinal anesthesia; While exclusion criteria:pregnant women who will refuse&#xD;
      to participate, known allergy to local anesthetic, infection at the block site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who will not willing to give consent, known allergy to local anesthetic or infection&#xD;
      at the block site will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive standard premedication according to institute protocol with&#xD;
      ranitidine and metoclopramide intravenously immediately before shifting the patient into the&#xD;
      operating room for emergency LSCS or 2 h before by oral route in case of elective LSCS.&#xD;
      Inside the operating room under all aseptic precautions, spinal anesthesia will be&#xD;
      administered using 1.8 ml of 0.5% of heavy bupivacaine without any adjuvant in L3-L4 space&#xD;
      using Quincke's needle by the attending anesthesiologist. The case will be managed by the&#xD;
      same person without any narcotics intraoperatively. At the end of the procedure just before&#xD;
      the skin closure, 1 g of injection paracetamol will be administered intravenously over a&#xD;
      period of 20 min as a part of multimodal analgesia. At the end of the surgery, patients will&#xD;
      be randomized into ILIH (50 patients) , TAP block group (35 patients) or quadratus lumborum&#xD;
      group (50 patients) by choosing a closed envelope, which will contain a standard data&#xD;
      collection sheet and an allocation card. All the blocks were performed by the principle&#xD;
      investigator under aseptic precautions and ultrasound guidance using high frequency linear&#xD;
      probe resonating at 12 MHz in the multi-beam mode. In TAP block group, the probe will be&#xD;
      placed perpendicular to the mid-axillary line between the iliac crest and the subcostal&#xD;
      margin and the three abdominal muscle layers will be identified, and the transverses&#xD;
      abdominis plane will be located between the internal oblique and the transverse abdominis&#xD;
      muscle. The TAP will be approached through in-plane technique using a 23-gauge Quincke spinal&#xD;
      needle attached to a 20 ml syringe of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected and the drug spread&#xD;
      in the plane will be observed. The same procedure will be repeated on the other side of the&#xD;
      abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ILIH group, the probe will be placed medial to the lateral one-third of the line joining&#xD;
      the umbilicus and the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), with part of the probe sitting on&#xD;
      the ASIS. The ASIS, iliacus muscle, internal oblique, transverses abdominis, and the ILIH&#xD;
      nerves between them will be identified. After appreciating the sonoanatomy, the ILIH nerve&#xD;
      will be approached with the 23-gauge Quincke spinal needle through in-plane technique and 10&#xD;
      ml of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected all around and the drug spread will be appreciated.&#xD;
      The same procedure will be repeated on the other side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the QLB, the transducer will be placed at the level of the anterosuperior iliac spine and&#xD;
      will move cranially until the 3 abdominal wall muscles will be clearly identified. The&#xD;
      external oblique muscle will be followed posterolaterally until its posterior border was&#xD;
      visualized (hook sign), leaving underneath the internal oblique muscle, like a roof over the&#xD;
      quadratus lumborum muscle. The probe will be tilted down to identify a bright hyperechoic&#xD;
      line that corresponded with the middle layer of he thoracolumbar fascia. The needle (21&#xD;
      gauge) will be inserted in plane from anterolateral to posteromedial. The optimal point of&#xD;
      injection for the QL block will be determined over the lumbar interfacial triangle using&#xD;
      hydrodissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure, patients will be shifted to the postanesthesia recovery room and&#xD;
      later to the postoperative ward after establishing the block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensory assessment following the TAP, ILIH, and QLB block will be done after confirming&#xD;
      the spinal regression below the level of L2 dermatome. The block will be considered&#xD;
      &quot;Successful&quot; when the patient will not be able to perceive the cold sensation at L1 dermatome&#xD;
      (inguinal region) on both sides. The block will be considered &quot;Partial&quot; when patient&#xD;
      perceives cold sensation on any one of the side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The block will be considered &quot;Failure&quot; when the patient perceives cold sensation on both&#xD;
      sides at L1 dermatome. Patients suffering partial and failed block will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study for further analysis but will receive standard postoperative analgesics as any other&#xD;
      patients. In the postoperative ward, whenever, the patient complained of pain, nurse&#xD;
      in-charge will note the numerical rating scale (NRS) score, and will administered a single&#xD;
      dose of injection diclofenac sodium of 50 mg as slow intravenous infusion over a period of 15&#xD;
      min and will note the time as time of first analgesia. Subsequently, whenever patient&#xD;
      complain of pain, injection tramadol 50 mg will be given intravenously for the remaining 24&#xD;
      h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blinded observer who will not be aware of the group allocation will visit the patient at 2,&#xD;
      4, 6, 10, 12, and 24 h postoperative intervals and analyz the study parameters and record in&#xD;
      the common standard data nalogue scale for pain (ranging from 0 to 10 with 0 no pain, 10&#xD;
      being severe pain, and the patients will be asked to mark the pain score on the scale) during&#xD;
      rest as well as on movement (turning lateral to any one side). Duration of analgesia will be&#xD;
      taken as time interval between the block time and the time of first analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 24 h requirement of rescue analgesics injection diclofenac sodium and injection tramadol&#xD;
      and complications such as nausea, vomiting, transient femoral nerve palsy, any signs, and&#xD;
      symptoms of bowel perforation will be noted.&#xD;
