  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Informal care is defined as the unpaid care provided to an older, frail, or ill person, by a&#xD;
      person such as a spouse, a parent, a child, another relative, a neighbor, or a friend. This&#xD;
      phenomenon may lead to stress, burden, and decreased informal caregivers' quality of life.&#xD;
      Since lack of time, distance from services, and financial strains make the provision of&#xD;
      psychological interventions to informal caregivers often challenging, Internet-based&#xD;
      (self-help) programs might represent a viable solution to promote their emotional well-being.&#xD;
      Still, despite the proven benefits of internet-based intervention, no available programs for&#xD;
      informal caregivers are available for the Italian population. Nevertheless, planning and&#xD;
      developing an online intervention, involving possible stakeholders (caregivers), might&#xD;
      facilitate the understanding and dissemination of, willingness to use, and success of the&#xD;
      future intervention. Thus, the goal of the current study is to assess Italian stakeholders'&#xD;
      knowledge about, awareness of, attitudes towards, willingness to participate and use, and&#xD;
      expected barriers to internet-based interventions.&#xD;

      The present study assessed the knowledge and awareness, attitudes, willingness to participate&#xD;
      in, and expected barriers towards using Internet-based interventions to alleviate caregivers'&#xD;
      burden in a sample of Italian caregivers and clinicians. To this aim, an online stakeholders'&#xD;
      survey was conducted in Italy among clinicians and informal caregivers, using a snowballing&#xD;
      sampling technique. Participants were asked to fill in the informed consent and complete the&#xD;
      online survey as a clinician, a caregiver, or both. Data were monitored daily. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics and Pearson correlation analysis were used for data analysis.&#xD;
