  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the effect of meal texture differences (slow vs fast eating rate) on intake&#xD;
      will be investigated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Food texture modifies eating rate and through that the energy intake of foods. It&#xD;
      is shown that harder, chunkier, more viscous, and more voluminous foods decrease eating rate&#xD;
      of foods and thus decrease energy intake. However, most research is done in model foods or&#xD;
      single foods. So far, little research on food texture and intake has been performed for&#xD;
      meals. It is not known what the effect of food texture and eating rate is on intake in a wide&#xD;
      variety of meals. Knowledge on the effect of food texture on intake could be used for&#xD;
      strategies to drive or limit energy intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective is to determine how a wide range of different food textures&#xD;
      influence energy intake, food intake, and eating behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: All participants receive all twelve different meals (within subject design).&#xD;
      The meals are either served during breakfast or lunch. The meals have a wide range of&#xD;
      different food textures. Participants consume the meals ad libitum twice per week for six&#xD;
      weeks long with at least two days in between.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy Dutch speaking adults (n=30) between 18-55 years old with a BMI&#xD;
      between 18.5-30 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants will join twelve test sessions. For the test sessions they will&#xD;
      visit the eating behaviour lab where they receive ad libitum meals during breakfast or lunch.&#xD;
      During meal consumption participants are video recorded to determine eating behaviour. The&#xD;
      participants will receive in total twelve meals. The order in which participants will receive&#xD;
      the meals will be block randomized (block n = 5).&#xD;
