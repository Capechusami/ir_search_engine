  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Safe walking needs the older adult to anticipate and respond quickly to external demands and&#xD;
      sudden environmental changes. The practice of complex and challenging situations of the usual&#xD;
      daily walking is very important to prevent balance loss and falls in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers reported that subjects trained in a virtual environment with enhanced feedback&#xD;
      performed walking skills better than those trained with conventional methods. The C-Mill&#xD;
      treadmill is an innovative device that was recently used for the training of impaired gait&#xD;
      and balance. C-Mill treadmill uses virtual reality, augmented feedback, and force plate&#xD;
      technology that provides the best solution for efficient functional movement therapy.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study will evaluate the efficacy of gait training with a virtual reality&#xD;
      treadmill on walking abilities in elderly people.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have shown that walking exercises effectively contribute to enhancing walking&#xD;
      performance in the elderly. Several studies have shown that treadmill training is effective&#xD;
      in improving the elderly person's ability to walk. Therefore, the practice of complex and&#xD;
      challenging situations of the usual daily walking is very important to improve walking.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, older adults have few opportunities to practice safe walking well and&#xD;
      consistently in a task-specific manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many studies that have shown that gait training in a challenging environment, such&#xD;
      as walking on a treadmill, is more effective in improving the elderly person's ability to&#xD;
      walk properly, compared to the traditional training exercise regimen that relies on training&#xD;
      in closed training environment free from challenges and obstacles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virtual reality technology is one of the advanced technologies used in physical therapy and&#xD;
      rehabilitation. This technology contributes to creating an interactive environment for the&#xD;
      trainees that enables them to integrate into the training process and encourages them to&#xD;
      perform controlled motor tasks. C-Mill treadmill applies a virtual reality environment,&#xD;
      dual-tasking exercises, obstacle avoidance games, and a variety of gait challenges in a safe&#xD;
      and controlled environment to increase walking adaptability and improve performance in&#xD;
      everyday life. Many studies found that the C-Mill treadmill is effective in improving gait&#xD;
      performance and adaptability in clinical practice Therefore, this study will compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of gait training with a virtual reality treadmill and the conventional physical&#xD;
      therapy program on walking abilities in elderly people.&#xD;

    <description>The Biodex Balance System will be used to assess the Change in the Overall Stability Indices of the Postural Stability Test. The test includes measurement of the following indices: overall stability index, anteroposterior index and mediolateral index which represents the children's ability to control their postural balance stability in all directions. High values % represent less stability and the children had difficulty in balance control. On the other hand lower values were indicative of a better balance control.</description>
