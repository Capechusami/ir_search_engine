  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to know the effects of an intervention in Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease symptoms. The main question it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is whole body vibration able to reduce rigidity in Parkinson's participants?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can whole body vibration modify gait abilities and other Parkinson's symptoms?&#xD;
           Participants (subjects with Parkinson's disease) will do habitual therapy treatment.&#xD;
           Experimental group will also carry out whole body vibration sessions and control group&#xD;
           will do placebo whole body vibration sessions.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes from baseline gait functionality at 9 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured with the Modified Emory Functional Ambulation Profile. This scale assesses functional ambulation in terms of assistance and time under five different environmental conditions.

    <description>Placebo whole body vibration will be administered with a vibration platform (Power Plate Move). Subjects will do several exercises (squats and steps) whilst on the platform. The platform will only be working for 3 seconds (parameters: frequency 30 Hz; amplitude: 2 mm) and after 3 seconds, the vibration will stop. Same as experimental group, there will be 1 min placebo activation; 1 min rest, 5 activations. 15 sessions will be carried out (2/week).</description>
