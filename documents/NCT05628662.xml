  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Achieving near-normoglycemia has been established as the main objective for most patients&#xD;
      with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, the so-called&#xD;
      artificial pancreas (AP) or closed-loop systems, may represent the ideal solution, especially&#xD;
      for patients not reaching the therapeutic goals with multiples doses of insulin or open-loop&#xD;
      delivery systems. Despite the advances in recent years that have proven the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of these devices in clinical trials and clinical practice settings, such evidence&#xD;
      cannot be extrapolated to highly unstable patients, as problematic hypoglycemia remains an&#xD;
      exclusion criterion in most of the trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SAFE-AP system is a single-hormone hybrid closed-loop controller based on a proportional&#xD;
      derivative with an insulin feedback controller that integrates a safety layer with&#xD;
      insulin-on-board constraints and sliding mode reference conditioning. The hybrid closed-loop&#xD;
      system includes a second safety feedback loop with a controller that triggers carbohydrate&#xD;
      recommendations to the patient. Both control loops are coordinated to ensure that the&#xD;
      counter-regulatory effect of rescue carbohydrates is not counteracted with insulin. Such&#xD;
      system has been previously proven effective in unannounced exercise, one of the main&#xD;
      challenges in AID systems development. Additionally, the algorithm has been recently tailored&#xD;
      to achieve a better control in the subgroup of T1D patients prone to hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this project, a rigorous clinical testing of the SAFE-AP system will be carried out in 12&#xD;
      patients with T1D and problematic hypoglycemia, despite treatment with continuous&#xD;
      subcutaneous insulin infusion. The safety and performance of the system will be evaluated in&#xD;
      a 32-hour pilot study, including 4 meals, one overnight period and 2 unannounced aerobic&#xD;
      exercise sessions. The study will be performed in a hospital setting with the on-site&#xD;
      supervision of a specialized nurse and a diabetologist, as well as an engineer in remote&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
