      This project aims to investigate the therapeutic and repair effects of cord blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells (MNCs) on bone marrow failure after chemotherapy in children with malignant diseases.&#xD;
      It is planned to collect 20 malignant children with bone marrow failure after chemotherapy&#xD;
      and randomly divide them into two groups. The umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells were&#xD;
      injected, ≥1×10^8 per infusion, once a week, and the recovery time of peripheral blood&#xD;
      leukocytes, neutrophils, platelets and hemoglobin was observed. According to the recovery of&#xD;
      myelosuppression, stop when the peripheral blood reaches leukocytes&gt;1×10^9/L,&#xD;
      neutrophils&gt;0.5×10^9/L, platelets&gt;25×10^9/L, and hemoglobin&gt;60g/L at the same time. Use,&#xD;
      share 1-4 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical software was used to compare the changes of peripheral blood leukocytes,&#xD;
      neutrophils, platelets and hemoglobin before the start of the test (0d) and 1d, 3d, 5d, 7d,&#xD;
      10d, and 14d after the start of the test, as well as the severity of concurrent infections&#xD;
      and antibiotic use Time, number of infusions of blood products.&#xD;

      The standard of bone marrow failure after chemotherapy is based on theWorld Health&#xD;
      Organization(WHO) grade IV myelosuppression standard, that is, peripheral blood white blood&#xD;
      cells (WBC) &lt; 1 × 10^9/L, neutrophils (N) &lt;0.5 × 10^9/L, platelets (PLT) &lt;25×10^9/L,&#xD;
      hemoglobin (Hb) &lt;60g/L, for more than 2 weeks. It is planned to collect 20 malignant children&#xD;
      with bone marrow failure after chemotherapy and randomly divide them into two groups. The&#xD;
      umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells were injected, ≥1×10^8 per infusion, once a week, and&#xD;
      the recovery time of peripheral blood leukocytes, neutrophils, platelets and hemoglobin was&#xD;
      observed. According to the recovery of myelosuppression, when the peripheral blood reaches&#xD;
      WBC&gt;1×10^9/L, N&gt;0.5×10^9/L, PLT&gt;25×10^9/L, and Hb&gt;60g/L at the same time, it should be&#xD;
      discontinued and used together. 1-4 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluation: Children under treatment who meet any one or more of the following, the&#xD;
      study will be terminated or withdrawn: (1) Within 6 hours after the treatment with venous&#xD;
      cord blood mononuclear cells, the clinical symptoms that cannot be explained by known causes&#xD;
      are significantly aggravated or In case of deterioration, the trial should be terminated, and&#xD;
      appropriate treatment should be carried out. The withdrawn cases should be included in the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy evaluation, and the count is invalid; (2) During the treatment and within 6&#xD;
      hours after the treatment, the following conditions that cannot be explained by the known&#xD;
      causes occur: severe hypotension, contraction Blood pressure drops ≥20mmHg or systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure &lt;70mmHg; severe hypertension, systolic blood pressure rises ≥20mmHg or systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure&gt;140mmHg, the test should be terminated; (3) During treatment and within 6&#xD;
      hours after treatment, chills, Patients with fever (body temperature ≥39°C), rash, headache,&#xD;
      low back pain and other symptoms should stop the test; (4) If serious adverse events occur,&#xD;
      the test should be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluation: compare the changes of peripheral blood leukocytes, neutrophils,&#xD;
      platelets and hemoglobin before the start of the test (0d) and 1d, 3d, 5d, 7d, 10d, and 14d&#xD;
      after the start of the test, as well as the severity of concurrent infection and antibiotic&#xD;
      use Time, number of infusions of blood products.&#xD;
