  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tis study aims to assess whether multiple sessions of sham-controlled HF-rTMS applied to the&#xD;
      motor cortex significantly reduces treatment-resistant neuropathic pain in diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also investigate the effect of those rTMS sessions on functional connectivity&#xD;
      of the M1 with brain areas involved in pain processing, underlying brain metabolism and brain&#xD;
      plasticity using rs-fMRI, MRS and Paired-pulse stimulation respectively in those patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized into two groups to receive real or sham rTMS protocol. A washout&#xD;
      period of at least 8 weeks will be respected between protocols to minimize carry-over&#xD;
      effects. Sham stimulation will be delivered using a sham coil, providing the same auditory&#xD;
      and sensory stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One daily rTMS session for 5 days of HF-rTMS, will be delivered through an H-coil applied to&#xD;
      the primary motor area of the leg. Each session will last 20 minutes during which 30&#xD;
      consecutive trains of 50 stimuli will be delivered at 20 Hz at 100% of resting motor&#xD;
      threshold (RMT), with an intertrain interval of 30s&#xD;

    <description>RAND 36-Item Health Survey; It is comprised of 36 items that assess eight health concepts: physical functioning, role limitations caused by physical health problems, role limitations caused by emotional problems, social functioning, emotional well-being, energy/fatigue, pain, and general health perceptions.&#xD;
Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. In step 2, items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores. A high score defines a more favorable health state.</description>
