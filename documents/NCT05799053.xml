  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peppermint oil has shown to be effective in the treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)&#xD;
      symptoms in adults. Few studies of low quality are performed in an paediatric setting.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators will conduct a multicenter randomized, placebo controlled trial&#xD;
      to investigate the effects of an eight-week peppermint oil treatment in paediatric IBS or&#xD;
      Functional Abdominal Pain - Not otherwise specified (FAP-NOS) patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the MINT study is to investigate the effectiveness of peppermint oil&#xD;
      capsules compared to placebo capsules in reducing abdominal pain intensity in children with&#xD;
      IBS or FAP-NOS. In addition, we evaluate the effect of peppermint oil capsules compared to&#xD;
      placebo capsules on other disease-related outcome measures such as anxiety &amp; depression,&#xD;
      quality of life, absenteeism from school, and healthcare costs. The second aim is to explore&#xD;
      the effectiveness of regular mints in reducing abdominal pain intensity compared to&#xD;
      peppermint oil capsules and placebo capsules and the effect of mints on secondary outcome&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;

    <measure>Abdominal pain intensity response rate after 8 weeks of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients with ≥ 30% reduction of their abdominal pain intensity after 8 weeks of therapy compared to baseline. This will be assessed by a smartphone diary app, on which patients record daily at the end of the day the intensity of their abdominal pain during a period of 7 consecutive days using a 10 point Likert scale/Wong-Baker faces scale. A score of 0 correlates with no pain and a score of 10 correlates with the worst imaginable pain. The intensity scores of 7 days will be summed up.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children aged between 8 years and 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of IBS or FAP-NOS according to the Rome IV criteria. According to these&#xD;
             criteria, organic disorders will be ruled out after routine laboratory testing&#xD;
             initiated by their general practitioner or treating physician as part of standard of&#xD;
             care. In patients without alarm symptoms only celiac screening (anti-transglutaminase&#xD;
             antibodies and IgA), and faecal calprotectin are necessary.37 In patients with&#xD;
             diarrhea faecal testing for Giardia Lambliae will be added. If alarm symptoms are&#xD;
             present, further diagnostic testing (like a full blood count, CRP, liver tests or an&#xD;
             ultrasound) to rule out an organic disorder, is left to the discretion of the treating&#xD;
             physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An average daily pain rate of ≥ 3 of 10 on the Wong Baker Faces Pain Scale (This is a&#xD;
             validated pain scale to measure pain intensity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Informed Consent by both parents and by children aged ≥ 12 years. No informed consent from&#xD;
        parents is necessary for children &gt;16 years.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current treatment by another health care professional for abdominal symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous use of peppermint oil for these abdominal complaints&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to mints or peppermint oil&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gastrointestinal blood loss&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recurrent or unexplained fevers&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Decreased growth velocity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of previous abdominal surgeries in the past 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant chronic health condition requiring specialty care (e.g., lithiasis,&#xD;
             ureteropelvic junction obstruction, sickle cell, cerebral palsy, hepatic,&#xD;
             hematopoietic, renal, endocrine, or metabolic diseases) that could potentially impact&#xD;
             the child's ability to participate or confound the results of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known concomitant organic gastrointestinal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of drugs which influence gastrointestinal motility, such as erythromycin,&#xD;
             azithromycin, butyl scopolamine, domperidone, mebeverine and Iberogast. If laxatives&#xD;
             are being used (in patients with IBS-C) they can continue using them during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of proton-pump inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or current lactation. Women with childbearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to first dose of study treatment&#xD;
