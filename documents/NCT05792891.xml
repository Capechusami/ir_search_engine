  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic started in December 2019 in Wuhan, the Chinese province of Hubei.&#xD;
      Compared to the period of the first epidemic wave (March to May 2020), in the period of the&#xD;
      second epidemic wave (October 2020 to July 2021), deceased people have a more significant&#xD;
      clinical complexit, as demonstrated by the higher number of comorbidities.The need to&#xD;
      allocate significant amounts of healthcare resources to the COVID-19 emergency, deferral of&#xD;
      routine healthcare visits, and invitation to avoid medical controls, if not strictly&#xD;
      necessary, may have led to interruptions of disease management undersupply of chronic&#xD;
      treatments. Consequently, the health status of patients with chronic pathologic conditions&#xD;
      have worsened during and beyond the crisis. Patients with cancer, autoimmune disease, and&#xD;
      immune deficiencies represented populations with varying immunocompetence, which made&#xD;
      translate into higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and, for this reason, we defined them as&#xD;
      frail populations.The main goal of the study was to propel the field of COVID-19 impact on&#xD;
      particularly vulnerable categories of patients. The findings of this study could aid in&#xD;
      determining the conditions under which healthcare organizations must operate in the event of&#xD;
      a pandemic in order to protect patient's rights to care.&#xD;

    <description>The study planned to collect demographic information, disease history, COVID-19 symptomatology, COVID-19 molecular test details, COVID-19 serological test results, and biobanking of biological specimens (PBMCs, sera, plasma). In addition, clinical analyses, anamnestic data, and pharmacological treatment pieces of information were collected.</description>
