      The study purpose is to examine the effects of breast tenderness relief intervention during&#xD;
      the late pregnancy on the parturients' breast engorgement, lactation, breastfeeding, maternal&#xD;
      competence, and stress.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal and child health is an important global health issue. Breast milk is the best food&#xD;
      for infants and has many benefits for both mothers and infants. However, the breastfeeding&#xD;
      rate in Taiwan has not increased but decreased in recent years. Breast engorgement and&#xD;
      hypogalactia often cause distress for many women, and lead to stress and abandonment of&#xD;
      breastfeeding, which in turn affects the achievement of motherhood. Therefore, nurses should&#xD;
      provide support interventions for parturients early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a two-years, prospective randomized controlled trial, and will adopt a&#xD;
      longitudinal repeated-measures design. Convenience sampling will be used to recruit 180&#xD;
      pregnancy and postpartum women in the obstetrics clinic and postpartum ward of a medical&#xD;
      center. The participants will be randomly assigned into two conditions (routine care and the&#xD;
      breast tenderness relief intervention condition). The intervention will be provided to the&#xD;
      participants from the 36th week of pregnancy until three months after delivery.&#xD;
      Questionnaires, and biological measurements will be used to collect data. The outcome&#xD;
      variables include the degree of breast engorgement, lactation, breastfeeding, maternal&#xD;
      competencies, and stress. In addition, those data will be collected at the 36th and 38th week&#xD;
      of pregnancy, three days, six weeks, and twelve weeks after childbirth. It is expected to&#xD;
      analyze the research results with generalized estimation equation method.&#xD;

    <description>When teaching pregnant women, the researchers will use tablet computers and models to explain the operation of breast combing and acupressure one-on-one, and use the model to demonstrate. Emphasis on breast grooming during pregnancy, twice a day, once in the morning and evening, 5 minutes on one breast each time, 10 minutes on both sides; strengthen breast grooming and acupressure after delivery. The first breast combing, 5 minutes on one breast each time, and 10 minutes on both sides 4 to 6 times a day. After combing, according to expert advice, massage the 6 acupoints around the breast for 5-10 seconds, and then use hand expressing or breastfeeding to discharge the milk .</description>
