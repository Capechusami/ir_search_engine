  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand variation in the symptoms of psoriasis and&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis using simple, scalable smartphone-based measurements. This study uses an&#xD;
      iPhone app to record these symptoms through questionnaires and sensors.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriatic disease exhibits a spectrum of symptoms and can transition from psoriasis (PsO),&#xD;
      largely affecting the skin, to psoriatic arthritis (PsA) involving widespread musculoskeletal&#xD;
      inflammation. Early detection of the PsO-to-PsA transition and rapid administration of&#xD;
      effective treatment is essential, as a delay in diagnosing PsA by as little as 6 months can&#xD;
      lead to irreversible joint damage. This &quot;ticking clock&quot; paradigm drives the need for frequent&#xD;
      monitoring and effective therapeutic intervention as early as possible to attenuate or&#xD;
      possibly prevent disease progression. Using a suite of smartphone-based measurements in an&#xD;
      app called Psorcast (psoriasis forecasts), we aim to aggregate weekly, symptom measurements&#xD;
      from participants in a remote, longitudinal observational study to map the trajectories of&#xD;
      treatment response and disease progression. In this study, we will explore measurements of&#xD;
      psoriatic disease activity at least an order of magnitude more frequently (weekly vs.&#xD;
      quarterly) than standard clinical practice or clinical trial designs. This study is not meant&#xD;
      to provide a medical diagnosis, treatment, or medical advice. It is meant to provide a&#xD;
      scalable, inexpensive, non-invasive and frequent measure and tracking of psoriasis and&#xD;
      psoriatic arthritis for research purposes.&#xD;
