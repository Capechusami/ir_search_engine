  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to examine the effectiveness of a multi-media experiential&#xD;
      training programme in advance care planning (ACP) for nursing staff in acute care settings.&#xD;
      The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  can the programme enhance nurses' decision-support skills&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  can the programme strengthen nurses' knowledge and confidence, and improve their&#xD;
           attitude toward ACP?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will compare the participants in the intervention group (receive training&#xD;
      programme) with those who are in the control group (receive no intervention) to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the programme.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study adopts a cluster randomised controlled trial with 12 weeks follow-up. A total of&#xD;
      234 eligible nurses working in 26 acute care hospital wards will be randomised at ward level&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio into either control or intervention arms. Guided by the Theory of Planned&#xD;
      Behaviour, we will conduct path analysis to assess the role of nurses' knowledge, attitudes&#xD;
      and confidence on the nurses' skill performance on decision support after the intervention.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>DSAT10 instrument is an observational feedback tool for evaluating decisional support interactions between health care workers and patients. The DSAT-10 includes 16 items divided into five domains of: Decision-Making Status; Knowledge of Options, Risks, and Benefits; Values Associated with Outcomes of Options. Scores range from zero to ten, with higher scores indicating more decisional support being verbalized during the patient-provider interaction.</description>

    <measure>Nurses' attitudes towards Advance Care Planning</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Nurses' attitudes towards ACP will be measured by nine five-point Likert scale items with 1=strongly disagree and 5= strongly agree. Higher scores indicate a more positive attitude. The scale was developed and validated by Putman-Casdorph et al . The nine items cover topics such as the perceived helpfulness of ACP, and worries about the legal consequences of limiting treatment.</description>
