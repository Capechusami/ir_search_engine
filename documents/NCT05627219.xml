  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial evaluates whether a network of peer genetic coaches is useful for addressing&#xD;
      disparities in genetic testing and screening among African American men with prostate cancer&#xD;
      that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body&#xD;
      (metastatic). While genetic testing has become central to prostate cancer care, African&#xD;
      American men are less likely seek testing due to lack of awareness, cultural beliefs,&#xD;
      financial limitations, fear of discrimination, and mistrust in the healthcare system. A&#xD;
      network of peer genetic coaches may help address barriers, beliefs, and needs of African&#xD;
      American men in the community and provide navigation to increase engagement in genetic&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Identify and train 6 African American (AA) men as peer genetic coaches (PGCs) for the&#xD;
      Extending Prostate Genetic Awareness, Navigation, and Delivery (EXPAND) Network. (Train peer&#xD;
      genetic coaches) II. Conduct a feasibility study of peer genetic coaching. (Provide&#xD;
      individual coaching)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Patient-related outcomes will include change in decisional conflict for genetic&#xD;
      counseling, acceptability/attitude toward genetic counseling and testing, and change of&#xD;
      genetics knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Peer genetic coaches undergo training and education on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Patients receive an educational booklet and attend a discussion with a peer genetic&#xD;
      coach on study.&#xD;
