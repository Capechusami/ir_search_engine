  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catequentinib (AL3818, Anlotinib) has been developed in a variety of clinical studies as&#xD;
      single agents or in combination with others. This trial is designed to offer patients who&#xD;
      completed an Advenchen sponsored AL3818 related study without progression the opportunity to&#xD;
      continue to receive this investigational product in this Post-Trial Access study (a&#xD;
      compassionate use trial), if the Investigator believes the patients can benefit from such a&#xD;
      treatment and the patients have signed the Informed Consent Form.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label trial and is designed to offer patients who are in a completed&#xD;
      Advenchen sponsored AL3818 study without progression the opportunity to continue to receive&#xD;
      AL3818. Qualified patients will continue therapy on their regimen established in the approved&#xD;
      parent AL3818 clinical study until disease progression, physician decision, patient&#xD;
      withdrawal, or sponsor discontinuation of the study. Dose modifications will be based on the&#xD;
      suggestions in the approved parent AL3818 clinical study. Patients may be required to come to&#xD;
      the site to receive AL3818. For patients who cannot come to the site to receive AL3818, the&#xD;
      Site may mail the drug to the patient. The exact dispersing methods will be based on the&#xD;
      Investigator's discretion.&#xD;

    <description>It inhibits VEGFR2-mediated downstream signal transduction, thereby inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. It also has high potency against FGFr as well as VEGFr, and as such acts as a mainly dual inhibitor.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be currently receiving treatment with AL3818 on a previously approved&#xD;
             parent protocol, including drug crossover patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have achieved stable disease, partial response or complete response&#xD;
             based on the most recent tumor assessment. If progressive disease on the most recent&#xD;
             tumor assessment, the Investigator believes the patient can clinically benefit from&#xD;
             continuing to receive AL3818.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential, and male partners must consent to use a&#xD;
             medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the study period and for 4&#xD;
             months after the last dose of either study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is willing and able to sign a new informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients for whom the Investigator believes can benefit from continuing to receive&#xD;
             AL3818&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has been discontinued from their previous AL3818 trial treatment greater than&#xD;
             3 weeks (one cycle) prior to entering the compassionate use trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient progressed while receiving therapy with AL3818 during their participation in&#xD;
             their immediate previous trial unless the Investigator believes the patient can&#xD;
             clinically benefit from continuing to receive AL3818.&#xD;
