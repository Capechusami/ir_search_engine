    <textblock>
      This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of palbociclib and&#xD;
      tazemetostat in combination with CPX-351 in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (AML) that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). CPX-351 is&#xD;
      a combination of the chemotherapy drugs, daunorubicin and cytarabine, which is the standard&#xD;
      of care for AML. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Palbociclib and tazemetostat are enzyme inhibitor drugs that are approved for&#xD;
      treating certain cancers but not AML. These drugs may stop the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving CPX-351 chemotherapy with enzyme&#xD;
      inhibitors palbociclib and tazemetostat may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      tazemetostat in combination with anthracycline-based chemotherapy following pre-treatment&#xD;
      with standard-dose palbociclib in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R)-acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of tazemetostat in combination with anthracycline&#xD;
      based chemotherapy following pre-treatment with standard-dose palbociclib in patients with&#xD;
      R/R-AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of tazemetostat in combination with anthracycline&#xD;
      based chemotherapy following pre-treatment with standard-dose palbociclib in patients with&#xD;
      R/R-AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether cell cycle re-entry of AML cells after palbociclib treatment&#xD;
      influences deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage and apoptosis induced by combining EZH2&#xD;
      inhibition with anthracycline-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tazemetostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive palbociclib and tazemetostat orally (PO) and liposome-encapsulated&#xD;
      daunorubicin-cytarabine (CPX-351) intravenously (IV) on study. Patients undergo bone marrow&#xD;
      aspiration and biopsy and blood sample collection during screening and on study.&#xD;
