    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single arm, open-label, extension study to evaluate the long-term&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of iptacopan in participants with aHUS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The extension study Baseline/Day 1 visit is equivalent to the End of Treatment visit of the&#xD;
      parent study. The study will begin on Day 1 followed by on-site visits every 4 months during&#xD;
      the study treatment period. A Safety Follow Up tele-visit must be conducted 7 days after last&#xD;
      study treatment to collect information on Adverse Events.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Throughout the study duration, up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) relapse is defined by the coexistence of at least two of the following at the same visit:&#xD;
thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 150 x 109 /L),&#xD;
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dl, LDH &gt; upper limit of normal, undetectable haptoglobin, presence of schistocyte on blood smear),&#xD;

    <time_frame>Throughout the study duration, up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Complete thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) Response is defined as (1) hematological normalization in platelet count (platelet count ≥150 x 109/L) and LDH (below ULN), and (2) improvement in kidney function (≥ 25% serum creatinine reduction from baseline or ≥ 25% serum creatinine reduction compared to serum creatinine values prior to initiation of anti-C5 antibody therapy)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout study duration, up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on eGFR categories will be collected.&#xD;
Serum creatinine as measured in mg/dL as part of the clinical chemistry panel through the central laboratory will be used to calculate the eGFR applying the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout study duration, up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage (1-5) based on eGFR categories will be provided:&#xD;
Stage 1 (G1): Kidney damage with normal kidney function&#xD;
Stage 2 (G2): Mild loss of kidney function&#xD;
Stage 3 (G3): 3a: Mild to moderate loss of kidney function; 3b: Moderate to severe loss of kidney function&#xD;
Stage 4 (G4): Severe loss of kidney function&#xD;
Stage 5 End stage renal disease (kidney failure): Kidney failure and need for transplant or dialysis</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants by dialysis requirement status</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study duration, up to 4 years</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) related adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout study duration, up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>TMA related events during the study defined as any of the following:&#xD;
Irreversible (&gt;3 months) reduction in eGFR rate by ≥20%, not attributable to another cause&#xD;
An episode of acute kidney injury (AKI) attributed to a TMA that requires renal replacement therapy&#xD;
A non-renal manifestation of a TMA that requires hospitalization, or causes irreversible organ damage or death.</description>
