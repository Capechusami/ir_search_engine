      Multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, A Phase II study of induction PD-1 blockade&#xD;
      (nivolumab) in patients with surgically completely resectable mismatch repair deficient&#xD;
      endometrial cancer. A total of 30 subjects from 7 institutions in Korea will be enrolled in&#xD;
      this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be administered Nivolumab 480mg intravenously every 4 weeks for a total 6&#xD;
      cycles. After the 6 cycles of anti-cancer therapy, surgical resection will be performed. If&#xD;
      clinical and pathological complete response is confirmed, it is possible to observe the&#xD;
      patient's progress without surgical treatment.&#xD;

             repeated within 7 days before the first dose of the investigational product, and these&#xD;
             latest laboratory tests must meet the following criteria. Of note, laboratory data&#xD;
             will not be valid if the patient has received a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  White blood cells ≥2,000/mm3 and neutrophils ≥1,500/mm3&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Women of childbearing potential (including women with chemical menopause or no&#xD;
             menstruation for other medical reasons)#1 must agree to use contraception#2 from the&#xD;
             time of informed consent until 5months or more after the last dose of the&#xD;
             investigational product. Also, women must agree not to breastfeed from the time of&#xD;
             informed consent until 5 months or more after the last dose of the investigational&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of childbearing potential are defined as all women after the onset of&#xD;
                  menstruation who are not postmenopausal and have not been surgically sterilized&#xD;
                  (e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy).&#xD;
                  Post-menopause is defined as amenorrhea for ≥12 consecutive months without&#xD;
                  specific reasons. Women using oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, or&#xD;
                  mechanical contraception such as contraceptive barriers are regarded as having&#xD;
                  childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The subject must consent to use any one of the following methods of&#xD;
                  contraception: a condom for the subject's partner (male), an intrauterine device&#xD;

                  highly effective only if it is defined as abstaining from sexual intercourse with&#xD;
                  the opposite sex for the entire duration of the trial treatment-related risks.&#xD;
                  The reliability of sexual abstinence in relation to the duration of the trial&#xD;
                  needs to be evaluated, and sexual abstinence should be a preferred and routine&#xD;
                  lifestyle of the subjects.&#xD;
