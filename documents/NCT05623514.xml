      Vaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (vNOTES) is an emerging field in&#xD;
      minimally invasive surgery. International consensus-based statement was recently published to&#xD;
      help guide the basis for adopting vNOTES into clinical practice, including regarding patient&#xD;
      selection. It was agreed that women with potential adhesions are not appropriate candidates&#xD;
      for vNOTES approach including women with suspected adhesions due to history of severe pelvic&#xD;
      inflammatory disease (PID) or endometriosis. However, as some pelvic infections might be&#xD;
      asymptomatic, pre-operation imaging might be beneficial to complete improved selection of&#xD;
      patients. Moreover, women with previous severe PID or endometriosis might still have&#xD;
      favorable pelvic to perform the vNOTES approach. Therefore, we aim to compare pre-operation&#xD;
      ultrasound evaluation to operative characteristics and outcomes in women undergoing VNOTES&#xD;
      approach surgery.&#xD;

      Vaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (vNOTES) is an emerging field in&#xD;
      minimally invasive surgery. It has gained the most popularity compared to other transluminal&#xD;
      natural orifices such as mouth, rectum or urinary tract. By incorporating the advantages of&#xD;
      endoscopic surgery, the vNOTES approach avoids abdominal wall wounds and trocar-related&#xD;
      complications. Recent studies report reduced postoperative pain, accelerated postoperative&#xD;
      recovery, and decreased postoperative wound infections, as well as achieving highly&#xD;
      satisfying cosmetic results. All these made this technique very appealing to surgeons and&#xD;
      patients alike.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility and safety of vNOTES in gynecologic surgeries, was first introduced by Ahn et&#xD;
      al. in 2012 that performed vNOTES in ten women with benign uterine adnexal disease. Since&#xD;
      then, surgeons have developed the technique in various benign gynecologic surgeries&#xD;
      indications. There has been an exponential uptake of the number of surgeons performing vNOTES&#xD;
      procedures worldwide with no official guidance to ensure the safe implementation of this&#xD;
      technique into gynecological practice. The novelty of the technique is still a matter of&#xD;
      concern in sub-populations and different indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International consensus-based statement was recently published based on Delphi consensus of&#xD;
      expert panel to help guide the basis for adopting vNOTES into clinical practice with respect&#xD;
      to eight key domains including patient selection. It was agreed that women with potential&#xD;
      adhesions are not appropriate candidates for vNOTES approach including women with a history&#xD;
      of a severe PID that is considered contraindication. 97.4% of the experts agreed that it is&#xD;
      not necessary to perform a preoperative vaginal culture if the patient is asymptomatic.&#xD;
      However, as some pelvic infections might be asymptomatic such as with chlamydia,&#xD;
      pre-operation imaging might be beneficial to complete proper patient selection for the vNOTES&#xD;
      approach. Moreover, women with previous severe PID infection might still have favorable&#xD;
      pelvic to perform the vNOTES approach Aim: To the best of our knowledge no guidelines have&#xD;
      been published regarding the pre-operation evaluation and the imaging characteristics. Due to&#xD;
      the aforementioned, the aim of our study is to compare pre-operation ultrasound evaluation to&#xD;
      operative characteristics and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods This is a prospective cohort study that will be conducted in a single&#xD;
      tertiary medical center. Study population will include all women planned for surgery due to&#xD;
      benign indication (adnexectomy/ hysterectomy) that vNOTES approach is considered and have&#xD;
      normal vaginal examination (normal mobility of the uterus). Women with history of pelvic&#xD;
      radiation, suspected malignancy or combined operations will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. As part of the evaluation at the pre-operation clinics, women will complete vaginal&#xD;
           examination to assess for pelvic organs mobility and potential adhesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Trans-vaginal examination will be completed to evaluate uterus and adnexal&#xD;
           characteristics in addition to sliding sign between the uterus to the rectum for the&#xD;
           evaluation of the Douglas space.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Women with normal ultrasound evaluation and a positive sliding sign will continue with&#xD;
           surgery via the vNOTES approach. Women with limited mobility demonstrated on ultrasound&#xD;
           will be recommended alternative surgical approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-Swabs will be collected for potential PID pathogens including chlamydia, gonorrhea,&#xD;
      trichomonas and mycoplasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4-Operation report- will include information regarding pelvic adhesions, location of the&#xD;
      adhesions and abdominal screening (Including diaphragm and liver area). For the study group&#xD;
      undergoing vNOTES approach surgery - difficulty to complete anterior or posterior colpotomy&#xD;
      will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Douglas space characteristics of the patients undergoing vNOTES approach surgery will be&#xD;
      compared to patients that were ruled from vNOTES approach in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      association of the presence or absence of sliding sign on pre operation ultrasound to the&#xD;
      clinical findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical characteristics will be collected from women's medical files.&#xD;
      Operative and post-operative data will be collected including: operation duration, estimated&#xD;
      blood loss, operation complications (hypotension, bladder gut or vascular perforation),&#xD;
      post-operative complications (hemorrhage, endometritis, vascular - thromboembolic event,&#xD;
      ileus).&#xD;
