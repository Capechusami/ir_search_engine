      gender minority youth (GMY; children, adolescents, and young adults whose gender is different&#xD;

      The overall goal of the larger 3-aim study is to develop and pilot test a training&#xD;
      intervention to increase mental health providers' use of gender-affirming practices with&#xD;
      gender minority youth (GMY; children, adolescents, and young adults whose gender is different&#xD;
      from their birth-assigned sex). The Boston College Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved&#xD;
      protocol #21.247.01-15. Aim 1 involved designing the training intervention through an&#xD;
      extensive literature review and community-engaged methods that centered on collaborations&#xD;
      with providers, GMY, and caregivers. Aim 2 (in progress) entails refining the training&#xD;
      intervention via human centered design methods. Aim 3 (registered here) of the study is an&#xD;
      open trial pilot study at a multi-clinic mental health agency, aimed at examining the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of conducting a future randomized controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
      Effectiveness and implementation data from both providers (n=49) and clients (i.e., GMY and&#xD;
      their caregivers; n=50 GMY and n=30 caregivers) will be collected and analyzed. Primary&#xD;
      outcomes are measured at the provider-level and secondary outcomes are measured at the&#xD;
      patient-level (i.e., GMY and their caregivers).&#xD;
