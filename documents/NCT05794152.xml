  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Wenzhou Gestational Diabetes Cohort (WGDC) is a prospective cohort study among women with&#xD;
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy and their offspring living in Wenzhou,&#xD;
      China. The primary aim of this cohort is to characterize the continuous blood glucose&#xD;
      response to dietary intake and physical activity among pregnant women with GDM over 2 weeks,&#xD;
      and to facilitate the development of personalized nutritional/lifestyle recommendation among&#xD;
      these patients. Another aim of the WGDC is to investigate the association of dietary and&#xD;
      physical activity together with continuous glucose change during pregnancy on the adverse&#xD;
      birth outcomes including preterm birth, macrosomia and large-for-gestational-age birth. The&#xD;
      secondary aim is to investigate the prospective associations of diet, physical activity and&#xD;
      continuous glucose change over 2 weeks among the patients with long-term metabolic health of&#xD;
      the women and their offspring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In China, an alarming increase in the prevalence of GDM has been observed in the past decade.&#xD;
      GDM is of concern because it is associated with several maternal and fetal medical disorders.&#xD;
      Lifestyle changes such as diet and physical activity modifications are key for the prevention&#xD;
      and treatment of GDM. However, the associations between dietary intake and physical activity&#xD;
      and health outcomes for GDM women and their children remain unclear due to subjective&#xD;
      measurements of diet and physical activity. Recently, the development of objective&#xD;
      measurements such as food image identification and wearable activity trackers give an&#xD;
      opportunity to gain more precise insight into these associations. In addition, for the same&#xD;
      food and physical activity exposure, GDM women may have different blood glucose responses,&#xD;
      but the nature of variation is currently poorly characterized. Therefore, the present WGDC&#xD;
      design incorporates three unique components, 1) objective measurement of physical activity&#xD;
      during pregnancy using accelerometer; 2) measurement of dietary intake using both Food&#xD;
      Frequency Questionnaire and daily dietary records; 3) measurement of blood glucose levels&#xD;
      over 2 weeks using continuous glucose monitors, with three standardized test meals during the&#xD;
      2 weeks. We will then follow up these women participants during and after this pregnancy, and&#xD;
      also follow up their offspring.&#xD;
