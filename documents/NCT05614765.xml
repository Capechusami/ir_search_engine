  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a large-scale, prospective, multi-site, and non-interventional observational&#xD;
      study to observe the change and safety of dyslipidemia management status when administering&#xD;
      statin+etimib complex drugs in patients with dyslipidemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All treatments, including drug administration and laboratory tests performed after&#xD;
      administration of statin+etimib complex, are performed by the researcher's medical judgment&#xD;
      regardless of the subject's participation in the study, and the information to be confirmed&#xD;
      in this observational study is collected up to 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will begin after the date of signing the research contract, and the follow-up&#xD;
      period for each study subject is from the registration date (Visit 1) to the 24th week (Visit&#xD;
      3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate subjects' clinical performance in real world, we collect demographic information&#xD;
      and medical treatment based on patient's medical records, previous dyslipidemia drug&#xD;
      administration information, blood lipid tests and liver function tests conducted at the start&#xD;
      date of statin+etimib compound administration and subsequent 24 weeks (Â± 8 weeks). In the&#xD;
      case of safety-related information, such as abnormal cases, data shall be collected at any&#xD;
      time during the 24-week follow-up period if there is a visit by the study subject according&#xD;
      to daily treatment.&#xD;

        clinical trial results of the test subjects with similar underlying diseases that can be&#xD;
