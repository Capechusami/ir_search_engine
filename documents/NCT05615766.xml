  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation robotics has the potential to facilitate rehabilitation at home and empower&#xD;
      people with spinal injuries to self-manage increasing their independence and improving their&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to assess for the first time in the NHS the efficacy of a&#xD;
      commercial robotic orthosis for upper limb rehabilitation in patients with spinal cord&#xD;
      injury. The device is produced by Myomo (myomo.com) which is an American company. We will be&#xD;
      assessing the wearable robotic orthosis also known as robotic exoskeleton in two different&#xD;
      neuro-rehabilitation centres: National Spinal injuries Unit in Glasgow (Scotland) and The&#xD;
      Robert Jones and Agnus Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in Oswestry (England). The study will&#xD;
      involve nine spinal cord injured tetraplegic inpatients in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will follow a twelve-week rehabilitation programme with three to four sessions per&#xD;
      week in addition to their usual care and rehabilitation. Each session lasts for approximately&#xD;
      45 minutes. Participants arm function, range of motion, spasticity level will be measured&#xD;
      before, half-way and at the end of the programme to assess change in these and other&#xD;
      parameters. Training will focus on the dominant arm of the patient and compared to the other&#xD;
      arm at every assessment stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We shall evaluate therapists' and patients' satisfaction with the commercial device in&#xD;
      addition to assessing various clinical measures to evaluate the efficacy of using the robotic&#xD;
      orthosis in rehabilitation and recovery of arm function.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18+ years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The levels of C5 C6 Asia C/D would provide individuals with elbow and hand impairment&#xD;
             and potentially functional shoulder movements. C7, C8 individuals could also benefit&#xD;
             from the hand component of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Some gross shoulder movement at start of the trial to enable changes at the&#xD;
             elbow/hand, to have the greatest potential for functional change.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preservation of hand sensation as base for motor restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Some sitting balance would give the best opportunity for the arm to be released for&#xD;
             functional upper limb activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EMG (muscle activity) evidence of active finger flexion, extension and elbow flexion&#xD;
             extension Grade 1-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minimal or No community functional use of upper limb at start of trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Spasticity MAS 1-3/5.&#xD;
