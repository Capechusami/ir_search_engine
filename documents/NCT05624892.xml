    <textblock>
      : Aim: Stroke is increasing day by day in our country as in the world. Early rehabilitation&#xD;
      after stroke accelerates motor-sensory gains of individuals. This also increases the quality&#xD;
      of life. Although there are studies on post-stroke rehabilitation in our country,&#xD;
      rehabilitation applications with virtual reality application are very limited. For this&#xD;
      reason, the research was carried out to determine the effect of home therapy with virtual&#xD;
      reality application on motor-sensory gains and quality of life after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and method: The research was conducted as a randomized controlled experimental&#xD;
      study. The universe of the research; Between December 2021 and May 2022, individuals who met&#xD;
      the criteria for inclusion in the study who applied for home care to Erzurum Atat√ºrk&#xD;
      University Health Application and Research Center Physical Therapy Unit with the diagnosis of&#xD;
      loss of movement in the upper extremity after stroke were formed. The sample size for the&#xD;
      research was determined by power analysis. In the power analysis, it was determined that a&#xD;
      total of 52 people should be reached in order to reach the 95% confidence level at the 0.05&#xD;
      significance level and 80% power at the p&lt;0.05 significance level. Considering that there may&#xD;
      be data losses in the study, it was decided to reach 60 people, 15% more than the sample.&#xD;
      &quot;Descriptive Feature Form&quot;, &quot;Brunnstrom Staging&quot; and &quot;SF-36 Quality of Life Scale&quot; were used&#xD;
      to collect data.In the analysis of data; percentile distribution, chi-square, Fisher-Freeman-&#xD;
      Halton Exact test, t-test in independent groups, Repeated Measures ANOVA Test, Friedman Test,&#xD;
      One Way ANOVA test, Kruskall Wallis test, and post hoc analyzes (Bonferroni, Games Howell,&#xD;
      Dunn) were used.&#xD;

    <description>Individuals in the experimental and control groups were evaluated with the &quot;Brunnstrom Staging&quot; and the &quot;SF-36 Quality of Life Scale&quot;. The Brunnstrom Staging&quot; and the &quot;SF-36 Quality of Life Scale consists of 8 sub-dimensions. It is expected that the average score will increase in all sub-dimensions of the scale. Higher scores indicate that physical function, social functionality, mental health, energy/vitality and general health sub-dimensions increase. Similarly, higher scores indicate a decrease in physical role difficulty, emotional role difficulty and pain.</description>

    <description>The final test for individuals in the experimental and control groups were evaluated with the &quot;Brunnstrom Staging&quot; and the &quot;SF-36 Quality of Life Scale&quot;. The experimental group received mirror therapy with virtual reality application, and the control group had classical mirror therapy. The Brunnstrom Staging&quot; and the &quot;SF-36 Quality of Life Scale consists of 8 sub-dimensions. It is expected that the average score will increase in all sub-dimensions of the scale. Higher scores indicate that physical function, social functionality, mental health, energy/vitality and general health sub-dimensions increase.
