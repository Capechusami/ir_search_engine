  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for Giant Cell arteritis (GCA) is Glucocorticoids(GC), even if&#xD;
      GC-related adverse events are commonly occuring. Therefore, other practises for reducing&#xD;
      relapses and cumulative GC-doses are needed. Currently, the Interleukin-6-inhibitor&#xD;
      tocilizumab is used in combination with GC to achieve higher remission rates and lower&#xD;
      cumulative GC-doses. The use of tocilizumab also has some disadvantages. One is the increased&#xD;
      susceptibility to infections. On top of that, a long-term follow-up of the phase II study by&#xD;
      Villiger et al. showed a 55% relapse-rate after discontinuation of intravenous tocilizumab&#xD;
      after a median of five months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have also shown that methotrexate(MTX) in combination with GC was able to prevent&#xD;
      relapses and reduce cumulative GC doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate whether MTX is superior to placebo to prevent relapses in&#xD;
      subjects with GCA after Remission-Induction Therapy with Glucocorticoids and Tocilizumab. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that Methotrexate can maintain remission, once stable remission has been&#xD;
      induced by GC and Tocilizumab and will prevent the occurrence of relapses.&#xD;
