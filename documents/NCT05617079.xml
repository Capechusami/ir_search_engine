  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that the inhalation (nebulizer) use of drugs is of great importance in the&#xD;
      intensive care of patients with acute and chronic respiratory failure of various origins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Searching PubMed data for the last 5 years (2017-2022) for the keywords &quot;nebulizer therapy&quot;&#xD;
      revealed 533 publications, and &quot;mesh nebulizer therapy&quot; - only 25 sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the same period, the national database (E-Library) has 75 publications for the&#xD;
      keywords &quot;nebulizer therapy&quot;, and 4 sources for &quot;mesh nebulizer therapy&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that almost all publications are devoted to the use of nebulizers for&#xD;
      specific diseases and pathological syndromes. There are no works evaluating the adherence of&#xD;
      specialists, systemic indications and actually used methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of trial is to study the current state of the use of nebulizer therapy in medical&#xD;
      organizations and identify ways to improve its effectiveness This study is planned to be&#xD;
      carried out using a questionnaire using a database based on the Internet electronic survey&#xD;
      form.&#xD;
