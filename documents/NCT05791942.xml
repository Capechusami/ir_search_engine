  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized clinical trial evaluating how behaviorally-informed outreach&#xD;
      text message reminders impact patient engagement with primary care. This prospective&#xD;
      randomized control trial is being implemented in conjunction with UCLA Health's larger&#xD;
      quality improvement initiative (the My Action Plan Quality Improvement Initiative) in order&#xD;
      to improve primary care preventive measure completion rates.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UCLA Health will launch an initiative called My Action Plan which is an outreach effort&#xD;
      targeting the primary care patients at UCLA who have an outstanding, clinically indicated&#xD;
      primary care preventative care gap (e.g., overdue colorectal cancer screening, outstanding&#xD;
      diabetes tests) and aims at encouraging patients to complete their overdue health maintenance&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of each month, identified UCLA Health primary care patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      in a trial the investigators have pre-registered under the title &quot;UCLA Health Patient Health&#xD;
      Maintenance Outreach Text Message&quot; and randomized to receive one of four text messages&#xD;
      informing them that they have overdue health maintenance measures and urging them to take&#xD;
      action to complete these measures. These text messages will contain a link to their MyChart&#xD;
      patient portal account, specifically linking them to a My Action Plan electronic letter that&#xD;
      will contain a personalized list of outstanding preventive care items and actionable steps to&#xD;
      complete the items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In March and April 2023, if participants do not open their My Action Plan electronic letter&#xD;
      within 7 days after the initial outreach, they will be enrolled in the trial described in the&#xD;
      current pre-registration. This trial will evaluate the effect of sending a text reminder&#xD;
      about health gaps as well as compare the effectiveness of different outreach text reminders.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to either the holdout control condition&#xD;
      (without a reminder) or one of the three reminder arms (receiving one of three text reminders&#xD;
      2 weeks after the initial outreach message). Additionally, within each text-reminder arm,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to one of three time slots for getting the reminder. The&#xD;
      investigators will examine patients' interaction with these reminders and how that ultimately&#xD;
      translates to them completing their indicated health maintenance measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UCLA Department of Medicine (DOM) intends to roll out this QI initiative at the beginning&#xD;
      of the 2023 calendar year and continue it for a span of at least 12 months. Each month, the&#xD;
      initiative targets patients whose birthday falls into that month. This proposed trial will&#xD;
      run for two months (March and April 2023).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will utilize patient-level ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation, with&#xD;
      statistical inferences based on model-robust standard errors. The primary model term will be&#xD;
      indicator variables for arm assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will adjust for sex, age, race/ethnicity, indicators for screenings/tests that&#xD;
      patients are due for, and whether patients have upcoming primary care appointments. Missing&#xD;
      covariate values will be handled by including 'unknown' indicators, along with mean&#xD;
      imputation for quantitative covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use this dataset to address two separate research questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question 1: The investigators will compare the average of Arms 2-4 with Arm 1 to&#xD;
      test the average effect of sending a text reminder. If the average effect is significant, the&#xD;
      investigators will explore if Arms 2, 3, and 4 separately differ from Arm 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question 2: The investigators will compare Arm 3, Arm 4, with Arm 2 to test whether,&#xD;
      compared to a simple (control) reminder, it is more effective to boost patients' intentions&#xD;
      to close the health gap via an anecdote or to prompt patients to take actions quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses will investigate heterogeneous treatment effects by patients' baseline&#xD;
      motivation (i.e., the extent to which patients seem to have some intentions to get the&#xD;
      screenings/tests) in two ways. First, the investigators will use each patient's history of&#xD;
      screenings/tests to construct a proxy for their baseline motivation to obtain the due&#xD;
      screenings/tests. Specifically, the investigator will calculate, among all the&#xD;
      screenings/tests that are included in the My Action Plan Initiative and that a patient was&#xD;
      due for in the past few years (exact time window TBD based on data availability), what&#xD;
      percentage was completed by the patient (as far as UCLA Health could tell). A higher&#xD;
      percentage indicates a higher baseline motivation to get the screenings/tests patients are&#xD;
      due for during the study period. Second, the investigators will obtain demographics and&#xD;
      medical information that UCLA Health is willing to provide (e.g., gender, age,&#xD;
      race/ethnicity, history of cancer and other pre-existing conditions, family cancer history,&#xD;
      past adherence to screenings/tests that are included in the My Action Plan Initiative, past&#xD;
      receipt of influenza vaccination, frequency of doctor visits; time window of these variables&#xD;
      is TBD depending on data availability). With such information, the investigators will train&#xD;
      an algorithm to predict patients' baseline motivation level using patients in the holdout&#xD;
      condition (Arm 1) as the ground truth. Specifically, the investigators will take the&#xD;
      aforementioned information about patients in Arm 1 as input, and use whether they complete&#xD;
      any of the screenings/visits recommended in the My Action Plan letter within 6 months as the&#xD;
      outcome measure. Then the investigators will apply the algorithm to all patients to predict&#xD;
      their baseline motivation level. For both approaches, the proxy for baseline motivation&#xD;
      (Approach 1) and the predicted baseline motivation level (Approach 2) will be used to analyze&#xD;
      the heterogeneous treatment effects of (1) Arms 3 and 4 (vs. Arm 2) and (2) the combination&#xD;
      of Arms 2 and 4 vs. Arm 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally the investigators will investigate proxies for whether patients face structural&#xD;
      barriers to get screenings/tests as moderators, including socioeconomic factors at the&#xD;
      zipcode level, insurance type, proxies for accessibility to healthcare resources such as&#xD;
      distance from UCLA Health clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also explore how the effect of text reminders varies across the three&#xD;
      times of the day when the reminders will be sent.&#xD;
