  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed to test effects of a single session of meditative movement (Tai&#xD;
      Chi Easy) on older adults' blood pressure, perceptions of connection, mood, and oxytocin&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endogenous oxytocin (the &quot;cuddle hormone&quot;) is associated with lowering blood pressure (BP),&#xD;
      suggesting that finding ways to increase oxytocin even in the absence of social connection,&#xD;
      may be beneficial. Meditative movement emphasizing breath, meditative state and flow-inducing&#xD;
      movements holds potential for reducing BP, improving mood and releasing oxytocin. In a&#xD;
      single-group pilot study we exposed 21 OAs with mild-moderate hypertension to a 50-minute&#xD;
      &quot;Tai Chi Easy (TCE)&quot; (simplified Tai Chi/Qigong) session, collecting BP, saliva samples for&#xD;
      oxytocin, and psychosocial measures (connection, mood) pre/post intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Profile of Mood States; Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from pre-intervention mood to immediately post-50-minute intervention point</time_frame>
    <description>Using only subscales for depression and tension, 14 items with response format 0-4, reporting mean of responses, range 0-4 with higher scores indicating higher levels of depression and tension.</description>

    <measure>Change in perception of Connection (this is not a published scale, no formal name, created for this study)</measure>

    <measure>The De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-intervention only</time_frame>
    <description>6 items each scored either 0 (not at all) 1 (somewhat lonely) or 2 (more lonely), score is computed as a mean across items, range 0-6 with higher scores indicating more loneliness</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Flow State Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Used to assess perceptions of the experience of flow while performing the Tai Chi Easy intervention. 36 items, Score range 36-80, high scores indicate greater sense of flow.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Meditative Movement Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Scales that assess the experience of meditative state and breath focus during intervention, 11 items, score range 11-66 (or reported as a mean of the scores on the scale, then 1-6 range), with higher numbers indicating less breath focus and meditative state.</description>
