  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to analyze the effect of N-Acetylcysteine administration&#xD;
      towards blood oxidant level, transaminase enzyme, and bilirubin level in ALL children who&#xD;
      undergo induction phase of chemotherapy. The main question it aims to answer is whether&#xD;
      N-Acetylcysteine can decrease oxidative stress level and reduce hepatotoxicity complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated for MDA level, transaminase enzymes and bilirubin level&#xD;
      before, during, and after the chemotherapy. Participants will be given capsules containing&#xD;
      600mg of N-Acetylcysteine as adjunctive treatment during the 6 weeks induction phase of&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will compare the lab results to the placebo group to see if there is any&#xD;
      significant difference in the results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study has been designed as a randomized single-blind placebo-controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. Sample size calculation for the study was 18 newly diagnosed ALL children in each&#xD;
      group using the numerical unpaired two groups data analysis formula. Subjects were recruited&#xD;
      from newly diagnosed children with ALL and will start the induction phase of chemotherapy&#xD;
      both in hospital ward and outpatient clinic in the Child Health Department at Cipto&#xD;
      Mangunkusumo Hospital from August to December 2020. Subjects' parents received an explanation&#xD;
      about the study, including the objective and benefits of the study, and also the procedure&#xD;
      which will be held. Parents were then asked about the willingness to join the study and&#xD;
      signed the form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were randomized consecutively and distributed into two groups. Randomization was&#xD;
      done by a third person to decide the distribution of the subjects based on the serial number&#xD;
      of randomization. Subjects in treatment group will be given capsules containing 600 mg of NAC&#xD;
      and subjects in the control group will be given capsules containing placebo (lactose) as the&#xD;
      adjunctive treatment during the 6 week induction phase of chemotherapy. Both of the medicines&#xD;
      were prepared by the Installation of Pharmacy in Cipto Mangunkusumo National Hospital with&#xD;
      the same type and same color of capsules. NAC will be administered during the induction phase&#xD;
      of chemotherapy starting in the first week until 6 weeks. This study will analyze change of&#xD;
      MDA levels, transaminase enzyme levels, and bilirubin levels before and after the 6th week of&#xD;
      the induction phase of chemotherapy.&#xD;
