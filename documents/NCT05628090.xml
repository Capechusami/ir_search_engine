    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyze data from an existing database named SAATH-7 Star, in&#xD;
      order to assess the treatment persistence to basal insulin in Type 2 diabetes patients who&#xD;
      had been enrolled in the SAATH-7 Star structured patient education program in India.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective study will involve secondary analysis of already existing data of Indian&#xD;
      T2DM patients who were administered subcutaneous injectable solutions of insulin glargine&#xD;
      (Lantus® or Toujeo®), as per routine clinical practice and who were enrolled in a structured&#xD;
      educational program named SAATH-7 Star. Six-months data for eligible patients, who were&#xD;
      enrolled in the SAATH-7 Star Program during the index period of March 2019-August 2019,&#xD;
      collected from the SAATH-7 Star database will be analyzed for the defined objectives. The&#xD;
      index date is defined as the date of enrollment in SAATH-7 Star program i.e. 1st month, which&#xD;
      will also be considered as the 'Baseline'&#xD;
