      Specific study objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe patient and provider characteristics for aflibercept patients and&#xD;
           aflibercept user injections by aflibercept dispensing device, overall, and stratified by&#xD;
           time (quarterly, annually).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the annual and quarterly incidence of intraocular inflammation (IOI) and&#xD;
           suspected endophthalmitis for aflibercept user injections by aflibercept dispensing&#xD;
           device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To estimate the annual incidence of IOI and suspected endophthalmitis for aflibercept user&#xD;
      injections by dispensing device, stratified by indication for use, history of IOI, and&#xD;
      provider characteristics.&#xD;

        The study period will span from 01 Jan 2014 (earliest complete data available) to 28 May&#xD;
        2022 (or most current data available). The study will include patients ≥18 years of age in&#xD;
        Vestrum who have received one or more injections of aflibercept, regardless of indication,&#xD;
        between 01 Jan 2014 to 30 Apr 2022 (one month look forward required). Patients must have at&#xD;
        least one eligible treatment episode (defined as aflibercept injection followed by 28-day&#xD;
        exposed period after injection) to be included in the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria for a Treatment Episode:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Must have received one or more injections of aflibercept, regardless of indication,&#xD;
             between 01Jan2014 to 30Apr2022&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have at least one eligible treatment episode a. Specification of&#xD;
             laterality of aflibercept injection (left or right eye or both) for treatment episode&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for a Treatment Episode:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A post-operative follow-up visit for any ocular surgery (excluding vitrectomy), within&#xD;
             +/-28 days of aflibercept injection, as defined in the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Active steroid treatment, defined as steroid treatment (topical or intravitreal) on&#xD;
             the date of aflibercept injection. This criterion is limited to date of aflibercept&#xD;
             injection since steroids may be used to treat IOIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any treatment episode where a patient eye receives &gt;1 (or an unknown) anti-VEGF&#xD;
             injection on the index date (date of aflibercept injection).&#xD;
