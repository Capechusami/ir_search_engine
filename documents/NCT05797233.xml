      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 23,000 people die from B-cell cancers in the US each year. These cancers, often called&#xD;
      leukemia or lymphoma, affect a type of white blood cell called B cells. These cancers are&#xD;
      difficult to treat, and the therapies used can have bad side effects. Researchers want to try&#xD;
      a new type of treatment. This new treatment uses a patient s own immune cells (T cells) that&#xD;
      are modified to carry genes (chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR T cells) to kill cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test a treatment using CAR T cells in people with B-cell cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People aged 18 to 75 years with a B-cell cancer that has not been controlled with standard&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened. They will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A needle will be inserted to draw a sample of tissue from inside the hip bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For some patients, a needle will be inserted into their lower back to get a sample of the&#xD;
      fluid around their spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tumor biopsy might be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests of their heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo apheresis: Blood will be drawn from a needle in an arm. The blood&#xD;
      will pass through a machine that separates out the T cells. The remaining blood will be&#xD;
      returned to the body through a second needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive 2 chemotherapy drugs once a day for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the hospital for at least 9 days. Their T cells, now&#xD;
      modified, will be infused back into their bloodstream through a tube placed in a large vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will continue for 5 years, but patients will need to stay in touch with the&#xD;
      CAR treatment team for 15 year.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improved treatments for a variety of treatment-resistant malignancies including B-cell&#xD;
           lymphomas, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A particular need is development of new treatments for chemotherapy-refractory B- cell&#xD;
           malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T- cells can be genetically modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that&#xD;
           specifically target malignancy-associated antigens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autologous T- cells genetically modified to express CARs targeting the B-cell antigen&#xD;
           CD19 have caused complete remissions in patients with leukemia or lymphoma. These&#xD;
           results have established anti-CD19 CAR T- cells as an important therapy for relapsed&#xD;
           lymphoma, but only about 40% of patients receiving anti-CD19 CAR T- cells have durable&#xD;
           complete remissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Most B-cell malignancies express CD19 and CD20, but expression of CD19 and CD20 can be&#xD;
           lost or diminished.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD19 and CD20 are not expressed by normal cells except for B cells and some plasma&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We have constructed a novel gene therapy construct that encodes a fully-human anti- CD19&#xD;
           CAR with a CD28 domain and a fully-human anti-CD20 CAR with a 4-1BB domain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T -cells expressing this CAR construct, called Hu1928-Hu20BB-Long, can specifically&#xD;
           recognize CD19 and CD20-expressing target cells in vitro and eradicate CD19 or&#xD;
           CD20-expressing tumors in mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One CAR expressed in this CAR construct, Hu19-CD828Z has been tested in humans before.&#xD;
           The other CAR in the total construct, Hu20-CD8BBZ-Long, has not been tested in humans&#xD;
           before.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible toxicities include cytokine-associated toxicities such as fever, hypotension,&#xD;
           and neurological toxicities. Elimination of normal B cells is probable, and unknown&#xD;
           toxicities are also possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Determine the safety of administering T-cells expressing a novel fully-human anti- CD19 and&#xD;
      anti-CD20 CAR construct to participant with advanced B-cell malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant must have any B-cell lymphoma, or CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), or&#xD;
           Gray-zone lymphoma. Lower grade lymphomas transformed to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
           (DLBCL) are potentially eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt;= 18 years of age and &lt;=75 years of age at time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant must have malignancy that is measurable on a CT scan or by flow cytometry of&#xD;
           bone marrow or blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant must have a creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL or less and a normal cardiac ejection&#xD;
           fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An ECOG performance status of 0-1 is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No active infections are allowed including hepatitis B or hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;=1000/microL, platelet count &gt;=50,000/microL, hemoglobin&#xD;
           &gt;=8g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum ALT and AST less or equal to 3 times the upper limit of the institutional normal&#xD;
           unless liver involvement by malignancy is demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 14 days must elapse between the time of any prior systemic treatment (including&#xD;
           corticosteroids) and protocol-required leukapheresis or CAR T-cell infusion. In&#xD;
           addition, sixty days must elapse from therapy with antibodies targeting CD19 or CD20 and&#xD;
           CAR T-cell infusion, and at least 180 days must elapse since any prior CAR T-cell&#xD;
           therapy or checkpoint therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant s malignancy will need to be assessed for CD19 and C20 expression by&#xD;
           flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry performed at the NIH. If unstained, paraffin-&#xD;
           embedded bone marrow or lymphoma tissue sections are available from prior biopsies,&#xD;
           these can be used to determine CD19 and CD20 expression by immunohistochemistry;&#xD;
           otherwise, Participant will need to come to the NIH for a biopsy to determine CD19 and&#xD;
           CD20 expression. The sample for CD19 and CD20 expression must come from a biopsy&#xD;
           obtained after any CD19 or CD20-targeted therapies such as monoclonal antibodies if such&#xD;
           antibodies or CAR T-cell therapies have been received by the Participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Either CD19 or CD20 expression must be uniform . Uniform CD19 or CD20 expression is&#xD;
           defined as no obvious lymphoma population lacking antigen expression can be present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase I dose-escalation trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T-cells obtained by leukapheresis will be genetically modified to express the Hu1928-&#xD;
           Hu20BB-Long CAR construct.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive a lymphocyte-depleting chemotherapy conditioning regimen with&#xD;
           the intent of enhancing the activity of the infused CAR-expressing T- cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The chemotherapy conditioning regimen is cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m^2 daily for 3 days&#xD;
           and fludarabine 30 mg/m^2 daily for 3 days. Fludarabine will be given on the same days&#xD;
           as the cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three days after the chemotherapy ends, participants will receive an infusion of anti-&#xD;
           CAR- expressing T- cells .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The initial dose level of this dose-escalation trial will be 0.66x10^6 CAR+ T- cells/kg&#xD;
           of recipient bodyweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cell dose administered will be escalated until a maximum tolerated dose is&#xD;
           determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following the T-cell infusion, there is a mandatory 9-day inpatient hospitalization to&#xD;
           monitor for toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outpatient follow-up is planned for 2 weeks, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months after&#xD;
           the CAR T-cell infusion; less frequent follow-up is required more than 1 year after&#xD;
           infusion. Long-term gene-therapy follow-up for a total of 15 years after infusion is&#xD;
           required.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD19 and or CD20 expression is required. For all lymphoma types, eligibility criteria&#xD;
             are met if there is uniform expression of both CD19 and CD20. Eligibility criteria are&#xD;
             also met with expression of either CD19 or CD20. CD19 and/or CD20 expression must be&#xD;
             &quot;uniform&quot;. &quot;Uniform&quot; CD19 or CD20 expression is defined by CD19 and/or CD20 antigen&#xD;
             expression on lymphoma cells with no obvious lymphoma population lacking antigen&#xD;
             expression. Antigen expression can be assessed by either immunohistochemistry or flow&#xD;
             cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathology confirmed B-cell malignancy. Only when insufficient biopsy material is&#xD;
             available to allow CD19 and CD20 expression assessment at the NIH, CD19 and/or CD20&#xD;
             staining performed at another institution can be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 14 days must elapse between the time of any prior systemic treatment&#xD;

             previously treated with at least 2 regimens including exposure to a monoclonal&#xD;
             antibody, a bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and cytotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with mantle cell lymphoma are eligible after receiving a Bruton tyrosine&#xD;
             kinase (BTK) inhibitor, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, and at least one of the&#xD;

             therapy at least 1 of which must have contained cytotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary central nervous system lymphoma patients are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants must have measurable malignancy as defined by at least one of the criteria&#xD;
        below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Lymphoma or leukemia masses that are measurable (minimum 1.5 cm in largest diameter) by&#xD;

        with malignancy is detected. All masses must be less than or equal to&#xD;
&#xD;
        10.0 cm in the largest diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For a lymphoma mass to count as measurable malignancy, it must have abnormally&#xD;
             increased metabolic activity when assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) scan.&#xD;
             Exceptions to this rule are malignancies that do not consistently display increased&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  For CLL and lymphoma with only bone marrow and/or blood involvement no mass is&#xD;
             necessary, but if a mass is not present, bone marrow and/or blood malignancy must be&#xD;
             detectable by flow cytometry. Note that leukemia cells must make up 1% or less of&#xD;
             peripheral blood lymphocytes within 2 weeks of the time of protocol enrollment in CLL&#xD;
             participants for CLL participants to be eligible.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants must be tested for the presence of Hepatitis C antigen by PCR and be HCV&#xD;
             RNA negative in order to be eligible. Only if Hepatitis C PCR testing is not available&#xD;

             ventricular fibrillation, active cardiac arrhythmias (active atrial fibrillation is&#xD;
             not allowed, resolved atrial fibrillation not requiring current treatment is allowed&#xD;
             (anticoagulants count as current treatment), active obstructive or restrictive&#xD;
             pulmonary disease, active autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant neurologic disorders that are not completely and permanently resolved and&#xD;
             not requiring current treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency&#xD;
             Disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
