    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if adult patients with IBS-C will report an overall&#xD;
      greater improvement in IBS symptoms and quality of life when treated with a combination of&#xD;
      linaclotide (standard of care medication) and immersive virtual reality (VR) therapy compared&#xD;
      to those treated with linaclotide and sham (placebo) VR therapy.&#xD;

      The primary aim of this study will be to assess the benefits of disease-targeted VR combined&#xD;
      with linaclotide, compared to sham VR combined with linaclotide, in patients with IBS-C as&#xD;
      defined by Rome IV criteria. The investigators hypothesize that compared to patients&#xD;
      receiving sham VR and linaclotide, IBS-C patients receiving combination therapy with active&#xD;
      VR and linaclotide will achieve statistically significant and clinically meaningful&#xD;
      improvements in disease-targeted health-related quality of life while demonstrating&#xD;
      improvements in global IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate changes in quality of life using the validated IBS-QoL (primary outcome);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate global improvement in IBS symptoms using the validated IBS-SSS;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess global improvement in IBS symptoms using the validated Abdominal Scoring system&#xD;
           (11);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate improvement in abdominal pain using a numerical rating system (NRS);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assess improvement in constipation using the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS);&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Evaluate response to bloating using the validated Mayo bloating questionnaire (12);&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Assess response to coexisting psychological distress using the validated HADs&#xD;
           questionnaire;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Evaluate changes in work productivity using the validated WPAI.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult men and women (18-70) who meet Rome IV criteria for IBS-C. Patients will be&#xD;
             required to score below 65 points on the IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QOL) instrument,&#xD;
             indicating a score consistent with at least moderate HRQOL impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded from the study if they have a comorbid disorder that may&#xD;
             confound the diagnosis of IBS, including celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease,&#xD;
             autoimmune disorders that affect the GI system, history of bowel resection, HIV/AIDS,&#xD;
             diabetes with HgA1c &gt;7.0, neuroendocrine tumors, microscopic colitis, lactase&#xD;
             deficiency, eosinophilic bowel disease, acute intermittent porphyria, or any other&#xD;
             condition that a licensed physician believes can mimic IBS symptoms and undermine&#xD;
             diagnostic certitude. Patients with severe depression, defined as a score equal to or&#xD;
             greater than two standard deviations (SDs) on the NIH PROMIS depression scale, or&#xD;
             those with suicidal ideations, will also be excluded and provided with standard&#xD;
             resources to support their mental health and referred back to their primary care&#xD;
             provider, a member of the study team will follow up with the PCP to ensure the&#xD;
             communication was received.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients using regular doses of opioid medications will also be excluded given the&#xD;
        often-severe impact of opioids on GI motility and potential for pharmacological visceral&#xD;
        hyperalgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will also be excluded from the study if they do not meet Rome IV criteria for&#xD;
        IBS-C, have a known seizure disorder, if symptoms are thought to represent an organic&#xD;
        disorder, if they have had prior surgery to the colon, if symptoms represent a known pelvic&#xD;
        floor disorder, if the patient is abusing alcohol, or if the patient cannot actively&#xD;
        participate in the study for any other reason (e.g., inability to understand English as the&#xD;
        VR program is in English only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients previously treated with linaclotide who reported side effects, those currently on&#xD;
        linaclotide (any dose), and those who did not note an improvement in IBS-C symptoms in the&#xD;
        past while on linaclotide will also be excluded.&#xD;
