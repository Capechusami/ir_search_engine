  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The need for neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the delivery room is rare with less&#xD;
      than 1% of newborns requiring advanced resuscitation. The use of clinical decision support&#xD;
      tools to guide practitioners on medical procedure steps is recognized by the medical&#xD;
      community. In this randomized bi-centric controlled study, we investigate the effect of a&#xD;
      mobile phone application on technical and non-technical performance of student trinomials&#xD;
      managing simulated critical neonatal events&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The need for neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the delivery room is rare with less&#xD;
      than 1% of newborns requiring advanced resuscitation: Approximately 85% of babies born at&#xD;
      term will initiate breathing spontaneously at birth. An additional 10% will do so in response&#xD;
      to stimulation and drying. However, approximately 5% of term infants receive&#xD;
      positive-pressure ventilation to successfully transition, 2% are intubated, 0.1% receive&#xD;
      cardiac compressions, and 0.05% receive compressions with Epinephrine. These events are rare&#xD;
      but stressful and require fast response. High stress impairs cognitive skills, including&#xD;
      decision making, short-term memory, knowledge recall, and situational attention. In order to&#xD;
      help practitioners, guidelines and algorithm exists: The neonatal resuscitation program (NRP)&#xD;
      and International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) algorithm outlines essential&#xD;
      steps to take to assist a neonate immediately after birth. ILCOR algorithm poster is present&#xD;
      in every delivery room in France. Nevertheless, studies have shown a 16-55% error rate in&#xD;
      adherence to the NRP algorithm. Despite periodic training skills deterioration, technical&#xD;
      performance, and aptitude to follow recommendations decline over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of cognitive aids might be a solution to prevent errors in critical situation.&#xD;
      Cognitive aids are defined as &quot;prompts designed to help users complete a task or series of&#xD;
      tasks.&quot; The design of cognitive aids includes posters, checklists, mnemonics, or digital&#xD;
      tools like computer programs or smartphone applications. Poster or checklist cognitive aids&#xD;
      are widely used to help health care to follow standardized procedures while facing&#xD;
      high-cognitive loads situations. Many digital cognitive aids have been developed in intensive&#xD;
      care (cardiac arrest) and anesthesiology both in adult and pediatric fields. They have been&#xD;
      shown to improve technical skills along with guideline adherence in adult's study. Influence&#xD;
      of cognitive aids on technical and nontechnical skills has not been investigated extensively&#xD;
      and is still controversial in pediatrics. In neonatology some studies exist but with&#xD;
      discordant results. MAX (Medical Assistance eXpert) is a mobile French cognitive aid&#xD;
      available on smartphone or tablet. The use of MAX has been shown to improve technical and&#xD;
      nontechnical skill in previous adult studies. To evaluate the usefulness of digital cognitive&#xD;
      aid in neonatal critical situations, ILCOR 2020 algorithm was included in MAX. A previous&#xD;
      unpublished pilot study in neonatal simulated cardiopulmonary arrest shown feasibility in&#xD;
      trinomials and improvement in technical skill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We performed an unblinded randomized trial comparing the use of a digital, hand-held,&#xD;
      cognitive aid (a mobile application named &quot;MAX NEONAT&quot;) and the ILCOR 2020 algorithm poster,&#xD;
      vs. without cognitive aid, to test the hypothesis that MAX NEONAT could improve technical&#xD;
      performance and affect non-technical performance of pediatric residents and mid wife-students&#xD;
      facing simulated neonatal cardiac arrest.&#xD;

    <measure>The primary outcome is a technical performance score, adapted from of a previously published checklist score. The technical score follows the (International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation recommendations (ILCOR).</measure>
    <time_frame>DAY 1</time_frame>
    <description>the NRP checklist ( Neonatal Rescucitation Program) score we utilized is a previously published technical performance score adapted from the ILCOR 2020 recommendations. This revised NRP score is composed of 27 points. For each action, trinomials are given a score of 0 for not performing the action, 1 for performing the task correctly and in order.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>non-technical skills, evaluated by an adaptation of a previously published checklist score. The non-technical score includes three categories: leadership, teamwork and task management. The score has a total of 36 points. A questionnaire evaluating the functionality and usefulness of the mobile phone application will be analyzed.</description>
