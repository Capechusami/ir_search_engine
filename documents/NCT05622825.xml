  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of liver cancer needs integrated medical strategies, including surgery,&#xD;
      chemotherapy, target therapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. According to the patient's&#xD;
      condition to develop a personalized and best treatment plan. Cryoablation can produce osmotic&#xD;
      shock through repeated freeze-thaw to cause tumor cell necrosis, and release tumor antigens&#xD;
      to activate anti-tumor immune responses. Immune cell therapy is an emerging field across&#xD;
      cancer types in current cancer treatment. This study desired to combine cryotherapy and&#xD;
      cellular immunotherapy to achieve the effect of tumor control. In recent years, cancer&#xD;
      treatment studies have showed that cryoablation combined with immune cell therapy can play a&#xD;
      good auxiliary effect and improve the cancer treatment efficacy significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial study is a single center, single-arm, non-blind open-label human clinical trial.&#xD;
      To explore the therapeutic effect and safety of cryoablation combined with autologous DC-CIK&#xD;
      (through hepatic artery infusion, HAI) for patients with advanced liver cancers. The DC-CIK&#xD;
      biologics are provided by BOHUI Biotech company. Their core technology (including clinical&#xD;
      treatment and cell culture techniques) was transferred from Dr. Hasumi who is a Japanese&#xD;
      clinician and this technical founder.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has&#xD;
      released the latest global cancer burden data for 2020, which shows that 19.3 million new&#xD;
      cancer cases happened and nearly 10 million deaths occurred in 2020. Currently, one in five&#xD;
      people of the world will have cancer in their lifetime, and one in eight men and one in 11&#xD;
      women will die of cancer. According Taiwan Cancer registry introduction from Ministry of&#xD;
      Health and Welfare in 2017, the number of new cancer cases was 111,684, 5,852 more people&#xD;
      than in 2015. Liver cancer, in particular, ranks fourth in the cancer rankings. The main&#xD;
      causes of liver cancer are hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or cirrhosis of the liver caused by&#xD;
      alcohol. Other causes include Aspergillus flavus toxin, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and&#xD;
      liver aspirates etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune cell therapy is an emerging field in the treatment of advanced liver cancer. Many&#xD;
      types of immune effector cells such as lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, dendritic&#xD;
      cells (DC), tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) cells, cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells,&#xD;
      and lymphocyte-activated lymphocyte (LAK) cells are used to treat advanced liver cancer. CIK&#xD;
      cells have been developed for immunotherapy applications. CIK cells such as CD3+CD56+ cells,&#xD;
      CD3+CD56- cells and CD3-CD56+ cells, have the ability to kill tumors directly by&#xD;
      demonstrating the non-restrictive cytolytic effect of MHC, similar to the function of general&#xD;
      T cells. CIK cells bind to LFA-1 ligands on tumor cells through LFA-1, resulting in tumor&#xD;
      cell killing, and then binding of the receptor to its ligand on NK cells initiates a&#xD;
      downstream cell signaling pathway and further activates CIK cells for tumor cytotoxicity.&#xD;
      Finally, CIK cells activate the signaling pathway via Fas-FasL and induce apoptosis in cancer&#xD;
      cells. DCs are differentiated from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, often in the&#xD;
      form of monocytes, which differentiate into mature dendritic cells in response to cytokine&#xD;
      stimulation. After tumor-associated antigen (TAA) phagocytosis, antigens are treated by two&#xD;
      pathways, the cytosolic pathway and vacuolar pathway, by which they are processed into&#xD;
      peptides and loaded onto the major histocompatibility complex class I(MHC I). Then the&#xD;
      TAA-MHC I complex is delivered to the DC surface. When DC-presenting TAAs migrate and reach&#xD;
      the lymph nodes, they are able of priming T cells and prompting anti-tumor immunity.&#xD;
      Dendritic cells are efficient activators of na√Øve T cells and are potent APCs. They play a&#xD;
      central role in immune-mediated cancer elimination through antigen presentation and T-cell&#xD;
      priming. More recently, they have been combined to form DC-CIK cell therapy, which is a&#xD;
      combination immunotherapy where DC and CIK cells are cultured together. In terms of&#xD;
      therapeutic mechanism, dendritic cells are specialized antigen-presenting cells, and mature&#xD;
      dendritic cells can present tumor antigens via the MHC-I pathway to effectively counteract&#xD;
      the immune escape mechanism of tumor cells. The specific tumor-killing effect of CIK is&#xD;
      further enhanced. Many studies have shown that treating cancer patients with DC-CIK cells&#xD;
      significantly prolong the survival time and enhance the immune function of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent trends in cancer treatment have confirmed that when cryoablation of tumors is combined&#xD;
      with immune cell therapy, it can have a good complementary effect and significantly improve&#xD;
      the efficacy of cancer treatment. It is believed that cryotherapy causes necrosis of tumor&#xD;
      cells through the physical changes of osmotic shock produced by repeated freezing and&#xD;
      thawing, which in turn releases tumor antigens and activates anti-tumor immune responses. A&#xD;
      retrospective study conducted in 2013 in patients with stage IV lung cancer investigated the&#xD;
      efficacy of cryoablation combined with immune cell DC-CIK and showed that cryoablation with&#xD;
      DC-CIK significantly prolonged the overall survival (OS) of patients. The results of the 2017&#xD;
      clinical trial showed that cryoablation with NK cell therapy improved the clinical response&#xD;
      rate and disease control rate (DCR) of patients with advanced lung cancer, with the&#xD;
      proportion of patients with PR (63.3% vs. 43.3%, P&lt;0.01) and disease control rate ( The&#xD;
      results of the clinical trial in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma showed that among 61&#xD;
      patients admitted from 2015 to 2017, cryoablation with NK immunotherapy significantly&#xD;
      prolonged the progression free survival (PFS) of patients (9.5%). (PFS) (9.1 months vs. 7.6&#xD;
      months, P=0.0107), response rate (60% vs. 46.1%, P&lt;0.05) and disease control rate (85.7% vs.&#xD;
      69.2%, P&lt;0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was designed as a single-arm, uncontrolled, open-label, non-random assignment&#xD;
      design. The efficacy and safety of hepatic artery infusion with autologous DC-CIK immune&#xD;
      cells before and after ablation of liver tumors using cryoablation technique in patients with&#xD;
      advanced liver cancer was investigated. The DC-CIK immune cell therapy technology was&#xD;
      developed in collaboration with Bohui Biotech, and the core cell technology was transferred&#xD;
      from Dr. Hasumi autologous immune cell therapy in Japan. The program will track the changes&#xD;
      in tumor size and tumor index before and after treatment, and conduct safety assessment to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of this trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the clinical trial, peripheral blood will be collected from patients for exploratory&#xD;
      index analysis to complement the clinical evaluation results. According to the results of the&#xD;
      clinical study in 2013, patients with stage IV solid cancer who had failed standard treatment&#xD;
      had increased CD8+CD56+ cell populations after autologous immune cell therapy by Dr. Hasumi&#xD;
      in Japan and continued to be followed up until one year later. In 2019, a study also showed&#xD;
      that disease control was lower in the group of patients with liver cancer with high free DNA&#xD;
      concentrations treated with sorafenib than in the group with low free DNA concentrations. The&#xD;
      whole-genome sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to obtain copy number alteration (CNA)&#xD;
      profiles can be used as predictors of sorafenib treatment outcome. Therefore, in this&#xD;
      clinical trial, blood samples were taken from patients before and after treatment, and the&#xD;
      distribution of immune cell populations and changes in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in blood were&#xD;
      analyzed separately by separating the buffy coat and plasma using a density gradient&#xD;
      centrifuge, and using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. The qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity assay kit&#xD;
      (Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to quantify the amount of free DNA and to&#xD;
      detect the copy number of free DNA, and to analyze the free DNA to find out the biomarkers&#xD;
      that can be used for treatment effect tracking.&#xD;
