  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the concordance of treatment decisions made in&#xD;
      multidisciplinary consultation meeting based on targeted biopsies alone or targeted biopsies&#xD;
      associated with systematic biopsies in patients with suspected prostate cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in France and is the third most common cancer death&#xD;
      in men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early detection is based on family and ethnic history, digital rectal examination and total&#xD;
      PSA testing. It is done at age 50 for the general population but is restricted to men with an&#xD;
      estimated survival of more than 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of clinical suspicion of prostate cancer, the diagnosis is based on the realization&#xD;
      of prostate biopsies. Until recently, 12 so-called &quot;systematic&quot; (BS) biopsies were performed&#xD;
      under ultrasound control, according to a standardized protocol, which allowed sampling of the&#xD;
      entire prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the latest recommendations of the French Association of Urology in 2020, an MRI is&#xD;
      systematically indicated before performing biopsies. Indeed, MRI is a sensitive technique&#xD;
      that will increase the suspicion of significant prostate cancer. An MRI is considered&#xD;
      &quot;positive&quot; if at least one suspicious area with a PI-RADS score ≥ 3 is detected. In this&#xD;
      case, the French Association of Urology recommends performing so-called targeted biopsies&#xD;
      (BC) on these suspicious areas associated with the 12 SBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a technical point of view, ultrasound is the reference examination for performing&#xD;
      targeted biopsies on suspicious lesions detected on MRI, either by visual guidance (cognitive&#xD;
      identification) or by image fusion techniques, MRI and ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now technically possible to perform biopsies directly under MRI in clinical practice,&#xD;
      but the development of this approach remains limited in France. This technique makes it&#xD;
      possible to biopsy the suspect area without resorting to image fusion, thus limiting&#xD;
      targeting errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As only MRI can detect cancerous lesions, this study is based on the hypothesis that targeted&#xD;
      biopsies alone taken under MRI could make it possible to make a therapeutic decision within&#xD;
      the framework of a multidisciplinary consultation meeting (RCP) without resorting to&#xD;
      systematic biopsies under ultrasound.&#xD;
