      Objectives:To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BAT8008 for injection in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors, explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and provide the recommended&#xD;
      dose for subsequent clinical trials.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this multi-center, open, dose-increasing, dose-expanding Phase I clinical study, rapid&#xD;
      titration and a &quot;3+3&quot; dose-increasing design were used to explore the safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and PK characteristics of BAT8008 for injection in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
      During the dose-escalation test, appropriate doses were selected for the extended study&#xD;
      according to the previous study data.&#xD;
