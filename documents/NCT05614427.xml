      The Lateral Flow Antigen Validity and Applicability (LAVA) 2 study aims to determine the&#xD;
      validity of lateral flow antigen devices (LFDs) used to perform point of care testing for&#xD;
      COVID-19, compared to the current gold standard test of RTPCR in children. In a pilot study&#xD;
      we have shown that the anterior nose swabs used to perform a LFD test are associated with&#xD;
      significantly lower pain scores than the nose and throat swabs used to perform RT-PCR tests&#xD;
      and that the results are available significantly more quickly. RT-PCR is an excellent&#xD;
      diagnostic test but one drawback includes remaining positive for a prolonged period,&#xD;
      potentially when the person is no longer infective, as it can pick up viral particulate&#xD;
      rather than live virus. LFDs are more likely to be positive at the point that a person has a&#xD;
      high viral load and is therefore infectious to others, but this has not been studied in&#xD;
      non-laboratory settings in children. The study aims to determine the correlation between LFD&#xD;
      and viral load detected on RT-PCR in children to enable the utility of the test in different&#xD;
      clinical and non-clinical settings to be better determined.&#xD;

      Purpose and Design This study aims to answer key questions about testing for COVID-19 in&#xD;
      children. COVID-19 in children is very different from adults: COVID-19 infection is less&#xD;
      prevalent in children compared to adults and the disease course is very much milder, with&#xD;
      children being more likely to be asymptomatic than adults. Currently, all children admitted&#xD;
      to hospital or undergoing a procedure under general anaesthetic are routinely tested for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR performed on a nose and throat swab. Whilst this is an excellent&#xD;
      diagnostic test for someone who is symptomatic with COVID-19, it can remain positive for a&#xD;
      significant period after a person has been infected with COVID-19 and is no longer a risk to&#xD;
      others. In a clinical setting this can result in elective operations being cancelled,&#xD;
      potentially unnecessarily. Additionally, it means that children who may be infective with&#xD;
      COVID-19 are less likely to be symptomatic with the infection, indeed many patients who have&#xD;
      been diagnosed with COVID-19 have been admitted to hospital for an unrelated cause, making&#xD;
      differentiation on the basis of symptoms difficult. We have chosen to look primarily at the&#xD;
      relationship between lateral flow device tests performed on anterior nasal swabs, which are a&#xD;
      less painful swab and give a rapid result, compared to the viral load detected using RT-PCR&#xD;
      performed on a nose and throat swab. This will complement ongoing work which is being&#xD;
      performed outside of the group proposing this study, which is examining the relationship&#xD;
      between viral load and infectivity. This study will be able to determine the performance of&#xD;
      the LFD at different viral loads and therefore the utility of the LFD within clinical&#xD;
      settings to predict which patients are infective with SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been designed by a multidisciplinary team, described in the steering group.&#xD;
      Unfortunately due to the need to deliver this study rapidly, patient and parental input has&#xD;
      not been specifically sought but the pain scores described in the pilot study work display&#xD;
      the acceptability of this test to parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and consent In order to recruit a sufficient number of patients to answer the&#xD;
      study question in a timely way, as is required, we have built into the protocol the option to&#xD;
      take deferred consent to participate in the study. The acceptability of the swabs is clear&#xD;
      within the pilot study and the test is being widely used in community settings already.&#xD;
      Deferred consent is not felt to be appropriate for children in the peri-operative period due&#xD;
      to the impact that it may have on their clinical care and therefore patients and families&#xD;
      will be approached about the study before the swab is performed. In all other settings, a&#xD;
      routine swab for SARS-CoV-2 is being performed anyway which is more painful for the child&#xD;
      than the study swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specificity of the LFD has been shown to be very good (99.6%) in laboratory and clinical&#xD;
      settings and therefore employing the use of the LFD within the study may also enable&#xD;
      hospitals to detect asymptomatic infective children with COVID-19 earlier in their admission.&#xD;
      A recording of the patients who are approached before a routine swab is performed but who&#xD;
      decline the test will be kept to ensure that a swab is not performed anyway with the&#xD;
      assumption that they will be approached for deferred consent. The record will include the&#xD;
      child's hospital number and the parent's email address. No additional details will be held.&#xD;
      Patients will be approached for consent by being emailed a small amount of information about&#xD;
      the study with a link to the PIS followed by a link to the consent form, with the option to&#xD;
      record refusal of consent if they do not wish to participate. The appropriate PISC will be&#xD;
      sent according to whether they are approached before or after the anterior nose swab has been&#xD;
      taken. The person emailing the patients the PISC does not have to be GMP trained, but should&#xD;
      a patient or their family wish to ask questions they will have the details of the study&#xD;
      team's telephone number and email address. Inclusion/exclusion This study is intended to&#xD;
      include all children under 18 years of age who are undergoing routine swabbing or who are&#xD;
      having a procedure performed under general anaesthetic. Risks, burdens and benefits Having&#xD;
      undertaken the pilot study we have had opportunity to understand the impact on patients and&#xD;
      their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients and parents were positive about participating in the study, appreciating the&#xD;
      opportunity to have an additional test prior to an operation and getting the results of the&#xD;
      LFD test back more quickly. As shown in the pilot study, the pain scores given by children&#xD;
      and parents were significantly lower using anterior nasal swabs compared to nose and throat&#xD;
      swabs suggesting that there is much higher acceptability of the test. Some participants did&#xD;
      refuse to participate because they were concerned that their child may find an additional&#xD;
      swab distressing or because they did not want to run the risk of a long-awaited elective&#xD;
      procedure being cancelled. During the pilot study we found no adverse events associated with&#xD;
      the anterior nasal swabs and given the lower pain scores seen, can reassure parents that the&#xD;
      swab required for the LFD is significantly less painful for a child. Confidentiality We are&#xD;
      collecting the hospital number of each patient to enable accurate tracking of patients within&#xD;
      the study. These will be visible to the central study team but each site's patients will only&#xD;
      be visible to patients within that site. The first half of the postcode is being collected&#xD;
      because subsequent analysis of the positive predictive value of the test requires the&#xD;
      prevalence of COVID-19 to be known. The DOB and sex of the child is being collected so that&#xD;
      the demographics of the patients included in the study are known, enabling appropriate&#xD;
      conclusions to be drawn. CAG approval has not been sought as the COPI notice issued by the&#xD;
      Secretary of State allows the appropriate collection of data within studies focussed on&#xD;
      COVID-19 to be collected and can include people who do not sit within the direct care team to&#xD;
      contribute to the recruitment and running of the study. Conflict of interest None of the&#xD;
      study group have any declared conflict of interest in the study. The results will be given to&#xD;
      Public Health England and will be submitted for peer review and subsequent publication.&#xD;
