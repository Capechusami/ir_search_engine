  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Retrospective, Observational Multi-Center study, utilizing patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      up to a Grade1 spondylolisthesis or retrolisthesis or symptomatic degenerative disc disease&#xD;
      and treated with STALIF® C, or M, Ti and/or FLX implants at one or two levels.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to codify the performance of the STALIF family of products. Its design&#xD;
      is to provide retrospective data derived from the patient's medical and surgical chart and&#xD;
      prospectively assess the treating surgeon and patient on their level of satisfaction&#xD;
      post-operative up to present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects who sign an informed consent will be included in the prospective data collection&#xD;
      via chart review at the individual investigational sites. The prospective data will come from&#xD;
      subjects who complete the designated patient assessments as well as the treating surgeon. The&#xD;
      data collection period will include surgeries performed between 2014 to present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will support the safety profile of the product family and allow for comparison&#xD;
      to the available literature as well as between device types (Ti versus FLX). Furthermore,&#xD;
      data from this study will support post-market surveillance requirements for the STALIF family&#xD;
      of products.&#xD;

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing low back disability. Questionnaire consists of 10 sections with 6 possible choices in each section. Patient to choose 1 answer that best describes his/her ability to manage everyday activities. The questions weighted and summarized providing physical and mental health scores (PCS and MCS) ranging from 0 to 100. High scores indicating worse outcome and lower scores indicating better outcomes.</description>

    <description>Assessing cervical neck disability questionnaire. Questionnaire consists of 10 sections with 6 possible choices in each section. Patient to choose 1 answer that best describes his/her ability to manage everyday life activities. The questions weighted and summarized providing physical and mental health scores (PCS and MCS) and range from 0 to 100. High scores indicating worse outcome and lower scores indicating better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Lift Questionnaire (SF-12) Prospective Arm of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-op at 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>SF-12 consists of 12 questions. Responses scored and summarized into physical and mental health composite scores (PCS and MCS) and range from 0 to 100. Higher score indicating better health. Score of 0 is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
