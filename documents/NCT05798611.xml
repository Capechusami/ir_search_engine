  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This interventional study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ART0380 as monotherapy in&#xD;
      patients whose tumors have a biology to predict for sensitivity to inhibition of&#xD;
      Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated and Rad3-related protein kinase (ATR).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ART0380 is being developed as an oral anti-cancer agent for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      cancers that have defects in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit selected patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors,&#xD;
      specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with persistent or recurrent endometrial cancer (EC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors of any histology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Above patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two dose regimens of ART0380.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated on a quarterly basis, at a minimum. Patients may continue to receive&#xD;
      ART0380 as long as they are continuing to derive benefit from treatment or until disease&#xD;
      progression, withdrawal of consent, or until they experience unacceptable drug-related&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
