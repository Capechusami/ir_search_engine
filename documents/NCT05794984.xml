  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study seeks to address questions regarding internet and social media usage as&#xD;
      well as telemedicine concept and knowledge, by conducting targeted focus group discussions&#xD;
      (FGDs) and administering cross-sectional questionnaires among PWID in Greece. Further&#xD;
      parameters, such as perceptions for high-quality healthcare access, confidentiality, privacy,&#xD;
      and security, will also be explored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study's aim is to access the feasibility, acceptability and accessibility of social media&#xD;
      and telemedicine as methods to obtain healthcare, in order to improve linkage-to-care among&#xD;
      Greek substance users. Underserved populations, such as people who inject drugs (PWID) have&#xD;
      limited access to healthcare and a potential solution to expanding healthcare access points&#xD;
      is telemedicine. For the past decade, the investigators have studied the efficacy of a&#xD;
      facilitated telemedicine model for hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment integrated into opioid&#xD;
      treatment programs (OTPs) for PWIDs. The investigators have achieved high rates of HCV&#xD;
      resolution and high patient-satisfaction through facilitated telemedicine. The investigators&#xD;
      now seek to explore whether this same intervention might be feasible and acceptable in&#xD;
      Greece. The first step is to capture and explore the current knowledge, experiences,&#xD;
      believes, perceptions and attitudes of PWID in Greece regarding internet and social media&#xD;
      usage and telemedicine concept, through targeted Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and&#xD;
      administration of cross-sectional questionnaire. The perceptions for high-quality healthcare,&#xD;
      confidentiality, privacy and security matters will also be explored as well as further&#xD;
      relevant attributes.&#xD;
