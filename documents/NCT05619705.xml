  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of H42-HV integrated into home&#xD;
      visiting compared with usual home visiting services in reducing postpartum weight retention&#xD;
      (difference between pre-pregnancy weight and weight at 6 months postpartum) among pregnant&#xD;
      and postpartum women. The intervention is tailored for Black and Latinx pregnant and&#xD;
      postpartum women and, ultimately, aims to address inequities in cardiometabolic health.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are four components of the H42-HV intervention: 1) Health coaching calls; 2) H42&#xD;
      web-based app for learning activities and goal setting functions; 3) Tracking of health&#xD;
      behaviors (diet, exercise), and 4) Self-weighing (weekly). The overarching behavioral goals&#xD;
      of the intervention are for participants to have lower postpartum weight retention at 6&#xD;
      months after delivery. Weight and behavioral goals will be promoted through the COACH Plan, a&#xD;
      behavioral model guiding coaching calls, behavioral tracking targets and learning activities.&#xD;
      Coaches will refer to home visitors for additional support and community resources, based on&#xD;
      an established protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Telephone health coaching calls by trained health coaches. Calls start at enrollment, as&#xD;
           early in pregnancy as possible (latest start will be 33-weeks gestation) through 6&#xD;
           months postpartum. Although coaching calls will occur by phone (~20 mins), when&#xD;
           possible, some coach contact could occur at the time of home visits in person, or via&#xD;
           video interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Online interactive learning activities. Literacy adaptation ensured Learning Activities&#xD;
           are at &lt;5th grade reading level. All activities are translated into Spanish and&#xD;
           culturally adapted to create a parallel program. Online learning activities contain&#xD;
           embedded images (people and settings) that reflect the diversity of the investigators'&#xD;
           target population, examples of activities that are readily available in the community&#xD;
           and maximize the use of white space, large text and simple graphics to enhance&#xD;
           readability and accessibility of the educational content. The investigators enhanced the&#xD;
           platform to enable an interactive goal-setting functionality for participants to set&#xD;
           health goals paced with participants' Learning Activities and calls. The online program&#xD;
           is maintained and monitored by the study's health coach managers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health behavior tracking (diet and exercise). Participants will receive specific&#xD;
           skill-building on how to track diet and exercise behaviors via mainstream mobile app or&#xD;
           paper/pencil, using procedures from the investigators' current trial. Coaches will be&#xD;
           able to discuss tracking data with participants. Mainstream tracking apps are available&#xD;
           in both Spanish and English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly self-weighing. Participants will be asked to weigh themselves weekly at home&#xD;
           using the participants' study scale.&#xD;
