  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study that is intended to determine the capacity of three&#xD;
      technologies to serve as diagnostic biomarkers for myofascial pain syndrome. We will seek&#xD;
      patients with myofasical pain syndrome as well as healthy subjects for this study. Electrical&#xD;
      impedance myography (EIM), myofiber threshold tracking (TT) excitability testing, and&#xD;
      ultrasound with shear wave elastography (SWE) measurements will be obtained from the&#xD;
      trapezius muscle (the muscle that extends over the back of the neck and shoulders). These&#xD;
      measurements will be repeated within 2-5 days to assess repeatability of these methods.&#xD;

      Study Visit One:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. History and examination (All participants). After reviewing the purpose and procedures&#xD;
           of the study, the subject, or a legally authorized representative (LAR), will be asked&#xD;
           to sign the internal review board-approved informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Basic medical, social, and family histories will then be obtained and recorded. Previous&#xD;
           medical records will be reviewed. Medications, including drug doses, history of recent&#xD;
           medication changes, and duration of treatment) will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A brief physical exam will be performed. If the subject has MPS, the study doctor will&#xD;
           identify the trigger points and will mark those with a permanent marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Electrical Impedance Myography (EIM) - a trained technician will apply several small&#xD;
           sticky pads (electrodes) to different parts of the subject's muscle and a very tiny&#xD;
           electrical current will be applied that they will not feel. Several measurements will be&#xD;
           done their muscle. This will take approximately 10 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Ultrasound (US) - a trained technician will apply a small amount of gel to the skin.&#xD;
           They will hold a small hand-held device on the skin and will measure the muscle. The gel&#xD;
           is easily cleaned off of the skin when the testing is complete. This will take&#xD;
           approximately 20 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Threshold Tracking (TT) - TT tests how quickly muscle responds to stimulation. The&#xD;
           muscle is stimulated using a small needle which is placed superficially in their&#xD;
           trapezius muscle. The subject will feel a small needle prick which should be less&#xD;
           uncomfortable than having blood drawn. Electrodes (small sticky pads) are placed a short&#xD;
           distance from the needle over the muscle. When their muscle is stimulated with the&#xD;
           needle, the time it takes for the muscle to react is measured by the electrodes. This&#xD;
           procedure will last 30 minutes and creates a tingling feeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Questionnaires- Subjects will be asked to complete some brief questionnaires about their&#xD;
           pain, mood, and sleep. Overall, this visit will take approximately 1 - 1.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Period Subjects will be asked to re-inforce/re-apply the permanent marker spots made at&#xD;
      their first visit. This is so we can use the same spots for testing at the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit 2 (2-14 days after Study Visit #1) The second study visit is identical to the&#xD;
      first one. A study team member will test the subject's trigger points again at the beginning&#xD;
      of the visit. This visit will also last approximately 1-1.5 hours.&#xD;

In addition to the sharing of resources during the trial, the investigators of this study are fully committed to participate in data sharing as per NIH policies. Following completion of all planned analyses and manuscripts, we will make the data and associated documentation available to qualified users though repositories like the Biomedical Informatics Research Network (BIRN), which is capable of supporting large volumes of data (e.g. neuroimaging), and NIH HEAL Initiative Central Data Repository.</ipd_description>
