    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open, parallel controlled clinical study. Patients with advanced&#xD;
      esophageal cancer who have not received any previous systemic antitumor therapy for&#xD;
      esophageal cancer were selected to compare the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab combined&#xD;
      with chemoradiotherapy versus camrelizumab combined with chemotherapy.&#xD;
