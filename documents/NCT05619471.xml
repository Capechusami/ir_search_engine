    <textblock>
      To demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the VIO device in obtaining in vivo images&#xD;
      that show tissue features including epidermis, dermis, collagen, blood vessels, and/or&#xD;
      pigment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate that the tissue features identified on the images obtained with the VIO device&#xD;
      align with the corresponding pathology images procured from the skin biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the ability of blinded readers to correctly identify tissue features on images&#xD;
      obtained with the VIO device.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject is between 18 and 99 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) is able and willing to provide&#xD;
             written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject is planning to undergo a routine skin biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The subject is willing and able to remain still for periods of up to 3 minutes to&#xD;
             allow for image capture.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject or LAR has sufficient mental capacity to understand the informed consent&#xD;
             form (ICF) and comply with the protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject has a general health condition or systemic disease that in the opinion of&#xD;
             the physician, precludes them from trial participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has a known allergy or increased skin sensitivity to silicone, adhesives,&#xD;
             or glycerin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject's lesion targeted for biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Is located on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, fingernails, or&#xD;
                  toenails.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Has dense hair that will not be removed prior to the skin biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Has clinically significant abraded or ulcerated skin with or without discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Is associated with a wound or skin condition that in the opinion of the physician&#xD;
                  precludes them from participation&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Is located in mucosal tissue (i.e., oral, nasal, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Is on tattooed skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Is on a skin formation too tortuous for the investigational device to access&#xD;
                  (e.g., skin tags.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Is located in the periorbital region or directly on the eyelid.&#xD;
