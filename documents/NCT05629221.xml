      The goal of this randomised trial is to evaluate the impact of using a digital platform&#xD;
      called &quot;TreC Diabete&quot; embedded into a novel organizational asset for poorly controlled type 2&#xD;
      diabetes individuals in the Autonomous Province of Trento (PAT). The main question aims to&#xD;
      answer whether individuals using the &quot;TreC Diabete&quot; platform will improve their haemoglobin&#xD;
      glycated level (Hb1Ac) at 12-month post-randomisation. Participants will be asked to perform&#xD;
      some tasks and to share their data with the healthcare staff members through the platform.&#xD;
      Control group will receive standard care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a non-communicable disease representing one of the most&#xD;
      serious public health challenges of the 21st century. Its incidence continues to rise in both&#xD;
      developed and developing countries, causing the death of 1.5 million people every year. The&#xD;
      use of technology (e.g. Smartphone application - App) in the health field has progressively&#xD;
      increased as it has been proved effective in helping some individuals manage their long-term&#xD;
      diseases. Therefore, it has the potential to reduce health service utilization and its&#xD;
      related costs. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of using a digital&#xD;
      platform called &quot;TreC Diabete&quot; embedded into a novel organizational asset targeting poorly&#xD;
      controlled T2DM individuals in the Autonomous Province of Trento (PAT), Italy.This trial was&#xD;
      designed as a multi-center, open-label, randomised, superiority study with two&#xD;
      parallel-groups and a 1:1 allocation ratio. Individuals regularly attending outpatients&#xD;
      diabetes clinics, providing informed consent are randomised to be prescribed TreC Diabete&#xD;
      platform or not as part of their personalised care plan. Healthcare staff members will&#xD;
      remotely assess the data shared by the participants through the App by using a dedicated&#xD;
      online medical dashboard. The primary end-point is the evaluation of the Hb1Ac level at&#xD;
      12-month post-randomisation. Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis.This&#xD;
      trial is the first conducted in the PAT for the use of an App specifically designed for&#xD;
      individuals with poorly controlled T2DM. If the effects of introducing this specific App&#xD;
      within a new organizational asset are positive, the digital platform will represent a&#xD;
      possible way for people diagnosed with T2DM to better manage their health in the future.&#xD;
      Results will be disseminated through conferences and peer-reviewed journals once the study is&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;

    <description>Sixty individuals allocated to the intervention group are prescribed with the TreC Diabete App for 12 months, one of the App created within the so-called TreC platform, which enables citizens from PAT to access, manage and share information about their health and wellbeing in the context of telemedicine. The use of the App is additional to the standard care, based on the integrated preventive and diagnostic care pathway (called &quot;Percorsi Preventivi Diagnostici Terapeutici Assistenziali - PPDTA&quot; in Italian).An appointment with the outpatient diabetes clinic staff is scheduled at 6 and 12 month from the first visit (taking place within 30 days of the study entry), either through telemedicine (remote visit) or face-to-face.</description>

    <description>Sixty individuals are allocated to the control group. These participants will receive standard care, which is the best care for T2DM in line with the integrated preventive and diagnostic care pathway (called &quot;Percorsi Preventivi Diagnostici Terapeutici Assistenziali - PPDTA&quot; in Italian).An appointment with the outpatient diabetes clinic staff is scheduled at 6 and 12 month from the first visit (taking place within 30 days of the study entry), either through telemedicine (remote visit) or face-to-face. Participants are asked to register their data as per routine (e.g. paper diary).</description>

    <description>Participants can download the App from Google Play or Apple Store and activate the App as soon as the clinician provides them a unique activation code, created through an online medical dashboard. The dashboard allows the interaction between healthcare staff and the participant through the use of a chat or a video-chat. Participants are asked to register some information in the App at set times (e.g. blood pressure). Reminders are periodically sent to remember the participants to perform some tasks. Clinicians will periodically check the information entered by the participant (min frequency 45 days).</description>
