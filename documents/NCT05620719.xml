  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic headache (PTH) is a common and highly disabling consequence of traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury (TBI) in U.S. military service members and veterans. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for&#xD;
      PTH has been shown to significantly improve disability outcomes in veterans with persistent&#xD;
      PTH when delivered in-person. Telemedicine platforms can dramatically increase access to&#xD;
      evidence-based care. However, whether CBT for PTH retains its effectiveness when delivered&#xD;
      through a telemedicine platform has yet to be established. The purpose of this 3-arm&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial is to compare Clinic-based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CCBT) to&#xD;
      Telemedicine-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TCBT) and to treatment as usual (TAU) in 525&#xD;
      service members and veterans with chronic posttraumatic headaches (PTH) at 3 VA medical&#xD;
      centers and 4 military treatment facilities across the U.S. Participants will be assessed for&#xD;
      headache-related disability, headache experience, and psychiatric comorbidities across&#xD;
      multiple time points.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic headache (PTH) is noticeably more common among military service members and&#xD;
      veterans than among civilians, with an estimated 80-90% of veterans with TBI reporting new or&#xD;
      exacerbated headaches. Unlike civilian PTH, military and veteran PTH is likely to become&#xD;
      chronic and recalcitrant to most front-line interventions for primary headache (e.g.,&#xD;
      migraine, tension-type). Service members and veterans with PTH report significantly decreased&#xD;
      productivity in work and home activities and high rates of military discharge and work&#xD;
      absenteeism. Pharmacological treatments for chronic PTH have proven problematic (i.e.,&#xD;
      unwanted side effects; worsening of symptoms long term). However, prior to 2019, guidance for&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatment approaches for PTH was unclear. In 2019, the investigators&#xD;
      completed a single-site randomized clinical trial comparing Clinic-based CBT for PTH to&#xD;
      Treatment at Usual in 193 veterans with PTH. The study found that Clinic-based CBT for PTH&#xD;
      led to a significant improvement in headache-related disability (as measured by the 6-Item&#xD;
      Headache Impact Test; HIT-6) at follow-up. In contrast, headache disability scores for&#xD;
      participants in the Treatment as Usual condition remained unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread recognition of the need for distance-technology platforms&#xD;
      to add meaningful infrastructure for extended service delivery without the limitations of&#xD;
      in-office care. Telehealth-based care can decrease the cost and increase the convenience of&#xD;
      treatment leading some to suggest that telehealth may eventually become a first option for&#xD;
      treating patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the potential impact of CBT for PTH to improve the functioning of service members and&#xD;
      veterans with PTH following TBI, it is important to determine whether the results of the&#xD;
      single-site trial can be replicated across diverse geographic regions and whether CBT for PTH&#xD;
      retains its efficacy in improving headache-related disability when delivered through&#xD;
      telemedicine platforms.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Headache Impact Test (HIT-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Headache-disability as measured by the Headache Impact Test. The HIT-6 is a 6-item measure of headache-disability. The measure uses a 5-point Likert scale to rate the frequency that the respondent experiences headache-relate disability across six domains of functioning. Total scores range from 36 to 78 with higher scores representing a higher level of headache-relate disability.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Headache frequency, duration and intensity will be assessed using a smartphone-based daily headache self-monitoring diary developed by the HCoE. During treatment, participants will record their headache intensity twice daily, using a 0 to 10 scale, to assess: (a) days per week with a headache (ranging from 0 to 7); (b) weekly headache frequency (range from 0 to 10); (c) headache duration (&gt;= 0 hours); and (d) average peak headache intensity (range from 0 to 10).</description>

Each item is rated on a frequency scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Nearly Every day). The measure provides a total severity score that ranges from 0 to 27, with higher scores representing more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

Additionally, TCBT includes instructions for each session specific to the mechanics of a telehealth encounter (e.g., asking participant for name, location, and accessible phone number for location in case of technical failure or crisis). All TCBT participants must be enrolled at the MTF or VA from which they were recruited, and the treatment facility will be notified that they are receiving TCBT in case a crisis arises and needs to be managed by the site.</description>
