    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to determine the feasibility of a 12-week program of Tai&#xD;
      Chi for memory (TCM) among older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia and&#xD;
      to determine the effects of TCM on physical functioning, depression, and health-related QoL.&#xD;
      Two experimental groups will be recruited for inclusion criteria of community-residing older&#xD;
      adults with a diagnosis of either MCI or Dementia.&#xD;

      The purpose of the study are to determine the acceptability of a 12-week program of Tai Chi&#xD;
      for memory (TCM) among older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia; and to&#xD;
      determine the effects of TCM on physical functioning, depression, and health-related QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quasi-experimental design was used with two groups classified according to the level of&#xD;
      their cognitive impairment (MCI vs. Dementia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression, health-related QoL, and physical functioning including grip strength, balance,&#xD;
      flexibility, and mobility were measured before and after the 12-week TCM program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression was measured using the Korean version of the Geriatric Depression Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-related QoL was measured using the 12-item Short Form survey (SF-12). Grip strength&#xD;
      was assessed using a digital hand dynamometer. Flexibility was assessed using the standard&#xD;
      sit-and-reach test. Balance was measured using the one-leg-standing balance test. Mobility&#xD;
      was assessed using the timed up and go test. Paired and independent t-tests will be used to&#xD;
      compare the effects of TCM within and between groups.&#xD;

    <description>TCM is a standardized type of Tai Chi for health developed by Dr. Lam specifically for those who experience or want to prevent cognitive problems. TCM, consisting of 12 Sun-style and Yang-style Tai Chi movements, can be provided while sitting and while standing with five blocked movement sets so that cognitively impaired individuals (MCI vs. dementia) are able to follow them.</description>
