  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood malnutrition is a global public health issue with devastating consequences on the&#xD;
      health, well-being, and psychosocial development of children. Emerging evidence suggests that&#xD;
      malnourished children have immature gut microbiota compared to age-matched healthy controls&#xD;
      and it does not repair even after nutritional interventions. The present study aims to&#xD;
      characterize how the gut microbiome develops during the first two years of life in children&#xD;
      residing in Newly Merged Districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the region with the highest&#xD;
      prevalence of childhood malnutrition in Pakistan and the region.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition in children remains a global public health challenge. The consequences are often&#xD;
      severe and deadly, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where malnutrition&#xD;
      contributes to ~half of deaths in children under five years of age. Pakistan is among those&#xD;
      nations with the highest burden of stunting (40.2%), wasting (17.7%), and micronutrient&#xD;
      deficiency in children under five years of age. Recently, scientists discovered that the&#xD;
      trillions of microbes (gut microbiome) that live in the human gut affect the nutritional&#xD;
      status and overall health of children during the initial years of life. In this context,&#xD;
      research studies from developing countries, where malnutrition is common, have reported an&#xD;
      impaired or immature gut microbiome in malnourished (stunted, wasted, and underweight)&#xD;
      children compared to matched healthy controls and it does not repair even after nutritional&#xD;
      intervention. Therefore, a nutritional intervention strategy that does not take into account&#xD;
      the gut microbiome microbiota will fail to ameliorate the long-term consequences of&#xD;
      malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective cohort study from Pakistan, healthy infants (n=70) aged 0 - 14 days will&#xD;
      be recruited from District Khyber and followed every 4 months for two years. Ante-natal and&#xD;
      postnatal history, Dietary intake data, dietary diversity, Infant and young child feeding&#xD;
      (IYCF practices), and Health outcomes data will be collected every three months for two&#xD;
      years. The investigators will also collect blood and stool samples and conduct anthropometric&#xD;
      assessments of both mother and the baby at each time point. Advanced, next-generation&#xD;
      sequencing technology will be used to explore gut microbiome diversity and functional&#xD;
      potential.&#xD;

        The eligible participants (neonates) will be identified by searching the health record of&#xD;
        mothers who have recently given birth in selected healthcare facilities (hospitals) of&#xD;
        District Khyber, formerly known as Khyber Agency. Facilities will be selected based on the&#xD;
        availability of delivery and postnatal care services and the availability of trained&#xD;
        healthcare staff. Recruitment will be done either directly in the postnatal care ward or&#xD;
        indirectly by phone calls if the babies, who are delivered on weekends or holidays or are&#xD;
        not available to recruit while they were in the hospital.&#xD;
