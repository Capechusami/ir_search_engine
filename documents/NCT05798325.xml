  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The low prevalence of rare diseases hinders the design of clinical studies with sufficient&#xD;
      statistical power to demonstrate the efficacy of new drugs. This can only be achieved by&#xD;
      setting up international multicentre studies, which is challenging due to a lack of&#xD;
      objective, universal outcome measures that generate high-quality, reproducible data. One of&#xD;
      the hurdles in attaining universal outcome measures for clinical trials is the difficulty to&#xD;
      capture and distinguish ambulatory from non-ambulatory, autonomous and assistive or&#xD;
      involuntary movements. This makes a trial assessing the ambulatory phase very challenging at&#xD;
      this moment. Excluding many participants from trials and many patients from access to&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Integration and validation of the technology in trials, research and patients' lives is&#xD;
      essential in overcoming this hurdle. For example, in dystrophinopathies separate outcome&#xD;
      measures exist for ambulant and non-ambulant participants, but the relation between these&#xD;
      outcome measures or a transitional outcome measure/end point is largely missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an exhaustive literature review, several tools have been selected to remotely&#xD;
      follow various symptoms of neuromuscular patients including weakness, pain, fatigue,&#xD;
      cognitive defects, motor impairments (including loss of dexterity, ataxia...), metabolic,&#xD;
      respiratory and cardiac troubles, contractures, tremor, falls, hypo or hypersomnia... The&#xD;
      toolbox includes common measures for all patients but may include additional measures&#xD;
      specific to the patient's symptoms (hence in turn to the patients' disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurements are designed to not be invasive, intrusive or burdensome for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DT4RD is going to leverage state-of-the art technology, clinical rating scales and&#xD;
      psychometric/data analysis to deliver fit for purpose remote clinical assessments of mobility&#xD;
      to ensure maximum patient benefit, specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare face to face clinical data collected in hospital with Patient Generated Data&#xD;
           recorded remotely&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine how sensors can enhance measurement potentially at home and during clinical&#xD;
           visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Promote a clear focus on user centered design and the integration of technology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use reliability and validity analyses to equate any common measures (those with the same&#xD;
           or a similar construct)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate a proof-of-concept model into which different measures can be&#xD;
           interchangeable&#xD;
