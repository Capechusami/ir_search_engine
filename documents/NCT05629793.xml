  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has resulted, in addition to the well-known acute&#xD;
      symptoms, in the emergence of persistent, diffuse and heterogeneous symptoms referred to as&#xD;
      persistent COVID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction, among&#xD;
      others, and result in an impact on daily functioning. Symptoms may be new onset, appear after&#xD;
      initial recovery from an acute episode of COVID-19, or persist after the initial illness.&#xD;
      Cardiac variability (HRV) was initially used in COVID-19 to predict mortality in the acute&#xD;
      setting. Dysautonomia which partly evaluates HRV is frequent in patients with persistent&#xD;
      COVID. Several groups have used voice or other respiratory noise analysis for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of acute COVID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the persistent COVID cohort will be able to be differentiated from an age, sex&#xD;
      and vaccination status matched cohort of recovered COVID patients without sequelae by means&#xD;
      of a model created by Machine Learning that will be trained using cardiac variability (HRV),&#xD;
      skin conductance and acoustic analysis data. The primary objetive will be to obtain a&#xD;
      classification algorithm by Machine Learning to differentiate the group of patients with&#xD;
      persistent COVID diagnosis from the paired group of recovered COVID patients without&#xD;
      sequelae.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      This is a validation study of a Machine Learning algorithm for the diagnosis of persistent&#xD;
      COVID using clinical diagnosis as the &quot;gold standard&quot;. The sample will be composed of&#xD;
      post-COVID patients, one group of which developed persistent COVID and another paired with&#xD;
      the previous one with cured COVID without sequelae.&#xD;
