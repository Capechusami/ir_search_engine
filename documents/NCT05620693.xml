    <textblock>
      Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a kind of solid tumor with high heterogeneity. The treatment of&#xD;
      STS is complex and challenging, and surgery is still the main treatment method at present.&#xD;
      For patients who are inoperable or advanced, medical treatment should be considered, mainly&#xD;
      including chemotherapy and targeted treatment. At present, there is no standard second-line&#xD;
      treatment plan for patients who failed first-line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NY-ESO-1, a cancer testis antigen, is highly expressed in soft tissue tumors and is an ideal&#xD;
      therapeutic target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators aim to testify the safety and efficacy of NY-ESO-1 TCR-T cell in advanced soft&#xD;
      tissue sarcoma.&#xD;
