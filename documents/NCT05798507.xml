    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial tests brain concentration level and safety of defactinib or VS-6766&#xD;
      for the treatment of patients with glioblastoma. Recently, two new drugs that seem to work&#xD;
      together have been shown to have promising treatment effects in tissue culture and animal&#xD;
      models of glioblastoma. Each inhibits a different glioblastoma growth pathway and when used&#xD;
      together may create a larger effect on tumor growth than either alone. Growth pathway&#xD;
      describes a series of chemical reactions in which a group of molecules in a cell work&#xD;
      together to control cell growth. It is known that glioblastoma tumor cells can grow because&#xD;
      of lack of regulation. Both Pyk2 and the closely related kinase (FAK) proteins help regulate&#xD;
      tumor cell invasion, unless they are produced in large amounts (over expressed).&#xD;
      Specifically, Raf and FAK/Pyk2 regulation of cell division is activated quite a bit more in&#xD;
      gliomas compared to normal tissues. Recently developed inhibitors of Raf (VS-6766) and FAK&#xD;
      (defactinib) which belong to a class of medications called kinase inhibitors, are aimed to&#xD;
      bring their activity to proper levels and may stop tumor growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate (or characterize) the concentration of defactinib or avutometinib (VS-6766) that&#xD;
      accumulates in the glioblastoma (GBM) and brain around tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess the safety of the administration of a single oral dose of defactinib or VS-6766 in&#xD;
      patients with glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the inhibition of Pyk2/FAK or MEK, Erk signaling in tumor and brain around tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess the pharmacodynamics of defactinib or VS-6766 in patients with glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of defactinib and avutometinib. Patients are&#xD;
      assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive 1 dose of defactinib orally (PO) while on study, prior to planned&#xD;
      tumor resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive 1 dose of avutometinib PO while on study, prior to planned tumor&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood collection and donate resected tumor tissue while on study.&#xD;

             Fredericia's QT correction formula. NOTE: This criterion does not apply to subjects&#xD;
             with a right or left bundle branch block&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate recovery from toxicities related to prior treatments to at least Grade 1 by&#xD;

             patients, and 1 month following the last dose of VS-6766 for female patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities, requirement for systemic&#xD;
             anticoagulation or potent CYP 2C8 inhibitors, and history of clinically significant&#xD;
             cardiac or pulmonary disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minors will be excluded from the investigation. Glioblastoma is the major form of&#xD;
             brain cancer in people over 50 years old. Pediatric cases of glioblastoma are&#xD;
             relatively rare. Besides this, there are crucial molecular differences between adult&#xD;
             and pediatric gliomas. Our preliminary data for proposed investigation were obtained&#xD;
             on GBM specimens and cultures developed from GBM tissues donated by adult subjects.&#xD;
             Results of investigation of adult glioma tissue cannot simply be extrapolated to&#xD;
             children. Therefore, our primary research focus is the investigation of GBM in adults.&#xD;
             If appropriate, a separate, age-specific study in children will be performed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women will be excluded from the study as altered hormonal and immunological&#xD;
             status can affect the study results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners will be excluded from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Systemic anti-cancer therapy within 4 weeks of the first dose of study therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prior malignancy, with the exception of curatively treated malignancies or&#xD;
             malignancies with very low potential for recurrence or progression&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Exposure to medications (with or without prescription), supplements, herbal remedies,&#xD;
             or foods with potential for drug-drug interactions with VS-6766 within 14 days prior&#xD;
             to the first dose of VS-6766 and during the course of therapy, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  VS-6766: strong CYP3A4, inhibitors or inducers, due to potential drug-drug&#xD;
                  interactions with VS-6766 and/or defactinib&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Defactinib: strong CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors or&#xD;
                  inducers, due to potential drug-drug interactions with VS-6766 and/or defactinib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that is&#xD;

                  predisposing factors for RVO, including uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled&#xD;
                  diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with history of retinal pathology or evidence of visible retinal&#xD;
                  pathology that is considered a risk factor for RVO, intraocular pressure &gt; 21 mm&#xD;
