  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with recalcitrant warts were randomized equally to receive laser or cryotherapy&#xD;
      every 3 to 4 weeks, for a maximum of 4 sessions.The primary outcomes were the cure rate at 16&#xD;
      weeks; secondary outcomes included time to clearance of warts, patient satisfaction with the&#xD;
      treatment and treatment-related adverse effects.&#xD;
