      This multicenter, prospective Phase I study is aimed at testing the safety of F8IL10 via i.a.&#xD;
      administration once every 4 weeks over 8 weeks in patients with RA who, despite treatment&#xD;
      with stable doses (at least 3 months) of DMARDs (conventional, biologic and/or targeted&#xD;
      synthetic), present arthritis flare(s) suitable for i.a. injections.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Dose escalation of F8IL10 to determine the MTD and the RD when administered intra-articular. A standard 3+3 dose escalation design from 0.5 to 10 mg of F8IL10 until the first instance of a DLT in the observation period from Day 1 to Day 28. In the absence of DLTs, such dose increase will continue until the MAD level is reached and won't exceed 10 mg dose level. With the occurrence of a DLT, the same dose level cohort will be expanded to 6 patients and, if additional DLTs do not occur, the dose escalation will continue to the next dose level. When two DLTs are recorded in the same dose level, MAD is automatically reached. The RD will be then defined by the DSMB .</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Preliminary efficay findings using jVAS scale in rheumatoid arthritis for quantifying pain intensity. Patients will assess their own current level of pain related to arthritis in target joint(s) that has been/will be injected. The information refers to a score of the joint pain perceived by the patient over the 7 days prior to the assessment and will be recorded using a 100-mm horizontal VAS where the left end represents &quot;no pain (0%)&quot; and the right end represents &quot;severe pain (100%)&quot;. The assessment provided at Day 1 (Week 1) will be considered as baseline measurement.</description>

    <description>Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) as validated tool for the evaluation of Disability Index (DI) or Functional Disability Index (FDI) by considering 8 sections: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. There are 2 or 3 questions for each section. Scoring within each section is from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). For each section, the score given to that section is the worst score within the section. The 8 scores of the 8 sections are summed and divided by 8. Changes from baseline through treatment period and follow-up will be quantified.</description>

These are summarized in two summary measures of physical and mental health: the Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary. Lower scores equate to higher disability and higher scores equate to lower disability. Changes from baseline through treatment period and follow-up will be quantified.</description>

    <description>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F) as validated 13-item questionnaire for the assessment of self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. It uses a 5-point Likert-type scale (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 = somewhat; 3 = quite a bit; 4 = very much). As each of the 13 items of the FACIT-Fatigue scale ranges from 0-4, the range of possible scores is 0-52, with 0 being the worst possible score and 52 the best.

    <description>Overall, 32 patients will participate in case no DLT would occur.&#xD;
In the standard 3+3 dose escalation part, participants will be enrolled in cohorts and will be treated with different doses of F8IL10 (from 0.5 to 10 mg) in order to identify a RD to be further explored in the subsequent dose expansion part. In the dose escalation part, patients will be treated in cohorts of 3 patients with escalating doses of F8IL10 until the MAD is reached and won't exceed 10 mg dose level. In case a DLT would be detected, further 3 patients will be enrolled for that cohort in order to confirm the MAD or to proceed with the next dose level. Therefore, up to 30 patients could be enrolled in the dose escalation part.&#xD;
Following successful identification of the RD, the study will proceed with a dose expansion part and 20 patients will be treated at the RD dose level (patients treated at the RD in the course of the dose escalation phase will contribute to the total sample size).</description>
