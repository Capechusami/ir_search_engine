  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the ability of tumor budding to identify prognosis in different MMR&#xD;
      states and different levels of tumor lymphocyte infiltration. Tumor budding is usually&#xD;
      defined as an isolated single cancer cell or a cluster of up to four cancer cells located at&#xD;
      the front of an infiltrating tumor.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a component of the tumor microenvironment, tumor budding is associated with the epidermal&#xD;
      mesenchymal transition of tumor cells and may predict disease progression and poor survival.&#xD;
      The current assessment of tumor budding levels is mainly based on the ITBCC grading system.&#xD;
      The dMMR phenotype of colorectal cancer is associated with the generation of&#xD;
      non-self-recognizing neoantigens by the immune system, with tumor-associated extensive&#xD;
      inflammatory cell infiltration, and often the dMMR phenotype of colorectal cancer has a lower&#xD;
      level of outgrowth, possibly with the generation of local immune responses capable of&#xD;
      eradicating tumor budding cells. The prognostic value of the conventional tumor budding&#xD;
      grading system has been validated mainly in stage I and II colorectal cancers and does not&#xD;
      consider the effect of MMR status on tumor budding. This retrospective study is designed to&#xD;
      investigate whether the high grade of tumor budding under high immune response status implies&#xD;
      immune escape of tumor cells and brings worse survival outcome, establish a more independent&#xD;
      risk grading system to maximize the prognostic value of tumor budding in dMMR phenotype of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer in combination with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.&#xD;
