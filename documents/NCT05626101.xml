  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer (BC) is the tenth most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. Approximately 75%&#xD;
      of patients with BC present with disease confined to the mucosa (stage Ta or CIS) or&#xD;
      submucosa (stage T1); for younger patients (&lt;40 year) this Percentage is even higher (Babjuk&#xD;
      et al., 2022).&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 40%-80% of NMIBC recur within 6-12 months when managed with TURBT alone, and 10%-25% of&#xD;
      the patient's progress to muscle invasive disease. Intravesical therapy enables delivery of&#xD;
      high local concentrations of a therapeutic agent within the bladder, which could potentially&#xD;
      destroy viable tumor cells that remain following TURBT (Ye Z, et al., 2018 and Daneshmand et&#xD;
      al., 2022).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Intravesical BCG injection can reduce the recurrence rate by about 30-40%. For&#xD;
      intravesical therapy, chemotherapy drugs such as mitomycin C, gemcitabine, and epirubicin can&#xD;
      be used post-TURBT, which is a good alternative treatment for BCG or a second-line treatment&#xD;
      (Ansari et al., 2022).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BCG vaccine was firstly developed by Albert Calmette over a hundred years ago. Its effect&#xD;
      on bladder cancer was proposed by Dr. Alvaro Morales about forty years ago. In 1990, BCG was&#xD;
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of NMIBC and then became&#xD;
      the first-line drug in NMIBC up to now (Ansari et al., 2022).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to worldwide shortage of BCG, there is a clinical need to develop novel intravesical&#xD;
      agents and application forms in order to improve the oncological outcomes in non-muscle&#xD;
      invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Gemcitabine has been investigated in various clinical&#xD;
      trials. It has proven to be superior to BCG re-challenge and mitomycin (MMC) in&#xD;
      BCG-unresponsive high-risk NMIBC (Gakis, 2022).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analogue with cytotoxic activity mediated by inhibition of DNA&#xD;
      synthesis followed by cell apoptosis. The majority of trials examining gemcitabine have been&#xD;
      in the setting of prior BCG failure (Balasubramanian et al., 2022).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NMIBC represents a significant global therapeutic challenge, particularly in the era of&#xD;
      international BCG shortage due to manufacturing issues. Induction and maintenance&#xD;
      intravesical BCG remains the historical gold standard for patients with intermediate or&#xD;
      high-risk NMIBC. However, clinicians may be forced to consider alternatives given the current&#xD;
      BCG shortage. Attempts to rationalize its use, including dose frequency reduction, have&#xD;
      resulted in inferior outcome. Accordingly, there is considerable interest worldwide in&#xD;
      assessing alternate approaches to improve oncologic outcomes for patients with NMIBC&#xD;
      (Balasubramanian et al., 2022).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of trials examining gemcitabine have been in the setting of prior BCG failure.&#xD;
      To our knowledge there are only four trials evaluating initial intravesical gemcitabine&#xD;
      without prior BCG usage. Porena et al., 2010 included only 32 patients; Bendary et al. 2011&#xD;
      included 40 patients; Gontero et al., 2013 included 61 patients and Prasanna et al., 2017&#xD;
      included 51 patients. Depending on this fact, we need a well-designed prospective trial&#xD;
      including a large number of patients with reasonable follow-up period to estimate the actual&#xD;
      benefits and hazards of intravesical gemcitabine injection.&#xD;
