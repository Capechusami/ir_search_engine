  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a dietary&#xD;
      intervention to increase choline intake through whole foods (eggs) in pregnant and lactating&#xD;
      women for mental health benefits. We will achieve these goals through the following specific&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effects of including eggs as a source of choline in the diets of&#xD;
           pregnant and lactating women on biomarkers, we will measure concentrations of choline&#xD;
           and choline metabolites in maternal serum and breastmilk at 24-26 weeks gestation and&#xD;
           4-6 weeks postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate adherence to a food-based dietary choline intervention in pregnant and&#xD;
           lactating women, we will track intake via daily photo and written food logs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the feasibility of collecting repeated measures of dietary intake and maternal&#xD;
           depression, anxiety, and stress in the perinatal period, we will track completion rates&#xD;
           for project surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from this study will inform the design and sample size calculations for a&#xD;
      longitudinal cohort study that will assess neurological outcomes for both mother and child&#xD;
      and follow the offspring over time to reassess mental health and cognitive development in&#xD;
      preschool-aged children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choline is an underconsumed nutrient of concern for public health, specifically during&#xD;
      pregnancy and lactation. There is limited data on biomarker or health outcomes related to&#xD;
      perinatal choline intake. Determining relationships between perinatal choline intake and&#xD;
      maternal mental health has the potential to impact public health by ultimately informing&#xD;
      development of nutrition education materials in the clinical setting focused on encouraging&#xD;
      maternal perinatal choline intake through whole foods such as eggs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be recruited from community sites, such as health clinics and recreation&#xD;
      centers. Practitioners and recreation center directors will collaborate by sharing a&#xD;
      recruitment flyer with patients and clients. Doctor's clearance is not required for&#xD;
      participation, but potential subjects may discuss the study with their physician. Potential&#xD;
      subjects will complete an online screening form. Eligible subjects (n=30) will be 18 to 26&#xD;
      weeks pregnant (at study start, mid-July), have access to internet and an electronic devise&#xD;
      (phone, tablet, or computer), and be willing to consume eggs and consent to study&#xD;
      participation. Eligible subjects will be sent an electronic informed consent and be contacted&#xD;
      by study personnel. Study personnel will review the consent either in person, via phone, or&#xD;
      via zoom. Those eligible for the study will be randomly assigned to the dietary intervention&#xD;
      groups: whole liquid eggs (n=15) or plant-based liquid egg substitute (JUST Egg) (n=15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consenting, subjects will complete baseline surveys. Baseline survey data collected&#xD;
      will include an online demographic and health history questionnaire, food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire, 24-hour dietary recall, and self-report surveys to assess depressive symptoms,&#xD;
      anxiety, perceived stress, and perceived social support. Subjects will complete all&#xD;
      assessments online (via Qualtrics) using their own electronic devices, including phone,&#xD;
      tablet, or computer, from the comfort of their own home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then be scheduled to come to the Ramsay Research unit (RRU) for fasted blood&#xD;
      draw (overnight fast, 8 hours). Subjects will be scheduled between 7:30am and 11am. The RRU&#xD;
      is not a CLIA-certified laboratory. It is an approved research laboratory. Blood will be&#xD;
      processed at the RRU and sent to the Chen lab on the UI Moscow campus for cortisol analysis&#xD;
      and to the University of North Carolina Nutrition Research Institute for choline analysis. At&#xD;
      this baseline visit, subjects will also receive the first 30 day supply of the assigned&#xD;
      dietary intervention along with a simple recipe book to offer ideas for preparation in case&#xD;
      subjects are not familiar with how to prepare liquid eggs and to reduce monotony and palate&#xD;
      fatigue. Subjects will also receive a measuring cup and a diet log along with instructions&#xD;
      for consuming the intervention food and reporting intake daily via photos and written log.&#xD;
      Researchers will answer any questions. Subjects will receive baseline data collection&#xD;
      compensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will pick up additional dietary intervention products at the Carmelita Spencer Foods&#xD;
      laboratory every 30 days (total of 120 days). Alternatively, research personnel will deliver&#xD;
      products to subjects' homes in the Moscow area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to take a photo of each meal that incorporates their assigned dietary&#xD;
      intervention food before and after eating. These photos will be sent to the study phone via&#xD;
      text message and uploaded to the PI's secure university One Drive account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to complete additional online 24-hour diet recalls at week 9-10 of the&#xD;
      intervention (about week 35-36 gestation), and week 18-19 of the intervention (about 4-5&#xD;
      weeks postpartum).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 4-6 postpartum, subjects will complete a short survey online describing birth-related&#xD;
      outcomes and experience and self-report surveys to assess depressive symptoms, anxiety,&#xD;
      perceived stress, and perceived social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also at 4-6 weeks postpartum, subjects will come to the Ramsay Research Unit for fasted blood&#xD;
      draw (overnight fast, 8 hours) and to provide a sample of breastmilk. Subjects will be&#xD;
      scheduled between 7:30am and 11am. Subjects will be asked to refrain from feeding their&#xD;
      infant on one breast for the 2 hours prior to collection. An electronic breast pump will be&#xD;
      provided and a lactation specialist will be available to assist in this collection. Subjects&#xD;
      will be asked for a full expression from one breast. Blood will be processed as described&#xD;
      above. Breastmilk will sent to the UNC Nutrition Research Institute for choline analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will complete the data collection and subjects will receive study completion&#xD;
      compensation.&#xD;
