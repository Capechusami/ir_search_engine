  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to test perineural injections (injections around a nerve)&#xD;
      of incobotulinumtoxin-A in participants with diabetic nerve pain of the feet and lower legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the treatment safe and effective?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the treatment affect participants quality of life, depression, physical activity,&#xD;
           daily life, and sensation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be treated every 12 weeks, for a total of 24 weeks, with either&#xD;
      incobotulinumtoxin-A or a placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, investigating the safety,&#xD;
      efficacy, use of rescue medication, and impact on NPSI scores, health-related QoL, activities&#xD;
      of daily living (ADLs) and levels of physical activity of perineural incobotulinumtoxin-A&#xD;
      (iBonT-A) or placebo injections, in persons with DNP of the lower extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned via simple block randomization to receive either 100&#xD;
      units of iBonT-A in each leg (total of 200 units), or a placebo in each leg, injected&#xD;
      perineurally around both distal sciatic nerves once every 12 weeks, for a total of 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injections are performed with sonographic guidance by an experienced operator. Contents of&#xD;
      the blinded vials, containing either 100 U of iBonT-A or a placebo consisting of small&#xD;
      amounts of sucrose and albumin are diluted in 5 ml of sterile saline. The injection point is&#xD;
      just distal to the sciatic nerve bifurcation. The skin is penetrated from the lateral side&#xD;
      using a non-cutting needle (Pajunk, SonoBlock, 22G x 80 mm, Facet S Tip). With the needle in&#xD;
      plane in relation to the ultrasound probe, the nerves are visualized in short axis. The&#xD;
      needle tip is placed inside the common sheath surrounding the tibial and peroneus communis&#xD;
      nerves. The location of the needle tip is verified with small boli of sterile saline solution&#xD;
      in combination with ultrasound. Correct distribution of the injectant is confirmed with&#xD;
      dynamic scanning. Fluid distention must be seen around both components. When confirmation of&#xD;
      optimal needle placement the 100 units iBonT-A or placebo is injected. The procedure is&#xD;
      repeated for both legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to rate their neuropathic pain once a day, as well as register&#xD;
      their daily use of rescue medication. Secondary outcome measures will be rated at baseline&#xD;
      and at 4, 12, 16 and 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety information consists of adverse events recording, as well as motorfunction and sensory&#xD;
      changes over time.&#xD;
