  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: An individualized internet-based treatment program from a biopsychosocial&#xD;
      perspective has been developed within the Västra Götaland region (VGR) with funds from the&#xD;
      Innovation Fund. The treatment program is called Learn to live with migraine and goes by the&#xD;
      abbreviation I AM (Internet Approach to Migraine). I AM is a complement to the medical&#xD;
      treatment and focuses on pain management and learning to live as good a life as possible with&#xD;
      the disease migraine. During the spring of 2022, I AM has been tested regarding the&#xD;
      feasibility of primary care on 29 research subjects in a pilot RCT (DNR 2020-02359). A&#xD;
      weighted preliminary assessment shows moderate effect size on mental health, that the&#xD;
      participants accept the intervention, and that I AM with recruitment and care process can be&#xD;
      carried out in a primary care context. Purpose: An overall purpose of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of the addition of the internet-based biopsychosocial treatment I AM&#xD;
      compared to usual treatment (TREATMENT as usual - TAU) in primary care regarding frequency&#xD;
      and severity of migraine attacks, functional level, mental health, quality of life and&#xD;
      employment rate with a randomized controlled trial design (RCT). An additional aim is to&#xD;
      evaluate whether it is possible to prevent episodic migraine from developing into chronic&#xD;
      migraine among those who have episodic migraine at the start of the study via the supplement&#xD;
      treatment program I AM. Expected results: The greatest expected benefit of I AM is to reduce&#xD;
      the burden and suffering of migraines for all the people affected. AM is also expected to&#xD;
      increase the availability of treatment with a biopsychosocial perspective, have a&#xD;
      quality-enhancing effect in terms of method and increase the patient's participation in their&#xD;
      treatment. An environmental aspect is that neither patient nor therapist need to travel,&#xD;
      accessibility also increases for individuals living in smaller communities who receive equal&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      An overall purpose of the study is to evaluate in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) the&#xD;
      effect of the addition of the internet-based treatment Internet Approach to Migraine (I AM )&#xD;
      compared to usual treatment (Treatment as usual - TAU) in primary care regarding frequency&#xD;
      and severity of migraine attacks, functional level, mental health, quality of life and&#xD;
      employment rate. An additional aim is to evaluate whether it is possible to prevent episodic&#xD;
      migraine, among those who have episodic migraine at the start of the study, from developing&#xD;
      into chronic migraine in primary care via the addition of the I AM treatment program for&#xD;
      migraine, compared to TAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question / Hypothesis Impact evaluation - primary outcomes1. What effect does I AM have, in&#xD;
      comparison with treatment as usual (TAU) regarding the frequency and severity of migraine as&#xD;
      well as functional capacity, mental health and quality of life, in follow-up measurement&#xD;
      after termination, at 6 months after the end of treatment, and at 1 year and 2 years of&#xD;
      follow-up measurement? The hypothesis is that there is an interaction effect and that the&#xD;
      participants in I AM at follow-ups have a significantly lower degree of frequency and&#xD;
      severity of migraine, as well as better functional ability, mental health and quality of&#xD;
      life.2. Is there a significant difference between how many people have developed chronic&#xD;
      migraine (measured by cut off of 15 days a month?) in the I AM and TAU groups, respectively?&#xD;
      The hypothesis being tested is that the frequency and severity of migraine attacks is not&#xD;
      reduced or further developed by the targeted treatment program I AM in comparison with TAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process Evaluation - Secondary outcomes3. What effect does I AM have in comparison to TAU&#xD;
      regarding flexibility and acceptance, selfcompassion, mindfulness, degree of pain&#xD;
      sensitivitization and confidence in one's ability to engage in physical training? How does&#xD;
      the effect of the intervention stand after 6, 12 and 24 months.&#xD;

    <description>I AM has a biopsychosocial perspective. Modules 1-3 and 10 are mandatory and for those who are in need of shorter support and module 1-10 is for those who have more frequent and severe migraines and want a long time of support and treatment. The rationale of the treatment assumes that we do not know why we get migraines and instead focus on becoming as good as possible at managing the migraine attacks. The focus area of the treatments cognitive-behavioral interventions is, among other things, psychoeducation, what migraine is and what happens in the body during migraines and pain, interpretation of symptoms and information processing, training to stop through mindfulness and becoming aware of assumptions that guide behavior during pain management, management of grief, worry, guilt and feelings of shame based on self-compassion, challenging avoidances in a valued direction through ACT interventions and physiotherapist-led cardio training and exercises.</description>
