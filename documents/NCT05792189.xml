  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supracondylar femur periprosthetic fractures about a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are a&#xD;
      catastrophic and challenging complication of TKA and unfortunately are increasing in&#xD;
      incidence. Fixation of these fractures can be challenging due to altered anatomy for the TKA&#xD;
      and the presence of the metallic femoral component and have a relatively high complication&#xD;
      rate. As a result, some surgeons elect to treat these fractures with a distal femur&#xD;
      replacement total knee arthroplasty (DFR). The purpose of this study is to prospectively&#xD;
      evaluate periprosthetic femur fractures treated with ORIF or DFR and compare various outcomes&#xD;
      measures (Get up and go times, KOOS Jr score)&#xD;

      Supracondylar femur periprosthetic fractures about a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are a&#xD;
      catastrophic and challenging complication of TKA and unfortunately are increasing in&#xD;
      incidence. Fixation of these fractures can be challenging due to altered anatomy for the TKA&#xD;
      and the presence of the metallic femoral component and have a relatively high complication&#xD;
      rate. As a result, some surgeons elect to treat these fractures with a distal femur&#xD;
      replacement total knee arthroplasty (DFR). Several small retrospective studies have compared&#xD;
      outcomes with mixed results. To the authors' knowledge there are no prospective studies&#xD;
      evaluating the outcomes after treatment of periprosthetic distal femur fractures. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to prospectively evaluate periprosthetic femur fractures treated with ORIF&#xD;
      or DFR and compare various outcomes measures (Get up and go times, KOOS Jr score).&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will perform the Timed Up and Go Test, This test is used to assess mobility. Subjects are asked to wear regular footwear and can use their walking device as needed. Subjects begin by sitting in a standard armchair. Next participants are instructed to walk 10 feet to a designated line at a normal pace. Once they reach the line they are to turn and walk back to the chair and sit down. The test starts on the study staff go signal and ends once the subject is fully seated in the chair.</description>

    <description>Subjects will complete the KOOS Jr assessment. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a self-reported outcome measure assessing the patient's opinion about the health, symptoms, and functionality of their knee. It is a 42-item questionnaire, including 5 subscales: symptoms, pain, ADLs, sports/recreation, and quality of life. The maximum score a patient can achieve is 100, indicating no knee problems. The minimum score is zero, indicating severe knee problems.</description>
