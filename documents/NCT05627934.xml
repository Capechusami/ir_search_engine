  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A serious and life-threatening complication to rectal surgery is anastomotic leakage, AL. In&#xD;
      Denmark, approximately 800 patients every year, are operated for rectal cancer, 50% of these&#xD;
      with resection and anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registered leakage rate for rectal anastomosis is 10-15%. AL can be life threatening and&#xD;
      has long-term adverse effects for the patients, with reduced quality of life, due to a poor&#xD;
      functional result of the neo-rectum known as low anterior rectal syndrome (LARS). Fistulas to&#xD;
      the vagina or urinary tract are other severe complications. Furthermore, AL is associated&#xD;
      with an increased risk of reccurence1. Finally, the AL-associated morbidity is also a&#xD;
      significant economic burden to the health care system due to prolonged hospital stay,&#xD;
      medicine, and reoperations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery it is important to ensure optimal healing conditions for the anastomosis. The&#xD;
      blood flow is evaluated by colour and pulsation in the mesentery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies suggest that it might be easier to evaluate the perfusion using fluorescent dye. This&#xD;
      evaluation is a subjective evaluation, based mostly on the surgeon's experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing fluorescence by computer-based software, qICG, has been developed. But cut-off&#xD;
      values for sufficient blood flow to diminish the risk of leakage, has not yet been defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To establish cut-off values of qICG, where blood flow assumes sufficient&#xD;
      for healing, and thereby reduce the risk of leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To identify which long-term complications grade A, B and C leakages&#xD;
      entails on Quality of Life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-operative evaluation To evaluate which impact disease and treatment has on overall&#xD;
      morbidity, patients will be asked to fill questionnaires regarding quality of life and bowel&#xD;
      function prior to surgery. The validated EORTC-qlq-cr29 and LARS questionnaires will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These questionnaires will be repeated post-operatively on POD 365.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICG and anastomotic evaluation Patient characteristics will be noted according to&#xD;
      registration form 1. All patients must undergo laparoscopic or robotic rectal resection,&#xD;
      possibly combined with trans-anal approach. After the bowel has been resected and the anvil&#xD;
      of the circular stapler has been placed in the proximal bowel, the ICG-FI evaluation will&#xD;
      take place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon will place the camera in a stationary holder or in the robotic arm at the optimal&#xD;
      position to view the bowel perfusion. The camera, patient, operating table, or bowel shall&#xD;
      not be moved during observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A bolus of 0,2mg/kg ICG, max 25mg, is administered intravenously and flushed with saline. The&#xD;
      laparoscopic light is switched from white to infra-red and then the ICG-solution is infused.&#xD;
      This procedure will be video-documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the anastomosis has been established, leakage-test and visual evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed. All intra-operative observations will be registered according to registration form&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative observation Patients will be observed daily according to standard&#xD;
      post-operative care. On post-operative day (POD) 5 an abdominal CT scan with rectal enema&#xD;
      will be performed to identify all AL, including subclinical. Findings will be registered&#xD;
      according to registration form 3. If we find a leakage on CT, a flexible endoscopy will be&#xD;
      performed (observations will be registered according to registration form 4). Findings will&#xD;
      be addressed according to normal practice in participating centres; surgery, endoscopic&#xD;
      lavage, treatment with endosponge and/or antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On POD 30 and 90, any complications will be noted from the electronic patient records,&#xD;
      according to registration form 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative and on POD 365 the patients will be sent a questionnaire or online survey about&#xD;
      their functional symptoms and quality of life, using the validated EORTC-qlq-cr29&#xD;
      questionnaire and the LARS score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      q-ICG: Videos will postoperatively be analysed using the pixel analysis software q-ICG. We&#xD;
      will evaluate the following parameters: Slope, normalized slope, TTP (Time-To-Peak=Tmax), T0&#xD;
      (first fluorescent sign), T1/2max, TR (Time Ratio: T1/2max/Tmax), and Fmax (Maximum&#xD;
      fluorescent value), see registration form 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Videos should be recorded in MP4 format or AVI format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient related data, findings and questionnaires will be entered into a RedCap database&#xD;
      powered by OPEN - Open Patient data Explorative Network&#xD;
