    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase 2 study designed to explore the efficacy and safety of low-dose&#xD;
      PTCy-ruxolitinib GVHD prophylaxis in older adults undergoing allogeneic HCT with a matched&#xD;
      sibling or unrelated donor with a peripheral blood stem cell graft.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following reduced intensity conditioning and 8/8-matched peripheral blood transplant on Day&#xD;
      0, all patients will receive a GVHD prophylaxis post-transplant composed of the following:&#xD;
      (i) cyclophosphamide administered at 25 mg/kg on Day +3 and +4, (ii) tacrolimus beginning on&#xD;
      Day +5 and through Day +180 and administered with a trough target of 5-10 ng/ml through Day&#xD;
      +90 and tapered thereafter; (iii) mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) administered at 15 mg/kg thrice&#xD;
      daily beginning on Day +5 through Day +35; and (iv) ruxolitinib administered at 5 mg twice&#xD;
      daily starting after engraftment (between Days +30 and +60) and continuing through one year&#xD;
      post transplant.&#xD;
