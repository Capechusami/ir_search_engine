      Providing more theoretical basis for the prediction of the efficacy of advanced NSCLC and&#xD;
      helping select better advantaged population of NSCLC immunotherapy to maximize the benefits&#xD;
      of patients By exploring the relationship between the changes of PD-1 expression in&#xD;
      peripheral blood T lymphocytes and the clinical efficacy before and after the use of PD-1 /&#xD;
      PD-L1 inhibitors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From the perspective of immunology, it is intended to explore whether the expression of PD-1&#xD;
      in peripheral blood T lymphocytes can be used as a reference index for selecting immune &quot;+&quot;&#xD;
      therapy in patients with advanced HCC, and to clarify the relationship between the expression&#xD;
      level of peripheral blood T lymphocytes and the survival data of patients receiving immune&#xD;
      &quot;+&quot; therapy. And explore whether there is consistency between the expression level of PD-L1&#xD;
      and that of PD-L1 on patients. At the same time, to explore whether there is a correlation&#xD;
      between the distribution of T cell subsets and the efficacy of immunotherapy, so as to&#xD;
      provide a new theoretical basis for the clinical screening of the target population of immune&#xD;
      &quot;+&quot; therapy and a new clinical screening index for the prognosis assessment of patients.&#xD;
