      The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of local anesthetic and tramadol&#xD;
      combinations in the prevention of pain after the surgical extraction of third molars.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The surgical removal of impacted third molar teeth is a procedure that is frequently&#xD;
      encountered in oral and maxillofacial surgery practices. Pain following these operations is&#xD;
      one of the most important factors affecting patient satisfaction. Several pain-management&#xD;
      strategies are available. An alternative approach to pain control is to maximize drug levels&#xD;
      at the tissue injury site by administering drugs locally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tramadol is a centrally acting opioid that provides good analgesia. It reduces the&#xD;
      transmission of pain impulses by inhibiting serotonin and norepinephrine re-uptake. In&#xD;
      addition to the systemic analgesic effects, the local anesthetic effects of tramadol on the&#xD;
      peripheral nerves have been presented in multiple clinical and laboratory studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test the clinical efficacy of local anesthetic and tramadol&#xD;
      combinations during and after the surgical extraction of the lower third molars.&#xD;
