    <textblock>
      The present study is a prospective case-control study. Patients were enrolled post lung&#xD;
      transplantation and alveolar lavage fluid was obtained within 48 hours of the patient's&#xD;
      surgery, divided into aliquots and subjected to macrogenomic sequencing, routine&#xD;
      microbiological testing and cytokine testing. Patients were divided into pulmonary infection&#xD;
      and non-pulmonary infection groups based on whether they had a co-infection at the time of&#xD;
      sampling. Pulmonary infection was used as the primary study endpoint. To describe and compare&#xD;
      the characteristics of the lung microbiota in the two groups and to determine whether&#xD;
      variation in the lung microbiota could predict the development of lung infection and&#xD;
      prognosis in patients in the early post-transplant period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung infection is a common and serious problem in the perioperative period of lung&#xD;
      transplantation, and early diagnosis of lung infection is important, while traditional&#xD;
      culture methods are time-consuming and have low positivity rates. Pathogenic detection by&#xD;
      macro-genomic sequencing (mNGS) may be useful for early and rapid diagnosis of post-operative&#xD;
      infections, and the simultaneous detection of lower respiratory tract microbiota may also be&#xD;
      useful for early diagnosis of infections. However, the use of lung microbiota in the&#xD;
      perioperative period of lung transplantation in the setting of pulmonary infections is still&#xD;
      at an exploratory stage. The present study is a prospective case-control study. Patients in&#xD;
      the MICU after lung transplantation were enrolled, and alveolar lavage fluid was obtained&#xD;
      within 48 hours of the patient's surgery, divided into aliquots, and subjected to&#xD;
      macrogenomic sequencing, routine microbiological testing and cytokine testing. Patients were&#xD;
      divided into pulmonary infection and non-pulmonary infection groups based on whether they had&#xD;
      a co-infection at the time of sampling. Pulmonary infection was used as the primary study&#xD;
      endpoint. To describe and compare the characteristics of the lung microbiota in the two&#xD;
      groups and to determine whether variation in the lung microbiota could predict the&#xD;
      development of lung infection and prognosis in patients in the early post-transplant period.&#xD;
      To explore the diagnostic thresholds of common lung pathogens by macrogenomic sequencing in&#xD;
      patients with co-infections in the early post-transplant period&#xD;
