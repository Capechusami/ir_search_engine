  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Bisphosphonates has been associated with a decreased risk of revision total joint&#xD;
      replacements because of its effects on decreased periprosthetic bone loss and prosthetic&#xD;
      migration. However, the results in the early literature are inconsistent and the influence of&#xD;
      bisphosphonates on associated complications and subsequent total joint arthroplasty (TJA)&#xD;
      remains unknown. This study is to investigate the association between the use of&#xD;
      bisphosphonates and risk of adverse outcomes after primary TJA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods This matched cohort study utilized National Health Insurance Research&#xD;
      Database in Taiwan to identify patients who underwent primary TJA over a 15-year period&#xD;
      (January 2000- December 2015 inclusive). Study participants were further categorized into two&#xD;
      groups: bisphosphonates users and nonusers, using propensity score matching. The Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      curve analysis and adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of revision surgery, adverse outcomes of&#xD;
      primary surgery and undergoing subsequent TJA were calculated using Cox regression analysis.&#xD;
