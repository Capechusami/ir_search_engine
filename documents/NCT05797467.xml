  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial] is to compare in resectable stage T3-4N2 colorectal cancer.&#xD;
      The main question it aims to answer is: whether the use of targeted therapy in combination&#xD;
      with adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with improved disease-free survival (DFS) compared&#xD;
      to adjuvant chemotherapy alone.&#xD;

    <description>When evaluating the safety and tolerability of adjuvant therapy, researchers typically assess adverse events (AEs) based on their incidence and severity, and then grade them according to the NCI CTCAE version 5.0. NCI CTCAE 5.0 categorizes AEs into 5 grades based on severity, including grade 1 (mild), grade 2 (moderate), grade 3 (severe), grade 4 (life-threatening), and grade 5 (death).</description>

    <description>Targeted therapy regimens are recommended based on gene testing results. For colorectal cancer patients with KRAS/NRAS/BRAF gene mutations, it is recommended to use Bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy. For right-sided colon cancer patients with wild-type KRAS/NRAS/BRAF genes, it is recommended to use Bevacizumab. For left-sided colon and rectal cancer patients with wild-type KRAS/NRAS/BRAF genes, it is recommended to use Cetuximab.When using targeted therapy in combination with chemotherapy, the treatment course should be synchronized with chemotherapy (Bev 5mg/kg iv d1 or Cet 500mg/m2 iv d1).</description>
