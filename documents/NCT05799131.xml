  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and performance of the QBX stent system in the&#xD;
      treatment of PAD by reporting of peri- and postoperative complications, including major&#xD;
      adverse vascular events (MAVE), Vascular Access Site Complications (VASCs) and bleeding at&#xD;
      puncture site, and by evaluating the prevalence of Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR),&#xD;
      amputations, procedural success, device performance, reduction in percentage diameter&#xD;
      stenosis post-procedure compared to pre-procedure, artery patency, return to normal activity,&#xD;
      Rutherford and Fontaine classification, quality of life (QoL), Ankle Brachial Index (ABI),&#xD;
      and hospital- and patient-related costs in a prospectively maintained database.&#xD;

    <description>The QBX Stent System is a flexible, balloon expandable stent, made of a cobalt chromium alloy manufactured by QualiMed Innovative Medizinprodukte GmbH. The design is suitable for peripheral vessel diameters from 5 to 10 mm.&#xD;
The QBX Stent System is available as 6F and 5F variations where the 6F system is mounted on an 0.035&quot; over-the-wire delivery system, and the 5F is mounted on an 0.018&quot; over-the-wire delivery system. Both are available in a full range of diameters and lengths.</description>
