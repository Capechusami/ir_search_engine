  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure causes significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in Navajo Nation.&#xD;
      There are well-established evidence of improved mortality and lower heart failure&#xD;
      hospitalizations with certain pharmacotherapies for heart failure with reduced ejection&#xD;
      fraction (HFrEF). However, these medications are underutilized nationally, including in the&#xD;
      Indian Health Service which is one important driver of poor heart failure outcomes.&#xD;
      Therefore, as part of an EHR-based pragmatic clinic trial, we are implementing and testing a&#xD;
      model that identifies American Indian HFrEF patients receiving care at one large Indian&#xD;
      Health Service Site who meet clinical criteria for, but are not on appropriate therapy, and&#xD;
      implement a model in which our study team will get patients on appropriate therapy while also&#xD;
      supporting primary care providers with cardiology telementorship. We will evaluate the impact&#xD;
      of this model to improve uptake of GDMT among HFrEF patients.&#xD;
