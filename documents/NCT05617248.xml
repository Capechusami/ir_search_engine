  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the effects of a digital, scalable self-efficacy training of repeated&#xD;
      recall of self-efficacy memories on mental health outcomes, such as self-efficacy, anxiety,&#xD;
      stress, hopelessness, and other mental health outcomes. A total of 94 students with elevated&#xD;
      stress levels (≤ 13 on the Perceived Stress Scale) will be recruited and randomly assigned to&#xD;
      training and control group. Individuals will either engage in the self-efficacy training app&#xD;
      combined with Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) for 1 week (training group) or in EMA&#xD;
      only for 1 week (control group). Baseline and post assessments will measure changes in&#xD;
      self-efficacy, anxiety, stress, hopelessness, and other mental health outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self-efficacy is associated with positive mental health outcomes and has been proposed as a&#xD;
      putative contributor to therapeutic outcomes in the treatment of mental health problems. It&#xD;
      can be enhanced through experimental inductions and the recall of autobiographical mastery&#xD;
      experiences, which have mostly been conducted in person and in the laboratory until today.&#xD;

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and negative affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily measured; changes in the course of the study participation</time_frame>
    <description>EMA will capture positive and negative mood at 10 time points per day during the one week study participation. We will measure positive mood using three items (cheerful, happy, and relaxed) and negative mood using seven items (irritated, anxious, insecure, lonely, sad, overthinking, and stressed).</description>

    <description>EMA will capture dissatisfaction with social contacts at 10 time points per day during the one week study participation. There will be two options indicating dissatisfaction with social contacts: (a) being with nobody and feeling excluded or wanting to be with someone or (b) being with someone and rather wanting to be alone. We combined these into one variable.</description>
