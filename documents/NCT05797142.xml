      This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of relaxation exercise with VR (Virtual&#xD;
      Reality) glasses on pain severity, anxiety level, physiological symptoms of anxiety and&#xD;
      satisfaction in patients undergoing endoscopy.&#xD;

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Before endoscopy)</time_frame>
    <description>The patients were asked to mark their level of pain during relaxation or activities on a 10 cm vertical or horizontal line. In addition, there were forms which were numbered from 1-10 or from 1-100. The number 0 is found at the beginning of the line, and the number 10 is located at the end of the line. A value of 0 shows that there is no pain, and the value 10 expresses unendurable pain. GAS is a common scale in the assessment of pain level. A patient is asked to mark the perceived pain on this line, and the marked point is measured in cm.</description>
