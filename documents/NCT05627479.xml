  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 2 randomized control trial will be to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) therapy in the setting of lower extremity trauma to reduce&#xD;
      short- and long-term muscle damage, acute rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury. The study&#xD;
      will consist of 40 patients with femur or tibial shaft fractures randomized to the GIK arm&#xD;
      (using a well-described systemic GIK protocol; n = 20) or the control arm (using isotonic&#xD;
      saline; n = 20). The use of systemic GIK is expected to decrease the overall amount of lower&#xD;
      extremity muscle cell death and result in improved muscle function in the postoperative&#xD;
      period. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that GIK will lead to less severe&#xD;
      rhabdomyolysis and a concomitant decrease in the incidence of AKI that results from the&#xD;
      byproducts of muscle cell death.&#xD;

    <description>In patients randomized to the GIK Therapy Arm, a stepwise GIK infusion process will be performed. Baseline lab values that are markers of skeletal muscle injury (CPK), acute kidney injury (creatinine), and general tissue perfusion (lactate) will be obtained within the first 30 min of arrival to the ED. Subsequently, serial CPK, creatinine, myoglobin and lactate values will be obtained at regularly scheduled intervals until a minimum of 72 hours after definitive fixation or until rhabdomyolysis is resolved and/or kidney function has normalized</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the control cohort will receive a normal saline infusion instead of GIK. Standard institutional ICU protocol will be used to monitor potassium and glucose levels per current standard-of-care practices and abnormal lab values will be treated accordingly per standard institutional protocols.</description>
