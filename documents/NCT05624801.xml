      In this research project, the investigators want to find out whether the additional intake of&#xD;
      vitamin D further reduces the inflammatory events in the intestines of IBD patients. There&#xD;
      are three groups of subjects: the 1st group takes a capsule of 24,000 IU per week, the 2nd&#xD;
      group takes 24,000 IU per month, the 3rd group is the control group. The intake extends over&#xD;
      6 months during the autumn and winter period.&#xD;

      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are a chronic immunologically mediated inflammatory&#xD;
      condition of the gastrointestinal tract comprising two clinical entities: ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      and Crohn's disease. Genetic,environmental and microbial factors, and the immune responses&#xD;
      play an important role in the disease development. The incidence and prevalence of IBD have&#xD;
      increased in the past 50 years in the Western world and are increasing in developing&#xD;
      countries. Faecal calprotectin is a reliable biomarker for functional quantitative&#xD;
      measurement of intestinal inflammation in IBD. Faecal calprotectin test is recognized to be&#xD;
      reliable in clinical practice for the assessment of endoscopic activity and remission.&#xD;
      Vitamin D or cholecalciferol is a prohormone classified as a fat-soluble vitamin. The&#xD;
      organism can produce the substance itself in the skin during summer time. The importance of&#xD;
      vitamin D for the regulation of calcium metabolism, for bone formation, for the treatment of&#xD;
      osteoporosis and for the prevention of falls and associated fractures is generally&#xD;
      recognized. Vitamin D seems to play a role in the pathogenesis of many diseases,including&#xD;
      IBD. Several observational studies showed an inverse correlation between 25(OH)D and disease&#xD;
      activity. Vitamin D deficiency is common among patients with IBD. The relapse rate in&#xD;
      patients with Crohn' disease and 25(OH)D &lt;50 nmol/l is almost doubled. There is a significant&#xD;
      inverse correlation between serum 25(OH)D levels and the specific inflammatory marker faecal&#xD;
      calprotectin. The lowest serum 25(OH)D levels have been reported in patients with a more&#xD;
      severe disease progression or previous ileum resection. Low 25(OH)D serum concentrations are&#xD;
      associated with more frequent IBDassociated surgeries and hospitalisations. However, no&#xD;
      intervention studies have been conducted to date that have investigated the influence of&#xD;
      vitamin D on inflammation in adult IBD patients. An intervention study with subjects aged&#xD;
      5-18 years nevertheless showed a statistically significant inverse correlation between&#xD;
      25(OH)D serum concentration and the inflammation marker calprotectin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FOPH Expert Commission recommends a daily intake of 600 IU for adults aged 19-59 years,&#xD;
      800 IU for &gt;60 years. The maximum tolerable intake for all age groups is 4'000 IU daily, with&#xD;
      daily or cumulative intermittent, weekly or monthly, administration being considered.&#xD;
      Adherence is, however, better with intermittent intake. In this study, the administration to&#xD;
      patients with monthly supplementation represents one capsule per month, corresponding to 800&#xD;
      IU cholecalciferol daily. The administration to patients with weekly supplementation is one&#xD;
      capsule per week, corresponding to 3,500 IU cholecalciferol daily. The cumulative&#xD;
      administration of 24'000 IU per week does not exceed the upper limit of 4'000 IU per day or&#xD;
      28'000 IU per week. Insufficient adherence to IBD medication has been identified as&#xD;
      responsible for therapy escalation with more expensive regimens, disease complication or&#xD;
      hospitalization, that all drive substantial costs. In a systematic review including 93'998&#xD;
      patients with IBD, adherence rate to prescribed biologics ranged from 37% to 96%.&#xD;
      Difficulties with medication adherence can be identified with indirect methods such as&#xD;
      questionnaires. To monitor adherence, questionnaires and pill-count are the most frequently&#xD;
      used methods. However, more robust methods are recommended such as electronic methods. One&#xD;
      option is the use of a e-pill bottles with electronic caps. The opening of the e-pill-bottle&#xD;
      that corresponds to the withdrawal of a medicine from the container is registered with a time&#xD;
      stamp, a method currently in development in our research group.&#xD;
