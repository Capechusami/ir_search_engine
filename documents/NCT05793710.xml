  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laughter programs are safe, affordable, and age-appropriate activities. Few studies have&#xD;
      utilized mixed study designs to look at the impact on resilience in and experiences of&#xD;
      participants in such activities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The laughing qigong program is a physical and mental practice program that combines qigong&#xD;
      and laughter. It is influenced by Chinese local culture. It emphasizes the transformation of&#xD;
      voice, body, and emotional use so that people can experience relaxation and tranquility, and&#xD;
      then the transformation of emotions so that physical and mental energy can be released then&#xD;
      to achieve balance. Our research has shown that laughter-related psychological interventions&#xD;
      have consistent effects on mental health, reducing mood conditions under life stress (Grace,&#xD;
      2013), depressed mood (Hsieh et al., 2015), and cortisol concentration (Grace, 2013).&#xD;
      However, there have only been a few studies where similar protocols focused on positive&#xD;
      mental states (e.g. resilience, well-being) and the application of laughing in immune&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the current quasi-experimental trial was to investigate the effects of the LQP on&#xD;
      psychological outcomes (resilience and well-being), mucosal immunity (salivary immunoglobulin&#xD;
      A, s-IgA), and immune-inflammatory index (interleukins, IL-6) amongst breast cancer&#xD;
      survivors. We hypothesized that (a) experimental group participants would have significantly&#xD;
      higher levels of resilience and well-being at baseline (before the test) and post-treatment&#xD;
      (post-test) compared to the wait list control group; (b) Compared to the control group on the&#xD;
      wait list, experimental group participants will have significant differences in mucosal&#xD;
      immunity (s-IgA) and inflammatory index (IL-6) before and after the test; and (c)&#xD;
      experimental group membership had a significant effect on psychological outcomes (resilience&#xD;
      and well-being) as well as mucosal immunity (s-IgA) and immune-inflammatory indices (IL-6)&#xD;
      after a 12-week LQP intervention&#xD;

    <description>This scale is used to assess an individual's resilience to setbacks. There is a total of 25 items. For each item, the Likert five-point scale is used, with scores ranging from 1 (extremely dissatisfied) to 5 (extremely satisfied) (very satisfied). The higher the score, the more resilient to frustration. The scale was divided into five items, the higher the score, which are a meaningful life, a peaceful mind, self-confidence, an indomitable spirit, and acceptance of the loneliness of existence (Wagnild, &amp; Young, 1993).The psychometric evaluation of this scale supports its internal consistency reliability and concurrent validity as a good tool for measuring resilience (Wagnild, &amp; Young, 1993), and the scale has also been translated into Chinese and demonstrates good reliability (α=0.91) and validity.</description>

    <description>The basic method of &quot; LQP &quot; is the principle of laughter plus Qigong, combined with the sound of laughter, stretching the body, thereby activating the parasympathetic nerve, so that the body can automatically relax, and at the same time guide the individual to face their own emotions when facing pressure, and transform emotions into positive energy or relieve negative emotions through practice, so as to achieve the energy balance of body, mind and spirit.</description>

    <intervention_name>The principle of laughter plus Qigong</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention program include muscle stretching, breathing exercises, and closing exercises. The laughing practice method begins with a warm-up consisting of laughing to stretch the body, yawning, and exerting the voice, and ends with expelling all the &quot;qi&quot; in order to return to natural movements and return to taking care of your body and mind (He et al., 2021).&#xD;
The LQP program meets once a week for 90 minutes and runs for 12 weeks. The program content: the laughter skills were 50-60 minutes, the feedback was 30 minutes, and relaxation was 10 minutes.</description>
