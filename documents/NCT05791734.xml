  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the 2013 guidelines of the French Society for Hospital Hygiene (SF2H), it is&#xD;
      recommended to carry out at least one preoperative shower, with an antiseptic soap or a mild&#xD;
      soap as close as possible to the operation. This preoperative shower aims to eliminate dirt&#xD;
      and make the skin clean to facilitate the subsequent action of the antiseptic in the&#xD;
      operating theatre. Thus, detersion is no longer carried out systematically but is only&#xD;
      recommended in the presence of soiled skin. The preoperative shower, and the verification of&#xD;
      its effectiveness, therefore become essential steps in the preoperative skin preparation.&#xD;
      Indeed, the cleanliness of the skin influences the quality of the antisepsis performed in the&#xD;
      operating theatre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual assessment of preoperative skin cleanliness by the nurse is currently the reference&#xD;
      technique. However, a qualitative pilot study (Consiglio et al., Rech Soins Inf 2021) of nine&#xD;
      obese patients and eleven surgical nurses revealed a lack of visual verification of skin&#xD;
      cleanliness, which caregivers found difficult to perform. In a second multicentre study of&#xD;
      430 patients (Boulet et al., under review by Nursing Open), only 17% reported visual&#xD;
      verification of skin cleanliness. Thus, this initial work highlights a barrier for caregivers&#xD;
      to visually check preoperative skin cleanliness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ATPmetry method was initially developed to assess the cleanliness of surfaces. In a&#xD;
      second phase, the manufacturer (Hygiena®) showed through a study of 20 professionals that&#xD;
      this method also allowed the evaluation of skin cleanliness of hands after washing. This&#xD;
      method would have the advantage of being objective, potentially improving acceptability to&#xD;
      caregivers and patients compared to direct visual inspection of skin cleanliness. Thus,&#xD;
      ATPmetry appears to us as a method of interest for assessing preoperative skin cleanliness,&#xD;
      but needs to be validated for this indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is no other method than the simple subjective visual skin assessment by the&#xD;
      caregiver, which is highly exposed to a bias of non-reproducibility and inter-observer&#xD;
      variability.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate a simple and objective method of measuring preoperative skin&#xD;
      cleanliness (by swabbing and ATPmetry), in order to eventually standardise this method for&#xD;
      routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reproducibility of the ATPmetry measurement will be assessed as well as its concordance&#xD;
      with two other methods (visual skin inspection and visual swab inspection). An statistical&#xD;
      analysis will assess its agreement with each of the other two methods, as compared to the&#xD;
      agreement between the two methods.&#xD;
