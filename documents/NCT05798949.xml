  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is a condition that is dominated by invalidating neuropathic&#xD;
      pain. Pharmacological neuropathic pain treatment is often disappointing, since pain reduction&#xD;
      is mostly slight and side effects can be debilitating. Although neuropathic pain is caused by&#xD;
      a lesion of the somatosensory system, also psychological factors, such as fear and&#xD;
      catastrophizing, appear to play a role in the origin and maintenance of disability in chronic&#xD;
      pain. Rehabilitation based on pain education and cognitive behavioral treatment including&#xD;
      elements of acceptance and commitment therapy, exposure in vivo or graded activity can be&#xD;
      performed to influence these factors. To date no specific rehabilitation programs are&#xD;
      available for patients diagnosed with SFN.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) presents with neuropathic pain and autonomic dysfunction, caused&#xD;
      by damage of the myelinated AÎ´- and unmyelinated C-fibers. Neuropathic pain in SFN is chronic&#xD;
      and severe. In 47% of the SFN cases, an underlying cause can be found. The diagnosis of SFN&#xD;
      is established on the clinical signs and symptoms, in combination with reduced&#xD;
      intra-epidermal nerve fiber density in the skin biopsy and/or abnormal quantitative sensory&#xD;
      testing, with no abnormalities in the nerve conduction test (no large fiber involvement).&#xD;
      Without underlying cause or when causative treatment is not sufficient, the treatment is&#xD;
      focused on symptomatic neuropathic pain relief. Nevertheless, current pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment is not sufficient enough in pain relief. In less than 50% of the pain patients,&#xD;
      pain reduction of 30-40% has been observed with the most potent analgesia. Besides the lack&#xD;
      of effectiveness of pharmacological medication, side effects and abuse are reported. These&#xD;
      insufficient treatment options of SFN enables the necessity to search for other possible&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treatment of (chronic) pain disability, a biopsychosocial approach seems to be&#xD;
      effective in reducing disability and quality of life (QOL) in SFN. As we know based on&#xD;
      earlier studies, chronic (neuropathic) pain, such as SFN, is influenced by several&#xD;
      psychological factors, especially in causing and perpetuating pain. First, catastrophizing is&#xD;
      one of those disabling psychological factors, which is defined as exaggerated negative mental&#xD;
      set brought to bear during actual or anticipated pain experience Catastrophizing is seen as a&#xD;
      precursor of pain, rather than consequence. Evidence showed a relation between the severity&#xD;
      of chronic neuropathic pain and catastrophizing. Pain catastrophizing has been correlated to&#xD;
      pain intensity, independent of physical impairment. In chronic pain, negative and&#xD;
      catastrophic thoughts about illness often increase the level of disability. It seems that&#xD;
      catastrophizing is one of the factors influencing QOL. Second, fear is another disabling&#xD;
      psychological factor. Fear of pain can result in avoidance behavior and reduction of daily&#xD;
      activities. Avoidance is the behavior aimed at postponing or preventing an aversive situation&#xD;
      from occurring, which are mostly seen as a threat. According to the basic fear avoidance&#xD;
      (conditioning) model, chronic pain and disability are induced by behavior. Neutral stimulus&#xD;
      receives a negative load. In daily activities, these stimuli will remind patients to the&#xD;
      painful experiences and so predicting pain. The intensity of pain combined with psychosocial&#xD;
      factors can result in escape and avoidance behavior with eventually an impact for the level&#xD;
      of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These factors can be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which aims to change&#xD;
      the behavior, mindset, or feelings of the patient, helping to experience less distress,&#xD;
      enjoying more and being more productive. Varying CBT modalities exists: exposure in vivo,&#xD;
      acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), and graded activity (GA), which will be discussed.&#xD;
      All the mentioned modalities will be provided by a treatment team consisting of a&#xD;
      psychologist and an occupational therapist, whom both are experienced in the modalities of&#xD;
      CBT. For every patient an individualized program will be designed based on the results of a&#xD;
      screening. First, a patient will receive education about disabling factors that interfere&#xD;
      with functioning in their personal situation. Thereafter, an individual treatment plan&#xD;
      containing elements that specifically target disabling factors in the patient's situation&#xD;
      will guide further treatment. Additional treatment elements can be based on three cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral approaches: exposure in vivo, graded activity and acceptance commitment therapy&#xD;
      (ACT). One or more modalities can be combined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main (primary) objective is to test the effectiveness of a personally tailored&#xD;
      rehabilitation treatment targeting the specific psychological and behavioral factors related&#xD;
      to decreasing disability, and improving QOL in SFN. The secondary objective is the personally&#xD;
      tailored rehabilitation treatment program will have decrease of pain intensity, mood, and&#xD;
      pain catastrophizing.&#xD;
