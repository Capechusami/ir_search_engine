      Fucoidan also ameliorates tumour and chemotherapy-induced muscle atrophy and -related&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer cachexia is characterized by anorexia, skeletal muscle atrophy, and systemic&#xD;
      inflammation. Fucoidan extracted from brown algae exhibits anti-inflammatory and anticancer&#xD;
      activities. In addition, fucoidan also ameliorates tumour and chemotherapy-induced muscle&#xD;
      atrophy and -related cachectic symptoms in vivo and in vitro. To evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      fucoidan in cancer cachexia or sarcopenia in cancer patients.&#xD;
