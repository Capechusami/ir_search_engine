  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigator initiated, single-institution, prospective, phase 2 open-label&#xD;
      study to determine the efficacy and safety of combination therapy of atezolizumab/bevacizumab&#xD;
      and proton beam therapy to portal vein tumor thrombosis with or without main primary tumor in&#xD;
      patients with stage 3 or higher hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with Vp2-4 portal vein&#xD;
      invasion who had not undergone systemic therapy for HCC. The primary endpoint of this study&#xD;
      is progression-free survival and secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS), time to&#xD;
      progression (TTP), objective response rate, disease control rate (DCR), and time to local&#xD;
      disease progression (LTP).&#xD;
