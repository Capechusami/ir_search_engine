  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single center retrospective cohort study of all inpatient endoscopy procedures to asses&#xD;
      factors associated with inpatient endoscopy delays and impact on length of stay and 30-day&#xD;
      readmission&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Delays in inpatient endoscopy planning negatively influence the quality and&#xD;
      accessibility of care. This may result in higher healthcare costs, negative health outcomes,&#xD;
      and unnecessary readmissions and use of hospital beds. Additionally, prolonged hospital stay&#xD;
      is associated with poorer health outcomes and risk of nosocomial infections, amongst others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To asses factors associated with inpatient endoscopy delays and impact on length&#xD;
      of stay and 30-day readmission&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single center retrospective cohort study of all inpatient endoscopy procedures&#xD;
      (gastroscopy, colonoscopy, ERCP, sigmoidoscopy) during 2016-2022. Data will be identified and&#xD;
      extracted using CTCue. Only pseudonymized data will be used. Inpatient endoscopy delay will&#xD;
      be defined as the number of days between the planned date versus the actual date.&#xD;
      Multivariable logistic regression models will be performed to assess factors associated with&#xD;
      inpatient endoscopy delay.&#xD;

        with an admission of at least two days between 1-1-2014 and 1-12-2022 AND an endoscopic&#xD;
        care activity.&#xD;
