  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effects of the use of a simple, reliable and&#xD;
      cost-effective puzzle on post-operative cognitive function changes, postoperative recovery,&#xD;
      and quality of life using questionnaires and face-to-face interview techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aging is a process involving biological, physiological and psychological changes. With aging,&#xD;
      deterioration in brain, behavior and cognitive functions is observed. In this process,&#xD;
      physical and cognitive deficiencies and slow thinking can be seen. The independence of&#xD;
      elderly individuals in meeting their self-care decreases. Over time, individuals become&#xD;
      unable to meet their needs and this reduces the quality of life of individuals. With the&#xD;
      developing technology, perioperative care techniques began to develop and the number of&#xD;
      surgical procedures applied to elderly patients began to increase.One of the most important&#xD;
      goals in the field of health today and in the future will be to increase the quality of life&#xD;
      of individuals. It is becoming increasingly important to determine the effective factors to&#xD;
      protect cognitive functions in elderly individuals.After surgical procedures, patients may&#xD;
      experience memory loss and decrease in concentration. Symptoms indicating a decrease in&#xD;
      cognitive functions were named as postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Compared to other&#xD;
      individuals undergoing surgery, the rate of cognitive changes in the early period is higher&#xD;
      in the elderly.Especially, elderly patients who underwent orthopedic surgery are thought to&#xD;
      be a risky patient group for postoperative cognitive impairment.Solving jigsaw puzzles is a&#xD;
      low-cost, motivating, visuospatial cognitive-challenging activity.This study will be&#xD;
      conducted in order to determine the effect of this strain on the cognitive functions of the&#xD;
      individual and to investigate the effect of focusing on completing the puzzle on&#xD;
      post-operative recovery and quality of life, as it will focus the individual's perception on&#xD;
      a certain point.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1st, 2nd and 3rd days after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>1st, 2nd and 3rd days after the surgery, the puzzle will be applied to the patients once a day. Then the Standardized Mini-Mental Test will be applied to the patients.This test is a measurement tool that can be easily administered within 5-10 minutes, does not include questions about mental processes, and focuses only on cognitive processes.The Standardized Mini Mental Test consists of 11 items under 5 main headings: orientation (10 points), attention and calculation (5 points), recording (3 points) and recall memory (3 points) and language (9 points). It is evaluated out of 30 points. The increase in the score obtained from the test indicates that the severity of cognitive destruction decreases.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Postoperative Recovery by the Postoperative Recovery Index</measure>
    <time_frame>3rd day after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative Recovery Index will be applied on the 3rd postoperative day. Postoperative Recovery Index consists of 5 sub-dimensions and 25 items. Sub dimensions; psychological symptoms, physical activities, general symptoms, intestinal symptoms, and craving-desire symptoms. While determining the sub-dimension score, the scores of the related items are summed and their arithmetic averages are taken. For the total score; All items are summed and the arithmetic average is taken. It states that the higher the scores obtained from the index, the more difficulty in post-operative recovery, and the easier the post-operative recovery as the scores decrease.</description>

    <measure>Change of Quality of Life by Quality of Life Scale in Older People (CASP-19)</measure>
    <time_frame>3rd day after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life Scale in Older People (CASP-19) will be applied on the 3rd postoperative day. The scale consists of 19 items and four sub-dimensions. These sub-dimensions are control, autonomy, pleasure, and self-actualization. Each item of the original scale was graded as a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from &quot;never&quot; (0 points) to &quot;always&quot; (3 points). Scale items are scored between 0 and 3 points. An increase in the score obtained from the scale indicates an increase in the quality of life.</description>

Then, Patient Diagnosis Form, Mini-Mental State Test and Quality of Life Scale will be administered.On the 1st, 2nd and 3rd days after the surgery, the rules of the puzzle will be reminded again and the puzzle will be applied to the patients once a day. After the puzzle application on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd days after the surgery, the Mini-Mental State Test will be applied to the patients. Postoperative Recovery Index and Quality of Life Scale will be applied on the 3rd postoperative day.</description>
