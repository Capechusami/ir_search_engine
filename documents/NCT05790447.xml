    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, Phase II investigator-initiated trial of precise&#xD;
      thymalfasin-regulated therapy combined with hypofractionated radiotherapy, PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      inhibitor sequential GM-CSF for treatment of advanced refractory solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One cycle of activation cycle includes： Loading dose with thymalfasin was administrated based&#xD;
      on the absolute number of T lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy (5 or 8Gy three fractions)was administrated to a metastatic lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GM-CSF 200ug was subcutaneous injected for seven days from the first day of radiotherapy&#xD;
      PD-1/L1 inhibitor was intravenous injected within one week after radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least two activation cycles were administrated. Then maintenance treatment includes：&#xD;
      Loading dose with thymalfasin was administrated based on the absolute number of T&#xD;
      lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GM-CSF 200ug was subcutaneous injected for seven days. PD-1/L1 inhibitor was intravenous&#xD;
      injected.&#xD;
