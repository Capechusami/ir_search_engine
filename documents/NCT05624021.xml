  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Work-related musculoskeletal disorders have been rising fast around the globe leading to neck&#xD;
      pain and scapular muscle dysfunction, contributing to a decrease in neck movements and&#xD;
      functional limitations. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of scapular functional&#xD;
      exercise (SFE) in combination with cervical isometric exercises (CIE) on neck pain, cervical&#xD;
      range of motion, and functional limitations among participants with chronic mechanical neck&#xD;
      pain.The study was based on a two-arm parallel group pretest-posttest randomized control&#xD;
      trial design. Thirty participants (females 21 and males 9; average age 28.94Â±3.77 years) were&#xD;
      randomly allocated to groups A and B (n=15/group). The group's A and B participants received&#xD;
      a common intervention, such as CIE and hot packs. However, group A received the SFE in&#xD;
      addition to common interventions. The outcomes, such as neck pain, cervical ROM, and&#xD;
      functional limitations, were evaluated using a numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), standard&#xD;
      universal goniometer, and neck disability index questionnaire at baseline and 4-week&#xD;
      post-intervention. The paired and unpaired t-test was used to analyze the intervention&#xD;
      effects on the outcomes within-group and between-group, keeping the significance level alpha&#xD;
      set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesised that adding the scapular functional training to the cervical isometric&#xD;
      exercises will be equally effective than cervical isometric exercises alone on managing neck&#xD;
      pain, cervical ROM, and functional limitations among participants with chronic mechanical&#xD;
      neck pain. The present study is helpful for chronic mechanical neck pain patients and&#xD;
      physiotherapist to better understand the effect of incorporation of the scapular functional&#xD;
      training in the treatment of neck pain. Therefore, this protocol may be used as a treatment&#xD;
      in chronic mechanical neck pain because it alleviates pain, neck disability, improving&#xD;
      cervical range of motion in chronic mechanical neck pain.&#xD;

    <description>Neck pain was assessed by a nuemeric pain rating scale. It is an 11-points numeric scale marked with 0 to 10 between either end. Zero at one end and ten at the opposite end indicate no pain and unbearable/worst imaginable pain, respectively. The participants were asked to rate their current level of pain, as well as their worst and least amounts of pain in the past 24 hours.</description>

    <intervention_name>Scapular functional training</intervention_name>
    <description>The scapular functional training consists of press up and push up plus. Press up was done in sitting position on the training bench, feet on the floor with straight arm and the palms on the edge of the bench fingers pointing forward and then lift off and dip down just in front of the seat by moving the shoulder girdle. Progression is done by placing weight on the thigh. Push-up plus exercise started from a push up position on the hand, feet or knees and keeping the torso rigid by bracing the abdominals followed by protracting the scapula as high as possible. Progression is done moving from knees to the feet or adding resistance on the upper back. The training continued for three sessions per week for four weeks.</description>

    <description>The isometric neck exercises taught to all the participants to perform in neutral sitting positions at home thrice a day for 15-days continuously. The sequences of exercises were shoulder circling in clockwise and anticlockwise direction, scapular retraction with cervical retraction, neck flexion, extension, either side of lateral bending/flexion, left and right rotation. Each exercise follows a set of 10 repetition of maximum voluntary contraction with a progressive hold time of 3, 5, 7, and 10 seconds depending on the severity of pain and tolerance of the participants.</description>
