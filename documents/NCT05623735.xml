  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether the effectiveness of instrument-assisted soft&#xD;
      tissue mobilization technique is different from passive prone lying when performed with a&#xD;
      functional exercise in individuals with chronic nonspecific low back pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals participating in the study will first be divided into two groups by&#xD;
      randomization. While IASTM (Instrument Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization Techniques) will be&#xD;
      applied to one group in the prone position, IASTM will be applied to the other group with&#xD;
      functional exercise. The pain, mobility, flexibility, disability and endurance parameters of&#xD;
      the individuals assigned to the groups after randomization will be determined just before the&#xD;
      application, immediately after the 1st application and immediately after the 6th application.&#xD;
      The study will last for a total of 6 sessions, with two sessions per week for 3 weeks.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals' pain levels will be measured using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) both at rest and during activity. It will be requested to mark any point on a horizontal line of 10 cm length such that 0 no pain, 10 unbearably severe pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mobility (Modified Schober Test)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals' spinal mobility will be assessed using the Modified Schober Test. While the patient is standing, the midpoint between the spina iliaca posterior superior is marked. This point is considered the L4-L5 level. Two more points are marked 10 cm above and 5 cm below this point. This distance will be measured both while standing and by asking them to bend forward without bending the knees, with the hands touching the feet.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Flexibility (Sit and Reach Test)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A measuring bench with a length of 55 cm in the upper part, 35 cm in the lower part, 32 cm in height and 45 cm in width will be used. The soles of both lower extremities will be fully touching the bench with bare feet and the patient will be asked to lie on the bench with knees extended straight and hands on top of each other. The level of the feet will be the 0 point on the table at the top. It will be recorded in such a way that it extends forward +, lagging behind -. The test will be calculated by taking the best value of the measurements after 3 consecutive repetitions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Flexibility (Maximal Hip Flexion Active Knee Extension (MHFAKE))</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hamstring flexibility will be measured using the Active Knee Extension Test with Maximal Hip Flexion (MHFAKE). It has been reported to be the best measure of hamstring flexibility compared to traditional straight leg raises or other tests. While the individual is lying in the supine position, he will be asked to take the hip of the tested extremity to its maximal flexion and lock it with his hands, then actively bring the knee to the extension position until it reaches the maximal tension it can reach. The contralateral limb will be extended straight on the bed. To prevent variations, the contralateral extremity will be fixed to the bed from the distal thigh with a belt. Knee angle will be measured with a goniometer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability (Oswestry Disability İndex)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Turkish version of the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire consisting of 10 questions will be used in order to measure the loss of function caused by low back pain. These questions are; It consists of questions compatible with daily life activities such as pain intensity, personal care, lifting/carrying, walking, sitting, standing, sleep, travel, social life, and degree of pain change. Higher scores mean more disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trunk Extensors Muscle Endurance (Biering-Sorenson Test)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The trunk extensors muscle endurance of individuals will be evaluated with the Biering Sorenson test. Individuals will be asked to lie face down on the bed and extend their torso out of the bed from the anterior superior iliac spine (SIAS). A rolled towel will be placed in front of the ankle and their legs will be supported by the physiotherapist. Individuals will be asked to stand with their hands crossed in the pectoral region and keep their torso parallel to the ground against gravity. The time will be recorded in seconds.</description>

    <description>The application will take a total of 6 sessions, with two sessions per week for 3 weeks.&#xD;
While individuals are lying in the prone position, the IASTM protocol will be applied bilaterally on the erector spinae and then on the hamstrings. The application will take approximately 17 minutes.</description>

    <description>While standing in the &quot;extended child pose (utthita balasana)&quot; stance, the &quot;IASTM&quot; protocol will be applied bilaterally on the lumbar erector spines, with the hands on them and moving back to the old position. Then, the &quot;IASTM&quot; protocol will be applied bilaterally on the hamstrings by making consecutive knee flexion-extension up to 90 degrees while the individuals are lying prone.&#xD;
The application will take approximately 17 minutes.</description>
