  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electrogastrogram (EGG) is a non-invasive method for recording myoelectric activities by&#xD;
      placing electrodes on the abdomen surface. Many studies suggested EGG measures the gastric&#xD;
      slow wave frequency effectively; the relative change in EGG signal amplitude would reflect&#xD;
      the contractility of the stomach. Thus, this technique is used to study the&#xD;
      pathophysiological processes of diseases such as functional dyspepsia and many more .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to study the EGG pattern in healthy individuals in Indian population&#xD;
      and the factors associated with it.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electrogastrogram [EGG] is an authentic method to detect gastrointestinal diseases&#xD;
      accompanied by gastric motility abnormalities . The present study would help to determine the&#xD;
      normatic values of EGG in healthy population and EGG changes in patients with idiopathic&#xD;
      gastroparesis. This pilot study would provide findings/abnormalities seen in study population&#xD;
      and may be helpful in providing a comparative data for proper treatment and a better quality&#xD;
      of life patients suffering from dyspepsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the eligible subjects will undergo study procedure i.e. EGG. The study procedure will&#xD;
      conduct as per standard study protocol. EGG is a non-invasive, painless method for the&#xD;
      measurement of gastric myoelectrical activity. EGG takes around two hours to complete the&#xD;
      procedure and no side effects reported. Following steps are included in the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject lie on back on a procedure table.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator or technician tapes electrodes to Subject's abdomen (belly). The electrodes&#xD;
           are similar to those used for other tests, such as an ECG (electrocardiogram). The&#xD;
           electrodes measure electrical signals coming from stomach muscles. They send the signals&#xD;
           to a computer that records the signals as a graph.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator or technician records a test while Subject's stomach is empty. An hour&#xD;
           later, Subject have something to eat and drink. Investigator or technician then records&#xD;
           a second test. The test and electrodes are painless.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The electrodes are removed. EGG test is completed at this point.&#xD;
