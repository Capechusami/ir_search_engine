      Urinary tract infection is a common infectious disease in clinic. Although urinary tract&#xD;
      infection can be initially diagnosed by clinical sign and symptom, signs and urine routine,&#xD;
      the application of appropriate antibiotic therapy depends on the further identification of&#xD;
      pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metagenomic sequencing has been widely used in clinical pathogen diagnosis, especially in&#xD;
      difficult infectious diseases. ICompared with tissue samples, cerebrospinal fluid,&#xD;
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, whole blood and other samples, the application of mNGS in urine&#xD;
      samples is relatively limited because incorrect sampling methods before and after collection&#xD;
      of urine samples are easy to contaminate the samples and the colonization of distal urethra,&#xD;
      periurethral skin and vagina will interfere with the interpretation of reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous small sample studies have shown that the sensitivity of mNGS in urinary tract&#xD;
      infection is high, but the specificity is relatively low, and there are many problems such as&#xD;
      difficult interpretation of reports and low clinical conformity. This is closely related to&#xD;
      the mNGS technology algorithm, such as the inability to eliminate the influence of urinary&#xD;
      system background bacteria, and the ambiguity of short sequence alignment, which makes it&#xD;
      difficult to distinguish homologous pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, based on the standard mNGS sequencing process, the improved Z value analysis&#xD;
      method was used to select strictly enrolled clinical samples and compare them with pathogen&#xD;
      culture to observe the clinical value of mNGS with Z value analysis method in the treatment&#xD;
      of urinary tract infection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infection is a common infectious disease in clinic. Urinary tract infection is&#xD;
      easily caused by abnormal structure and function of urinary system, low immunity, pregnancy,&#xD;
      gender and sexual activity, and iatrogenic factors. Urinary tract infection has a wide&#xD;
      spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms, including Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive cocci,&#xD;
      fungi, mycoplasma, chlamydia, viruses and so on. Although urinary tract infection can be&#xD;
      initially diagnosed by clinical sign and symptom, signs and urine routine, the application of&#xD;
      appropriate antibiotic therapy depends on the further identification of pathogens. At&#xD;
      present, it is commonly used to collect midstream urine for pathogen culture in clinic, but&#xD;
      it has the disadvantages of time-consuming and low detection rate, and the use of antibiotics&#xD;
      can affect the results of culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metagenomic sequencing has been widely used in clinical pathogen diagnosis, especially in&#xD;
      difficult infectious diseases. Its principle is to collect samples, use mNGS to process the&#xD;
      samples before sequencing, expose the nucleic acid, compare the nucleic acid sequence of&#xD;
      pathogens with the designated huge biological database, and realize the comprehensive&#xD;
      detection of viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites and atypical microorganisms. Compared with&#xD;
      tissue samples, cerebrospinal fluid, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, whole blood and other&#xD;
      samples, the application of mNGS in urine samples is relatively limited because incorrect&#xD;
      sampling methods before and after collection of urine samples are easy to contaminate the&#xD;
      samples and the colonization of distal urethra, periurethral skin and vagina will interfere&#xD;
      with the interpretation of reports. However, mNGS has obvious advantages in clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis, with high specificity and accuracy, and shorter detection time than traditional&#xD;
      culture. In the aspect of mixed infection, because of its non-bias, the detection rate of&#xD;
      multiple pathogens is higher than that of conventional culture, smear, PCR and other tests,&#xD;
      which can detect other pathogens and even rare pathogens that can not be detected&#xD;
      conventionally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous small sample studies have shown that the sensitivity of mNGS in urinary tract&#xD;
      infection is high, but the specificity is relatively low, and there are many problems such as&#xD;
      difficult interpretation of reports and low clinical conformity. For example, there are many&#xD;
      pathogens with high reading, and the test results are sorted to form a list of pathogens, but&#xD;
      it is impossible to determine which or which pathogens are pathogenic. This is closely&#xD;
      related to the mNGS technology algorithm, such as the inability to eliminate the influence of&#xD;
      urinary system background bacteria, and the ambiguity of short sequence alignment, which&#xD;
      makes it difficult to distinguish homologous pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, based on the standard mNGS sequencing process, the improved Z value analysis&#xD;
      method was used to select strictly enrolled clinical samples and compare them with pathogen&#xD;
      culture to observe the clinical value of mNGS with Z value analysis method in the treatment&#xD;
      of urinary tract infection.&#xD;
