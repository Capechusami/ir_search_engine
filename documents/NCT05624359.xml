  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-craniotomy pain remains a major challenge in patient care following&#xD;
      neurosurgery.Flurbiprofen axetil (FA), as an injectable nonselective cyclooxygenase&#xD;
      inhibitor, is a widely prescribed NSAID for postoperative pain. As FA is highly lipophilic by&#xD;
      merging into emulsified lipid microspheres, it has a high affinity to the surgical incision&#xD;
      and inflammatory tissues to achieve targeted drug therapy and prolonged duration of action,&#xD;
      thus providing a basis for its local use to achieve efficacy and safety comparable to or&#xD;
      greater than systemic administration. In this study, we attempt to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      effects of FA as an adjunct to ropivacaine in pre-emptive scalp infiltration to prevent or&#xD;
      reduce pain after craniotomy.&#xD;
