  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults experience high psychological stress due to many factors such as school, workplace, or&#xD;
      personal life. Adult women are known to experience higher stress levels than men. Current&#xD;
      evidence shows that fasting improves mental health outcomes in men. The research is unclear&#xD;
      on fasting interventions and their potential impact on stress levels in women. In this study,&#xD;
      investigators will compare two fasting diets over 8 weeks. There will be a control group, one&#xD;
      group that fasts for two days per week, and a final group that only eats for 8 hours in the&#xD;
      morning. Mental health surveys, brain tests and a blood draw will be done during the study to&#xD;
      see any mental or physical changes from the diets. Investigators will study the motivation of&#xD;
      women to continue the diet during and beyond the study through online surveys.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) Questionnaire - Stress Sub-Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will administer the standardized DASS-21 Questionnaire at Week 0 and Week 8. The stress sub-scale will be used to measure any potential effects of fasting interventions on psychological stress over time.&#xD;
The scoring of answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale. 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale. Scores range from 0-42, higher scores are indicative of higher psychological stress levels.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Colour and Word Stroop Test (SCWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will administer the standardized SCWT at Week 0 and Week 8 to assess the potential effects of fasting interventions on selective attention and response inhibition in participants over time.&#xD;
This task requires participants to name the displayed colour of the presented words while they disregard the meaning of the words.&#xD;
Several outcome measures will be produced:&#xD;
Reaction time (RT) in milliseconds (ms)&#xD;
The Stroop Effect - the difference in RT between incongruent and congruent trials, which can be broken down into 2 components:&#xD;
Stroop interference effect - the RT difference between incongruent and neutral trials&#xD;
Stroop facilitation effect - the RT difference between the neutral and congruent trials</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will administer the standardized MST to assess the potential effects of fasting interventions on high interference memory over time.&#xD;
Several outcome measures will be produced:&#xD;
Reaction time&#xD;
High-interference memory (assessed as the ability to correctly identify lure items as ''Similar'')&#xD;
General recognition memory performance (assessed as the ability to correctly identify repetitions items as ''Old'')</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will administer the standardized PSQI at Week 0 and Week 8 to measure the self-reported quality and patterns of sleep in adults.&#xD;
Several outcomes will be measured:&#xD;
Subjective sleep quality&#xD;
Sleep latency&#xD;
Sleep duration&#xD;
Habitual sleep efficiency&#xD;
Sleep disturbances&#xD;
Use of sleeping medication&#xD;
Daytime dysfunction over the last month&#xD;
The scoring of answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale. 3 reflects the negative extreme on the Likert Scale. Scores range from 0-21, where higher scores are indicative of poorer sleep quality and a global score of &gt;5 is indicative of poor sleep quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q 6.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will administer the standardized EDEQ-6.0 during screening and Week 8 to measure self-reported disordered eating patterns in adults and the potential effects of fasting interventions on this outcome measure over time.&#xD;
2 main outcomes will be measured:&#xD;
Frequency data on key behavioural features of eating disorders in terms of the number of episodes of the behaviour.&#xD;
Sub-scale scores reflect the severity of characteristics of eating disorders. The sub-scales are Restraint, Eating Concern, Shape Concern and Weight Concern.&#xD;
Generally, sub scales are measures on a 7-point Likert scale. Higher scores on the global scale and sub-scales denote more problematic eating behaviours and attitudes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Profile of Mood States (POMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will administer the standardized POMS at Week 0 and Week 8 to measure the potential effects of fasting interventions on self-reported quality and patterns of sleep in adults over time.&#xD;
Several outcomes will be measured:&#xD;
Total Mood Disturbance [TMD] (-32 to 200)&#xD;
Subscales:&#xD;
Anger (0-48)&#xD;
Confusion (0-28)&#xD;
Depression (0-60)&#xD;
Fatigue (0-28)&#xD;
Tension (0-36)&#xD;
Vigour (0-32)&#xD;
The scoring of answers is based on a 5-point Likert scale (not at all - extremely). Higher TMD scores are indicative of a poorer mood state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>State Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will administer the standardized STAI at Week 0 and Week 8 to measure the potential effects of fasting interventions on self-reported state and trait anxiety levels over time.&#xD;
All items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale (e.g., from &quot;Almost Never&quot; to &quot;Almost Always&quot;), with higher scores indicating greater anxiety levels.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will administer the standardized FFMQ at Week 0 and Week 8 to measure the potential effects of fasting interventions on the self-reported trait-like tendency to be mindful in daily life. It is comprised of the following five related facets: observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging, and non-reactivity.&#xD;
The 39 items of the FFMQ are rated on a 5-point Likert scale: ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true). Facet scores can also be combined to produce an overall mindfulness score.&#xD;
A higher score indicates a greater trait-like tendency to be mindful in daily life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
