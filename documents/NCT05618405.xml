  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will examine the effect of general anesthesia and surgery on&#xD;
      sleep duration and sleep quality in children, using questionnaires and a sleep diary.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess the effect of general anaesthesia and surgery on sleep&#xD;
      duration (chronotype) and sleep quality in children aged 1-11 years in the first week after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to determine the duration of the effect of general anaesthesia on&#xD;
      chronotype and sleep quality. Furthermore, the investigators will examine factors which may&#xD;
      be of influence on the quality and duration of sleep, like postoperative emergence delirium,&#xD;
      admission to the hospital, Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale (FLACC) / Numeric&#xD;
      Rating Scale (NRS) scores, preoperative sedative medication and postoperative sedative&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible participants will be identified on the anaesthetic pre-operative assessment clinic&#xD;
      and asked if they object to a phone call with information about research. If not, a&#xD;
      researcher will contact the parents by telephone to inform them about the study. After oral&#xD;
      consent by both parents, an invitation to fill in the questionnaires will be sent to the&#xD;
      parents together with a consent form. Informed consent by both parents will be obtained.&#xD;
      Questionnaires can be completed online or on paper, depending on the parents' preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep quality: Child's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) on day 3 preoperative and on&#xD;
           day 7 postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronotype: Children's chronotype questionnaire on day 3 preoperative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily sleep diary starting from 3 days preoperative until 7 days postoperative&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following items will be extracted from the electronic health record:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic criteria: age, gender, type of procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission dates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative sedative medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative sedative medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NRS/FLACC scores during hospital stay All items will be entered in an electronic&#xD;
           database (CASTOR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint The diurnal phase shift the night after surgery, measured by comparing the&#xD;
      midpoint of sleep three nights before surgery (as measured by the sleeping log) with midpoint&#xD;
      of sleep the night after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in sleep quality as measured with the CSHQ questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of postoperative sleep problems as measured with the CSHQ questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference in sleep problems, sleep duration and sleep quality between children who had&#xD;
           anaesthesia for magnetic resonance imaging and children who had anaesthesia and surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Influence of pain and sedative medication on sleep duration and quality&#xD;

    <description>The change in subjective sleep quality, including incidence of sleep problems (e.g. sleepwalking, nightmares), as measured by the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ), between the month prior to 3 nights pre-anesthesia and 1 week post-anesthesia.
