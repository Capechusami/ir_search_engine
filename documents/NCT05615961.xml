  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to investigate the use of probiotics (LAB4 probiotics, Cultech, Port&#xD;
      Talbot, Wales, UK) and the effect this has on gastrointestinal symptoms experienced during&#xD;
      elite long-distance triathlon (ironman) competition, as well as the composition of the gut&#xD;
      bacteria in the athlete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-distance triathlon events frequently induce gastrointestinal discomfort due to the&#xD;
      duration of the event (8-17 hours), the intensity of the exercise and the ingestion of large&#xD;
      amounts of sugars throughout the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from athletes participating at the Kona ironman World-championships.&#xD;
      Participants will supplement with either probiotic tablet, or placebo (sugar-pill) for&#xD;
      4-weeks prior to competition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Athletes will be both male and female age-group athletes from any qualifying age category&#xD;
      (age categories are as follows: 18-24; 25-29; 30-34; 35-39; 40-44; 45-49; 50-54; 55-59;&#xD;
      60-64; 65-69; 70-74; 75-79; 80-84).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main investigation of the study will be the occurence/frequency/severity of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms during training and competition between groups.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit ironman triathletes who have qualified for the Kona ironman&#xD;
      World-championships in Hawaii. Participants will be allocated into either probiotic (Lab4&#xD;
      Probiotics, Cultech, Port Talbot, Wales, UK) or placebo (Maltodextrin) groups, in a&#xD;
      double-blind fashion (Blinded by supplement supplier).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those recruited into the study will have their training load and gut symptoms monitored for&#xD;
      8-weeks prior to competition via the completion of online questionnaires (previously&#xD;
      validated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four-weeks prior to competition participants will provide a stool sample for microbiome&#xD;
      analysis, they will then proceed to supplement with probiotic or placebo for 4-weeks. 24-h&#xD;
      prior to competition they will provide a stool sample as well as providing a sample from the&#xD;
      first bowel movement post-race, which will be used for microbiome analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected for pre-race and raceday nutrition, as well as outcome measures for&#xD;
      raceday performance and gastroitestinal symptoms experienced, again via online questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool samples will be analysed by an independent laboratory that specialises in microbiome&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures will be the composition of the gut bacteria and the metabolites&#xD;
      (substances produced) of the gut bacteria at baseline, pre-race and post-race. As well as the&#xD;
      occurrence (frequency, duration, severity) of gastrointestinal symptoms during training and&#xD;
      competition.&#xD;
