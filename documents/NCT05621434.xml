      Studies H0648g and M77001 confirmed that the combination of trastuzumab with taxanes&#xD;
      significantly improved TTP and OS, establishing the status of trastuzumab combined with&#xD;
      taxanes as first-line standard therapy.The CLEOPATRA and PUFFIN studies confirmed that&#xD;
      trastuzumab combined with pertuzumab achieved PFS of 18.7 and 16.5 months, respectively, and&#xD;
      became today 's first-line standard regimen for advanced HER2 + breast cancer. Pyrotinib acts&#xD;
      on the intracellular segment of HER2 receptor and can inhibit tumor cell growth by covalently&#xD;
      binding to the ATP binding site in the intracellular tyrosine kinase region and blocking the&#xD;
      activation of downstream signaling pathways. The mechanism of action of the macromolecular&#xD;
      drug trastuzumab combined with the small molecular drug pyrotinib dual-target in the&#xD;
      treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer is complementary and has a synergistic anti-tumor&#xD;
      effect. In 2022, the ESMO conference reported the results of a phase III trial of pyrotinib&#xD;
      combined with trastuzumab combined with docetaxel in advanced HER2-positive breast cancer&#xD;
      with an LBA, with the primary endpoint of investigator-assessed PFS.The results showed a&#xD;
      significant 59% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared with 10.4&#xD;
      months in the trastuzumab plus docetaxel arm and 24.3 months in the pyrotinib arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inetetamab is a monoclonal antibody against the IV domain of the HER2 receptor with the same&#xD;
      Fab segment as trastuzumab and different amino acid sequences from trastuzumab at positions&#xD;
      359 and 361 of the Fc segment heavy chain constant region, Antibody-dependent cell-mediated&#xD;
      cytotoxicity (ADCC) was 1.11-fold higher than trastuzumab. PFS reached 11.1 months in the&#xD;
      first-line subgroup analysis of the Phase III registration study of Inetetamab (HOPES study),&#xD;
      which was similar to historical data from trastuzumab first-line treatment of HER2-positive&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer, with comparable safety. The results of this study contribute to&#xD;
      further understanding the efficacy and safety of first-line treatment with Inetetamab&#xD;
      Combined with Pyrotinib and Chemotherapy in HER2-positive recurrent/metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      This Prospective, multicenter study will include 63 patients with first-line patients with&#xD;
      HER2-positive recurrent/metastatic breast cancer. After providing written informed consent,&#xD;
      patients receiving Inetetamab in combination with pyrotinib and investigator 's choice&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The effectiveness of the combined treatment will be evaluated by MRI every two&#xD;
      treatment cycles. If the disease progresses, the participant will withdraw from the trial.&#xD;
