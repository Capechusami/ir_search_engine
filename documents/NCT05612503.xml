  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has been designed to investigate the effect of 12 weeks of using virtual reality&#xD;
      based exercises on pulmonary functions, exercise capacity, functional performance, and&#xD;
      quality of life in children with surgically-repaired congenital diaphragmatic hernia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with CDH have significant disruptions in their quality of life (QoL) due to their&#xD;
      poor health, in this randomized controlled clinical trial, one important aspect of virtual&#xD;
      reality is the interactivity of children and their interests in choosing the exercised game.&#xD;
      Each child in two groups perform a specific virtual reality based respiratory exercises for 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
