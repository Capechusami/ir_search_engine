  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Patients undergoing surgical operations in prone position do not have a measure&#xD;
      of intra abdominal pressure as a standard procedure. Many of them could have elevated values&#xD;
      of this parameter and could be exposed to possible renal damage due to a stiffening of the&#xD;
      abdominal muscles while being positioned prone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of study: Intraoperative intrabdominal pressure measurement and evaluation of&#xD;
      correlation with possible postsurgical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Electronic device able to measure intra abdominal pressure is connected between&#xD;
      a Foley catheter and a urinary collecting bag. During the procedure, values of the intra&#xD;
      abdominal pressure are displayed on a monitor next to anaesthetic machine in real time. The&#xD;
      numbers representing the pressure in mmHG are assessed and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Possible correlation between intra abdominal hypertension and postsurgical&#xD;
      complications in patients operated in prone position could be a foundation to further&#xD;
      clinical trials and presurgical assessment of intraabdominal pressure.&#xD;
