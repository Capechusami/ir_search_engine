  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Existing data suggest that both trauma and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are very&#xD;
      common among individuals with psychosis. The presence of PTSD symptoms in psychosis is&#xD;
      associated with worse clinical outcomes and poorer social functioning. However, PTSD is a&#xD;
      poorly attended and poorly studied condition among this population. Research to date&#xD;
      indicates that trauma-focused treatments are safe and effective for PTSD, even when psychotic&#xD;
      comorbidity is present. Recent systematic reviews of psychological interventions for trauma&#xD;
      in psychosis found that are effective in reducing trauma symptoms, suggesting that they&#xD;
      should be implemented in front-line services. Nonetheless, larger confirmative trials are&#xD;
      required to form robust conclusions.The aim of this project is to examine the efficacy of&#xD;
      comprehensive third-generation protocol for people with comorbid trauma and psychosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial at psychiatric rehabilitation services of the&#xD;
      Public Network of Care for people with serious mental disorders. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      participants receiving the intervention, in comparison with controls, will show a reduction&#xD;
      in general, PTSD and psychotic symptomatology, an improvement in levels of functioning and&#xD;
      well-being, a greater ability to regulate emotions with more help-seeking behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the complexity of both psychosis and PTSD and the reluctance of professionals to treat&#xD;
      it, we plan to develop a precise comprehensive protocol. In order to address all issues&#xD;
      associated with both psychosis and comorbid PTSD, the protocol will be developed following&#xD;
      the three stages of recovery from trauma: first, focusing on establishing the therapeutic&#xD;
      alliance and safety; second, focusing on recounting and re-processing the traumatic event;&#xD;
      and third, focusing on reconnecting with others and with life despite the trauma experienced.&#xD;
      The therapy will be adapted to the characteristics of people with SMD and administered in 11&#xD;
      90-minute individual sessions per week, combining strategically ACT, Mindfulness, EMDR as&#xD;
      well as Positive Psychology interventions.&#xD;
