  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) distraction, compared to&#xD;
      book distraction and no distraction, in reducing pain and anxiety during a medical procedure&#xD;
      in a pediatric population: the skin prick test. Although this test has many advantages and is&#xD;
      considered to be minimally invasive, it causes anxiety and painful discomfort in children.&#xD;
      This study concerns children aged 4 to 7 years consulting for an allergic test. Outcome&#xD;
      measures include pain score, level of anxiety, VR measures, and satisfaction questionnaires.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of skin prick tests is considered a gold standard in the evaluation of allergic&#xD;
      reactions. These tests involve depositing a drop or small amount of the allergen on the skin&#xD;
      and pricking the skin to let the allergen penetrate the epidermis. Although this test has&#xD;
      many advantages and is considered to be minimally invasive, it causes anxiety and painful&#xD;
      discomfort for children. Managing pain and anxiety during skin prick testing is essential to&#xD;
      prevent long-term adverse effects, especially in the case of future needle-stick&#xD;
      interventions. To our knowledge, the studies investigating distraction methods effect on&#xD;
      reducing anxiety and pain during skin prick tests in childrenremain limited. No study has yet&#xD;
      investigated the value of VR as a distraction tool in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We postulate a greater decrease in child pain and child and parent anxiety in the RV and book&#xD;
      conditions compared to the control group. We also postulate a larger effect for the RV group&#xD;
      compared to the book group. In the VR group, we postulate the absence of an increase in&#xD;
      post-immersion cybersickness symptoms. In last, we postulated a good satisfaction to&#xD;
      distractions proposed, with a best score for RV distraction.&#xD;

    <description>Child's behavioral pain assessment during skin prick testing. Measured with Face Legs Activity Cry Consolability (FLACC) that is behavioral pain assessment scale used for nonverbal or preverbal patients who are unable to self-report their level of pain.
