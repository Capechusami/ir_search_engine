  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to compare preemptive single-dose selective cyclooxygenase&#xD;
      2 (COX-2) inhibitor - etoricoxib and dexamethasone use in systemically healthy patients&#xD;
      during the surgical extraction of impacted mandibular third molars. The main questions it&#xD;
      aims to answer/evaluate are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the level of inflammatory and early wound healing mediators in patients' saliva during&#xD;
           early postoperative phase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  clinical postoperative parameters such as pain, swelling and trismus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient satisfaction with the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rescue medication consumed during the postoperative period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  incidence of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants indicated for mandibular third molar surgery will be asked to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  take premedication (etoricoxib or dexamethasone) before surgical extraction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  provide saliva samples before and following the surgery at regular check-ups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  note the amount of rescue medication taken and pain intensity in different time points&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  perform clinical measurements of swelling and trismus at regular check-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  answer the questions about satisfaction and potential adverse events, if occur&#xD;
           Researchers will compare preemptive single-dose etoricoxib, preemptive single-dose&#xD;
           dexamethasone, and no premedication in impacted mandibular third molar surgery, to see&#xD;
           if there are differences in inflammatory response and early wound healing, as well as in&#xD;
           clinical postoperative parameters, patient satisfaction with the treatment and incidence&#xD;
           of potential adverse events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute pain, swelling and trismus present typical clinical manifestation following impacted&#xD;
      mandibular third molar surgery. Postoperative wound healing is regulated by activity of&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators and osteogenic factors. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,&#xD;
      especially cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitors and glucocorticoids are routinely used to&#xD;
      improve postoperative clinical state of the patients. Studies have shown that both COX-2&#xD;
      inhibitors and dexamethasone may decrease the number of postsurgical rescue medication&#xD;
      intake, reduce the postoperative edema and increase the mouth opening ability. Analgesic&#xD;
      efficacy of etoricoxib (ETOX), a high selective COX-2 inhibitor has been shown as superior&#xD;
      compared to placebo and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in third molar surgery.&#xD;
      However, literature data on comparative testing of ETOX and dexamethasone (DEX) use in third&#xD;
      molar surgery are scarce. Furthermore, no studies with a 7 days follow-up were conducted.&#xD;
      Preclinical studies indicate that COX-2 inhibitors and DEX may negatively affect early wound&#xD;
      healing by down-regulation of mediators such as COX-2, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase (ALP), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), and osteocalcin (OCN).&#xD;
      Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators are important for resolution phase of inflammatory&#xD;
      process and wound healing. According to animal studies, maresin 1 (MAR1) has important role&#xD;
      in post-trauma pain reduction and bone healing, thus the expression of this mediator may be&#xD;
      significant to indicate the course of postoperative wound healing. In the current literature,&#xD;
      no data on salivary early bone healing mediators following preemptive use of ETOX and DEX in&#xD;
      mandibular third molar removal are available. Moreover, the correlation of these markers, as&#xD;
      well as inflammatory saliva mediators with the clinical parameters may be important for&#xD;
      potential developing of future unique protocols for premedication in third molar surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the research will be to evaluate the level of inflammatory and early&#xD;
      wound healing mediators (COX-2, PGE2, ALP, RUNX2, OCN, MAR1) in saliva samples obtained from&#xD;
      the systemically healthy patients requiring impacted mandibular third molar extraction, in&#xD;
      conditions of 1-preemptive single-dose ETOX 90 mg oral use; 2-preemptive single-dose DEX 4 mg&#xD;
      intramuscular use, and 3-no premedication. Secondary outcomes will include correlation of&#xD;
      mentioned salivary mediators with postoperative clinical parameters such as pain, swelling&#xD;
      and trismus. Furthermore, rescue medication intake, patient satisfaction with the treatment,&#xD;
      and incidence of potential adverse events will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, double-blinded clinical trial will be&#xD;
      conducted at the Department of Oral surgery and Laboratory for basic science, School of&#xD;
      Dental medicine, University of Belgrade, Serbia. The research will be performed following the&#xD;
      CONSORT guidelines, per the Helsinki Declaration. Subjects who require unilateral fully&#xD;
      impacted mandibular third molar extraction will be screened for eligibility. After meeting&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria, participants will receive verbal and written information on the study&#xD;
      objectives, protocol as well as the possible risks and benefits of the study. Only the&#xD;
      eligible subjects who agree with the information provided and sign an informed consent form&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study. A total of 90 patients will be included (n=30).&#xD;
      Computer-generated blocked randomization with a 1:1:1 allocation ratio (block size 6) will be&#xD;
      performed by a researcher not included in the study (Microsoft Excel, version 2016). To&#xD;
      conceal the allocation, the papers containing a code of the allocated group (1-ETOX group;&#xD;
      2-DEX group; 3-control group) will be sequentially packed in opaque envelopes and sealed. One&#xD;
      hour before the intervention, the same independent researcher will unseal the following&#xD;
      envelope and, depending on the study group, administer ETOX in a blurred plastic container&#xD;
      (ETOX group), DEX in the unspecified syringe (DEX group), or provide written information on&#xD;
      cold packs usage during the postoperative period (control group). The patients will be&#xD;
      unaware of the generic and the brand name of the medications, but they will be notified that&#xD;
      the drugs are registered and on the market. The allocation will be concealed until the&#xD;
      finishing of the data analysis. The surgeon who will perform all the interventions and the&#xD;
      researcher who will collect the data will be masked to the patients' allocations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After recruitment, data on age (years), sex, and smoking status (no smoking, ≤10/day, or&#xD;
      &gt;10/day) will be obtained from all the included patients. During the same visit, the surgical&#xD;
      intervention will be scheduled, and the third molar position will be estimated on panoramic&#xD;
      radiographs, according to the Pell and Gregory and Winter classifications. Initial exam,&#xD;
      pre-, perioperative, and follow-up measurements will be performed by one blinded clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the second study visit, one hour before surgical intervention, patients will be instructed&#xD;
      to note the amount of pain experienced at that moment on a 10-cm long visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS), where 0 means no pain at all and 10 represent the greatest pain they ever felt. A&#xD;
      6-point verbal rating pain scale (VRS) will be also provided to the patients to document the&#xD;
      current pain (1-no pain; 2-mild pain; 3-moderate pain; 4-severe pain; 5-very severe pain;&#xD;
      6-the worst possible pain). Additionally, baseline measurements of a maximal inter-incisor&#xD;
      and lobule-pogonion distance at the side of the extraction-required third molar in&#xD;
      millimeters will be obtained by a soft tape measure. Afterward, 1 hour before the surgery&#xD;
      patients will receive: single-dose ETOX 90 mg (Etoxib®, KRKA, Novo Mesto, Slovenia) orally&#xD;
      (ETOX group); single-dose DEX 4 mg (Dexason®, Galenika, Belgrade, Serbia) in deltoid muscle&#xD;
      (DEX group); no premedication (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After regional inferior alveolar, lingual, and buccal nerve blocks with a local anesthetic&#xD;
      consisting of 4% articaine hydrochloride with 1:100000 epinephrine (Septanest®, Septodont,&#xD;
      Saint-Maur-des-Fosses, France), the surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molar will&#xD;
      be performed according to the technique previously described in the literature: after&#xD;
      full-thickness flap elevation, bone removal will be performed by rotatory instruments under&#xD;
      sterile saline irrigation. Instruments such as levers will be used for tooth extraction, and&#xD;
      tooth separation will be performed, if necessary. After tooth extraction and bone edges&#xD;
      smoothening, the wound will be primary sutured. All the surgical procedures will be performed&#xD;
      by one experienced oral surgeon, masked to the allocation group. Perioperatively, the&#xD;
      duration of the intervention (min), the amount of local anesthetic solution used (ml), tooth&#xD;
      separation if performed, and any complications such as inferior alveolar vascular damage will&#xD;
      be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the intervention, patients will be advised to take rescue medication if pain occurs&#xD;
      at any time. Paracetamol 500 mg regimen will be prescribed as an escape analgesic&#xD;
      (Paracetamol®, Galenika, Belgrade, Serbia), with the instructions to not exceed the maximal&#xD;
      recommended daily dose (4000 mg). Additionally, the antibiotics will be prescribed:&#xD;
      amoxicillin 500 mg or clindamycin 600 mg in case of penicillin hypersensitivity, three times&#xD;
      a day for 5 days. Thereafter, all the patients will receive written hygienic-dietary&#xD;
      instructions with the advice of careful oral hygiene maintenance, a soft diet, avoidance of&#xD;
      mouth rinsing, as well as smoking, hot food, and hot beverages. The additional penned&#xD;
      information for the control group will involve repeated use of cold packs with a 20-min&#xD;
      pause, and will be submitted to the patients preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, patients will received a pre-designed take-home diary containing fields for&#xD;
      rescue analgesic registration (every time of intake, number of the regimen, and dose) and a&#xD;
      list of the most common adverse events (headache, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, insomnia,&#xD;
      fever), with instructions to check any of the listed, or write down any other if occurred.&#xD;
      Additionally, patients will be instructed to record pain intensity on VAS and VRS at 2h, 4h,&#xD;
      6h, 8h, 10h, 12h, and 72h following the surgery, as well as in every case of rescue&#xD;
      medication intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control check-ups will be scheduled at 24h, 48h, and 7 days postoperatively. On each control&#xD;
      examination, the 5-point Likert scale will be used to assess patient satisfaction at the&#xD;
      respective time. The following question will be asked: &quot;How satisfied are you at this moment&#xD;
      with the impacted mandibular third molar surgery?&quot;, and the possible answers will be: &quot;5-very&#xD;
      satisfied&quot;, &quot;4-satisfied&quot;, &quot;3-neutral&quot;, &quot;2-dissatisfied&quot;, and &quot;1-very dissatisfied&quot;. After&#xD;
      collecting the answers from every check-up visit, average patient satisfaction with the&#xD;
      treatment will be calculated. During every control study visit, the severity of pain&#xD;
      experiencing at that moment will be noted on VAS and VRS. Maximal inter-incisor and&#xD;
      lobule-pogonion distance on the operated side will be measured. In addition, at a 7-day&#xD;
      check-up the take-home diary will obtained from the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples containing 0,5 ml of unstimulated saliva will be collected from the floor of the&#xD;
      mouth by means of 2 ml plastic syringe and dull needle of 18 Gauge thickness in four time&#xD;
      points: One hour before surgery, immediately, 48h and 7 days after the surgery. Saliva&#xD;
      samples will be collected in sterile plastic tubes that are pre-filled with fluid that&#xD;
      prevents RNA degradation and stored at -80 degrees Celsius until laboratory analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory procedures will be performed with aim to assess the level of relative gene as well&#xD;
      as protein expression of inflammatory (COX-2, PGE2) and early wound healing (RUNX2, ALP, OCN,&#xD;
      MAR1) mediators in tested groups in different time points of interest. After RNA isolation&#xD;
      and obtaining of complementary DNA (according to the manufacturer instructions), relative&#xD;
      gene expression of COX-2, PGE2, RUNX2, ALP and OCN will be evaluated by means of real-time&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction assay. Protein expression of PGE2 and MAR1 will be performed by&#xD;
      enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed in statistical package SPSS, version 22.0 (SPSS, Inc.&#xD;
      Chicago). Data will be presented through mean, standard deviation, median, maximum and&#xD;
      minimum values, percent. Depending of the data distribution, appropriate parametric or&#xD;
      non-parametric tests will be performed. Regression models will be performed to determine the&#xD;
      predictors of detected inter-group differences. The level of significance will be set at&#xD;
      0.05.&#xD;
