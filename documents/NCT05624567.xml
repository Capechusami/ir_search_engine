  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients undergoing surgery due to suspected endometriosis in a previously selected&#xD;
      3-month period within the study period (between 12/2022 and 12/24) (each participating center&#xD;
      will define the particular 3 months in question) will be asked to participate in this study.&#xD;
      Upon inclusion, patients will be asked to fill out questionnaires regarding&#xD;
      endometriosis-associated symptoms as well as a detailed patient history. Furthermore,&#xD;
      patients will be asked to fill out 2 standardized questionnaires, one regarding quality of&#xD;
      life (Endometriosis-Health Profile-30) and one regarding sexual function (Female Sexual&#xD;
      Function Index). Six and 12 months after surgery, patients will again be asked to fill out&#xD;
      these two standardized questionnaires as well as a questionnaire regarding postsurgical&#xD;
      therapy and endometriosis-associated symptoms. The surgeon will be asked to fill out a form&#xD;
      regarding the surgical procedure and possible surgical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints of this multicenter observational study are to prospectively examine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. if the individual symptoms correlate with the individual compartments of the surgical&#xD;
           #ENZIAN Endometriosis classification&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. if the surgical intervention has an effect on the quality of life in relation to the&#xD;
           individual #ENZIAN compartments.&#xD;
