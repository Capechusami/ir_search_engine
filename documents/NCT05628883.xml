    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed, unresectable or metastatic melanoma&#xD;
             as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Cutaneous acral melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mucosal melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ocular melanoma (including uveal, iris, conjunctival melanoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have failed, be refractory to, or unable to tolerate standard of&#xD;
             care in the opinion of the Investigator. For participants with cutaneous non-acral&#xD;
             melanoma, standard of care therapy includes a PD-1/L1 inhibitor, a CTLA-4 inhibitor,&#xD;
             and if BRAF V600 activating mutation positive, a BRAF ± MEK inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: if treatment failure occurs during adjuvant therapy or within 6 months of adjuvant&#xD;
        therapy completion, this will count as a failure of the applicable regimen as noted above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any systemic therapy, including anti-cancer monoclonal antibodies, must have been&#xD;
             completed at least 4 weeks from the start of lymphodepleting therapy (except for&#xD;
             bridging therapy as defined below), and any prior therapy-related AEs must have&#xD;
             resolved to Grade ≤ 1 except for alopecia and vitiligo. Neuropathy must have resolved&#xD;
             to Grade ≤ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be between the ages of 18 and 75 years old. Additionally,&#xD;
             participants who are ≥ 60 years of age must undergo a cardiology evaluation including&#xD;
             a cardiac stress test after which they must be deemed to be low/acceptable risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 times the institutional ULN; ≤ 5 times ULN if patient&#xD;
                  has liver metastasis&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               6. Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL (except in patients with Gilbert's Syndrome where the&#xD;
                  bilirubin must be ≤ 3 mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seronegative for Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody, hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antigen, and hepatitis C (HCV) antibody (if HCV antibody positive, must be tested for&#xD;
             HCV RNA, which must be negative to be eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with brain metastases are eligible provided that the brain metastases&#xD;
             have been successfully treated with stereotactic radiosurgery or resection and&#xD;
             clinically stable for at least 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have not undergone prior TIL harvest (i.e., the patient was not&#xD;
             enrolled in the Banked TIL protocol MCC# &lt;TBD&gt;) must have at least 1 cm of tumor&#xD;
             amenable for resection for TIL generation, in addition to, having at least one target&#xD;
             lesion that can be used for response assessment by RECIST 1.1 criteria after TIL&#xD;
             harvest.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have undergone prior TIL harvest with the banking protocol (MCC#&#xD;
             &lt;TBD&gt;) must have adequate numbers of cryopreserved TIL after the pre-REP to meet&#xD;
             criteria for proceeding with TBio-4101 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be willing and able to undergo an apheresis procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of TBio-4101 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because TIL agents, as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial&#xD;
             including IL-2 are known to be teratogenic, both males and females of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential must be willing to practice birth control starting with screening through 1&#xD;
             year after the last study drug is administered for females or 6 months for males.&#xD;
             Note: Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraception requirement:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To prevent pregnancy, patients who are able to conceive or father children must use a&#xD;
             highly effective contraception method during sexual activity starting with Screening&#xD;
             through 1 year after the last study drug is administered for females or 6 months for&#xD;
             males.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Based on their mechanisms of action, the NMA-LD chemotherapy, aldesleukin (IL-2), can cause&#xD;
        fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Effects of TBio-4101 on fetal development&#xD;
        are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Definition of Non-Reproductive Potential: For this trial, male patients will be&#xD;
             considered to be of non-reproductive potential if they have azoospermia (whether due&#xD;
             to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical condition). Female patients&#xD;
             will be considered of non-reproductive potential if they are either: (a)&#xD;
             postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an alternative&#xD;
             medical cause; in women &lt; 45 years of age, a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&#xD;
             level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in&#xD;
             women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. In the absence&#xD;
             of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single follicle FSHH measurement is insufficient); (b)&#xD;
             Or have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or&#xD;
             bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion, at least 6 weeks prior to screening; (c) Or has a&#xD;
             congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Definition of Highly Effective Contraception: The following are examples of acceptable&#xD;
             contraception methods to prevent pregnancy. This list may not be comprehensive for all&#xD;
             regions, so the Investigator must discuss sexual activity and contraception usage with&#xD;
             the patient. Hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pill (estrogen/progestin pill&#xD;
             or progestin-only pill), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or&#xD;
             subcutaneous contraceptive injection, Intrauterine device (IUD), Intrauterine hormone&#xD;
             releasing system (IUS), Bilateral tubal occlusion, Vasectomized partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner are&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants, regardless of age, who have a current or past medical history of&#xD;
             ischemic heart disease, or clinically significant atrial or ventricular rhythm&#xD;
             abnormality are excluded unless they undergo a cardiac stress test and cardiology&#xD;
             clearance examination and are determined to be low or acceptable risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Participants with any clinically significant cardiac wall movement abnormality are&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received prior cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with either a primary immunodeficiency disorder (i.e., severe combined&#xD;
             immunodeficiency syndrome) or acquired immunodeficiency disorders (such as HIV/AIDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the agents used in this study have&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             TBio-4101 or the other agents in the study, breastfeeding should be discontinued if&#xD;
             the mother is enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants taking systemic steroid therapy (other than replacement therapy) or&#xD;
             therapy with any immunosuppressive medications such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).&#xD;

             predicted value&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have a medical condition that&#xD;
             would subject the patient to prohibitive risk by participation in this study, or who&#xD;
             may be unable to safely complete the apheresis, tumor harvest, lymphodepletion&#xD;
             regimen, TIL infusion, or aldesleukin/ IL-2 administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with active infections requiring parenteral antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with autoimmune disease currently or within the past 6 months requiring&#xD;
             systemic treatment with immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg of&#xD;
             prednisone-equivalent daily dosing), immunosuppressive biologic agents, or disease&#xD;
             modifying antirheumatic drug agents (DMARDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Participants with autoimmune thyroiditis on replacement thyroid medication are&#xD;
        eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants requiring chronic anti-coagulant therapy that cannot either be&#xD;
             discontinued or changed to an anti-coagulant such as a low molecular weight heparin,&#xD;
             which has a relatively short half-life, if clinically indicated during the period of&#xD;
             thrombocytopenia resulting from the lymphodepletion regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has evidence of impeding perforation, obstruction or bleeding (requiring transfusion)&#xD;
             due to the tumor.&#xD;
