    <textblock>
      This is a multi-national trial. The trial aims to study the long-term safety of LUM-201 in&#xD;
      subjects with Idiopathic Pediatric Growth Hormone Deficiency (iPGHD). This study will also&#xD;
      assess pharmacodynamics and efficacy response to therapy with LUM-201.&#xD;

      An Extension Study to Monitor Long-Term Safety of LUM-201 Treatment in Children with&#xD;
      Idiopathic Growth Hormone Deficiency. This study will last for up to 36 months to allow&#xD;
      collection of additional long-term safety and efficacy data related to LUM-201 treatment in&#xD;
      the pediatric patient population. Subjects will enter into this trial after successful&#xD;
      participation in a prior LUM-201 study. This study will consist of visits every 6 months&#xD;
      through three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a total of 7 in-person visits and 7 telephone visits every 6 months. At the clinic&#xD;
      visits, subjects will have a physical exam and blood collection as well as efficacy&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Parent/caregiver must sign the informed consent, and the subject must sign the assent,&#xD;
             as applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have successfully participated in a pediatric LUM-201 GHD study through at least&#xD;
             the 12-month visit, and be eligible for continuation of treatment, pending all other&#xD;
             enrollment criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical or genetic condition that, in the opinion of the PI and/or MMs, adds&#xD;
             unwarranted risk to the use of LUM-201&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has planned or is receiving current long-term treatment with medications known to act&#xD;
             as substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of the cytochrome system CYP3A4 that&#xD;
             metabolizes LUM-201. Subjects receiving shorter-term (two weeks or less) treatment&#xD;
             with these medications should be evaluated on case-by-case basis by the PI in&#xD;
             consultation with the MMs.&#xD;
