      This is a non-significant risk, single site, prospective study to be conducted in the&#xD;
      department of pediatric dentistry of the Hadassah Medical Center, Faculty of Dental Medicine,&#xD;
      Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel. Subject participation will require one visit during&#xD;
      which consent, screening, enrollment, and imaging will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and diagnostic methods to be used during this study are those that are routinely&#xD;
      used in the diagnosis of caries in this site, which include bitewing radiographs (BWR). This&#xD;
      standard of care is provided for all site's patients, including the patients who don't&#xD;
      participate in this clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard set of BWR for subjects ages 4-9 years will be taken to include the complete&#xD;
      dentition of the subjects. No additional x-ray should be taken for the sole purpose of this&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the routine clinical diagnostics, the subjects will be scanned using the 5D&#xD;
      system. The investigator will capture a full arch scan of the maxillary arch and mandibular&#xD;
      arch of each subject with the iTero Element 5D system. For each subject, the Investigator&#xD;
      will grade carious lesions in the BWR and Element intra-oral scan according to ADA staging&#xD;
      guidelines. The results will be documented using Caries Evaluation Forms. The Investigator&#xD;
      will assess and document the findings of each diagnostic test separately before reviewing the&#xD;
      next test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases where caries debridement is indicated, carious lesion depth will be documented&#xD;
      during and compared to NIRI and BWR images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treatment decisions will be made according to the standard of care in the clinic and no&#xD;
      treatment will be conducted for the sole purpose of the study&#xD;

    <measure>Non-inferiority of the iTero 5D compared to BWR in dental caries detection</measure>
    <time_frame>Grading the carious lesions for the first 20 subjects will be conducted up to 2 month from completion the first 20 subjects visits. The rest 50 subjects will be evaluated up to 1 month from completion the last subject visit.</time_frame>
    <description>For each subject, the Investigator will grade carious lesions in the BWR and Element intra-oral scan (NIRI) according to ADA staging guidelines. The results will be documented using Caries Evaluation Forms for BWR and for Element intra-oral scan . The Investigator will assess and document the findings of each diagnostic test separately before reviewing the next test.&#xD;
The iTero 5D performance will be non-inferior to BWR performance in detecting the existence of primary interproximal caries lesions above the gingiva in pediatric population.&#xD;
The study will include an interim analysis to assess the iTero Element 5D system usability among the first 20 pediatric subjects.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare users' experience using a qualitative questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>The questionnaire will be filled immediately after the intra-oral scan for each subject. Final report of the comparison will be generated up to 15 weeks from last subject visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Qualitative users' feedback will be collected through questionnaire relating to: chair time, the ability to capture tooth surfaces (reachability), patient's experience (gag reflex, discomfort),what Frankl rating would reflect the patient's behavior during the procedure,what is the patient legal guardian's compliance to approve the procedure, if and how the 3D model of the scan assists as a patient communication tool</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>To compare carious lesions depth as appears in NIRI and BWR images to clinical depth observed during caries excavation</measure>
    <time_frame>During the study period and up to 6 months from last subject visit</time_frame>
    <description>Lesion depth will be documented in cases where caries debridement was conducted. NIRI and BWR images will be compared to the clinical findings</description>

    <description>BWR-The most common type of dental x-ray taken during a routine dental checkup is called a &quot;bitewing radiograph.&quot; This type of X-ray shows the upper and lower back teeth in a single view and is taken to see how the upper and lower teeth line up, to check for decay, and discover bone loss due to infection and serious gum disease.</description>

    <description>The iTero Element 5D is an intra-oral scanner that incorporates near-infrared illumination capabilities used to provide a near-infrared image of the teeth enabling the detection of both occlusal and proximal caries, at the various stages, ranging from initial enamel caries to established caries reaching the DEJ.&#xD;
Near-infrared Imaging (NIRI) is a nonionizing imaging technology that leverages differences in scattering and absorption of near-infrared light depending on the degree of tooth mineralization.</description>
