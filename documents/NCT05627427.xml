  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine neoplams (NENs) are uncommon, but with a significant increasing incidence and&#xD;
      prevalence with advances in diagnostic techniques. NENs can originate from various parts of&#xD;
      the body and are highly heterogeneous. Neuroendocrine tumors (NET), dividing into G1, G2, G3,&#xD;
      are well-differentiated types with slow growth and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) are&#xD;
      poorly-differentiated with high malignancy. Pancreatic carcinoma is one of the malignant&#xD;
      neoplasms with a very high mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For NET G3, NEC and pancreatic, there are limited treatment options especially for those who&#xD;
      progressed on standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surufatinib is a novel multi-targeted kinase inhibitor on VEGFR-1, 2, 3, FGFR1, and CSF1R,&#xD;
      which has required the China NMPA approval on unresectable NETs (G1&amp;G2). The pivital phase&#xD;
      III clinical trial on NEC is ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sintilimab is a PD-1 inhibitor with the approval on gastric cancer, non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evidence has shown the anti-tumor activity of surufatinib in combination with PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitor in solid tumors, including NEN, small-cell lung cancer, G/GEJ cancer, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of surufatinib in combination&#xD;
      with sintilimab in the treatment of NET G3, NEC and pancreatic carcinoma, in order to provide&#xD;
      more treatment options for the patients who failed standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
