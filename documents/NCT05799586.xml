    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effects of Traditional Chinese&#xD;
      Medicine (TCM) health preservation for depression on depressive symptoms reduction and other&#xD;
      health-related outcomes among Hong Kong Chinese adults with depression. Participants in&#xD;
      intervention group will receive TCM health preservation course for six weeks (6 sessions, 2&#xD;
      hours each) and practice TCM health preservation during the 6-week follow-up period.&#xD;
      Participants in the control group (waitlist control) will receive usual care. After the&#xD;
      follow-up assessment, TCM health preservation courses for depression will be provided to them&#xD;
      for compensation.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Two-arm parallel assignment involves two groups of participants. In this study, one group will receive Traditional Chinese Medicine health preservation for depression, and the other group will receive the waitlist control. Thus, during the trial, participants in one group receive Traditional Chinese Medicine health preservation &quot;in parallel&quot; to participants in the waitlist control group.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: Baseline, week 2, week 4, week 6, week 8, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9, a self-rated questionnaire to assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms of an individual during the last 2 weeks on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), with a total score ranging from 0 to 27. A higher score indicates a higher severity of depression symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: Baseline, week 2, week 4, week 6, week 8, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a four-point Likert scale for identifying probable cases of GAD and assess the severity of symptoms of GAD for the past 2 weeks. The total score of GAD-7 varies from 0 to 21, and responses include &quot;nearly every day,&quot; &quot;more than half the days,&quot; &quot;several days&quot;, and &quot;not at all&quot;. The cutoff point of 5, 10, and 15 of GAD-7 might be interpreted as showing mild, moderate, and severe levels of anxiety. Higher scores indicate more severe GAD symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: Baseline, week 2, week 4, week 6, week 8, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS-10 is a 10-item scale that is often used for measuring perceived psychological stress. Each item is rated on a 5-point Liket scale during the past month, referring to &quot;4&quot; as &quot;very often&quot; and &quot;0&quot; as never. The total score changes from 0 to 40, with a higher score meaning a higher perceived psychological stress level.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: Baseline, week 2, week 4, week 6, week 8, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is a seven-item self-rating scale to assess the severity of insomnia, distress, and functional impairment associated with insomnia on a 5-point Likert scale. The score of each item of ISI ranges from 0 (no problem) to 4 (very severe problem), and the total score is interpreted as below: absence of insomnia as 0 to 7, sub-threshold insomnia as 8 to14, moderate insomnia as 15 to 21, and severe insomnia as 22 to 28.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: Baseline, week 2, week 4, week 6, week 8, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The FAS is a 10-item scale that evaluates symptoms of chronic fatigue with a five-point Likert-type scale, which ranges from 1 (&quot;never&quot;) to 5 (&quot;always&quot;). A higher score means greater fatigue severity. The total score ranges from 10 to 50. A total FAS score &lt; 22 means no fatigue, a scoreâ‰¥ 22 refers to fatigue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Short-Form (six-dimension) Health Survey (SF-6D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: Baseline, week 6, week 8, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-6D covers six domains using a scale of 1 to 6 to evaluate participants' general health and quality of life. Higher scores indicate better health status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: Baseline, week 2, week 4, week 6, week 8, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The GSE scale is a four-point Likert scale with ten items appropriate for evaluating an individual's self-efficacy. It is scored ranging from 1 point to 4 points, referring to &quot;not at all true&quot; to &quot;exactly true&quot; and the total score varied from 10 to 40. A higher score shows a more satisfactory self-efficacy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II (HPLP II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: Baseline, week 4, week 6, week 8, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The HPLP II is a scale with 52 items and 6 domains for measuring health-promoting behavior, defined as a multidimensional pattern of self-initiated perceptions and actions that serve to maintain or increase the level of self-actualization, wellness, and fulfillment of a person. The total scores of HPLP-II varies from 52 to 208. Higher HPLP II score denotes better level of health-promoting lifestyle.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Credibility/ Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: Baseline, week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The CEQ is a self-reported scale with 6 items and two subscales of treatment credibility and outcome expectancy to measure the participants' treatment credibility and outcome expectancy for improvement. The final scoring of the CEQ is computed by the sum of the items composing each subscale, with a higher quotation referring to higher treatment credibility and outcome expectation.&#xD;
The CEQ taps on participants' affective and cognitive evaluations of treatment satisfaction, credibility, and expectation. The subscale of credibility assesses beliefs about the treatment strength. The expectancy subscale assesses how participants perceive their symptoms will improve during the intervention period.</description>

    <description>The participants in the traditional Chinese medicine health preservation group will attend six traditional Chinese medicine health preservation courses (2h each per one, for 6 weeks) to learn and experience traditional Chinese medicine health preservation from a registered traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in a classroom at the School Nursing, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.&#xD;
Each class will be conducted in a small group of 4 to 6 participants to enhance interaction and ensure the quality of teaching. Participants will then practice traditional Chinese medicine health preservation at home for 6 weeks.</description>
