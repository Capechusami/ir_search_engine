    <textblock>
      To address the significant barriers to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) implementation for&#xD;
      cisgender women and address racial inequities in HIV prevention in the United States (US), a&#xD;
      novel approach that accounts for multilevel influences is necessary. This study is the second&#xD;
      part (Aim 2) of a multi-component project and involves a patient- and clinic-level&#xD;
      intervention in a public health family planning clinic in Duval County Florida, where most&#xD;
      patients are women of color. The area has one of the highest HIV incidence rates among women&#xD;
      in the US. The investigators developed 1) a tablet-based decision support tool (DST) that&#xD;
      helps users learn about HIV vulnerabilities and HIV prevention strategies to inform how they&#xD;
      consider options for reducing their likelihood of acquiring HIV, and 2) clinic-wide trainings&#xD;
      regarding shared decision making and trauma informed care. In Aim 1 (previously completed),&#xD;
      participants were randomized to viewing an HIV prevention DST in a clinic that had not&#xD;
      received clinic-wide trainings. In Aim 2 (the present study), there will be two phases. In&#xD;
      the first phase, participants will receive care at the clinic following training; the DST&#xD;
      will not be used. In the second phase, in addition to being seen at a clinic-site that has&#xD;
      experienced the training, participants will use the DST before their visit. Participants will&#xD;
      be surveyed about experiences with HIV prevention counseling, intentions about using HIV&#xD;
      prevention, and DST use (among those in the active arm in the second phase). A subset of&#xD;
      participants, individuals who self-identify as Black or Latinx, will also complete a&#xD;
      post-clinic visit interview. The investigators will assess whether participants initiated an&#xD;
      HIV prevention method three months following their initial visit. The main outcomes will&#xD;
      include a quantitative and qualitative assessment of PrEP or other HIV prevention use,&#xD;
      decisional certainty, and satisfaction with information about HIV prevention options.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although 13% of the U.S. female population is Black, 60% of new HIV diagnoses in U.S. women&#xD;
      occur among Black women. The South is the epicenter of the U.S. HIV epidemic, including in&#xD;
      women, and Black Southern women are disproportionately affected: Black women account for 69%&#xD;
      of new HIV diagnoses in women in the South. As the first highly effective, discrete,&#xD;
      woman-controlled HIV prevention method, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir&#xD;
      disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine radically expands HIV prevention options for women.&#xD;
      However, uptake of PrEP in U.S. women has lagged, particularly among groups most affected by&#xD;
      HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PrEP cascades outline the necessary steps for accessing PrEP, including screening and&#xD;
      identifying eligible individuals, linkage to care, prescription, and initiation of PrEP. Data&#xD;
      suggest there are multilevel barriers related to the process of screening for HIV risk in&#xD;
      women and identifying potential PrEP candidates that may drive a significant drop off early&#xD;
      in the PrEP cascade for women. Women report feeling judged by risk assessment questions and&#xD;
      experience stigma around disclosing sexual practices. As a result, if screening is required&#xD;
      to educate patients about PrEP - as is true in most clinical settings - many women for whom&#xD;
      PrEP is appropriate may never learn about PrEP. Further, women have low levels of knowledge&#xD;
      about HIV risk and HIV prevention options, and therefore will not seek out PrEP services&#xD;
      themselves. Lastly, there is often limited time to educate patients in busy clinics. By&#xD;
      offering education to all women about vulnerabilities to HIV as well as information about HIV&#xD;
      prevention methods including PrEP, at-risk women can circumvent these multifactorial barriers&#xD;
      and request PrEP. Electronic decision support tools (DST), which have been used with success&#xD;
      in a range of healthcare contexts including contraception, provide an efficient and private&#xD;
      mechanism for this information-sharing step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team developed a tablet-based tool that is designed to provide universal PrEP&#xD;
      education and facilitate women's agency to identify their own risks and interest in PrEP. It&#xD;
      was refined with iterative feedback from patient and community stakeholders and finalized&#xD;
      based on cognitive testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DST provides information about vulnerabilities to HIV, and emphasizes the variable and&#xD;
      individual nature of baseline risk. It provides information on the core characteristics of&#xD;
      different HIV prevention methods, and then the opportunity to explore these characteristics&#xD;
      in depth, including efficacy, safety and side effects. The user chooses the level of&#xD;
      information that they wish to receive through the interactive interface, allowing for an&#xD;
      individualized experience. Upon reaching the end of the tool, information on the tablet&#xD;
      suggests that women ask their provider about HIV prevention methods they are interested in&#xD;
      using, based on their preferences for method characteristics, and their questions to&#xD;
      facilitate deliberation with the provider. The DST takes approximately 10 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. A decision support tool was chosen as a key component of the study following its&#xD;
      proven effectiveness in offering contraceptive options to patients. The HIV prevention DST&#xD;
      was tested in Aim 1 of this study: participants were randomized to viewing the DST or not,&#xD;
      prior to receiving usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the study team recognizes the importance of receiving health information from a&#xD;
      trusted source, such as health care providers or health educators, when making important&#xD;
      health decisions. Therefore, this study (Aim 2) will offer and assess the effects of a&#xD;
      combined intervention of the DST following a clinic-wide training on shared decision making&#xD;
      and trauma-informed care. Shared decision making is an effective strategy to offer&#xD;
      information and services to patients as it allows the health care provider to share their&#xD;
      clinical knowledge and expertise while partnering with the patient to elicit their&#xD;
      experiential knowledge, needs and preferences. Through partnership between a patient and&#xD;
      provider, the patient can make an informed decision about HIV prevention and other health&#xD;
      needs that align with their values and desires and can result in greater adherence to the&#xD;
      prevention or treatment options and satisfaction with care. The training will also include&#xD;
      information about trauma-informed approaches to deliver health care in a person-centered and&#xD;
      affirming manner. This training will highlight how many people, particularly those vulnerable&#xD;
      to HIV due to intersecting oppressions, carry traumas that impact their exposure to health&#xD;
      issues and the resources needed to mitigate these harms. It is critical that health care&#xD;
      providers and health professionals are aware of intersecting forms of oppression that create&#xD;
      trauma, including those that the medical profession create and perpetuate. A combined&#xD;
      approach of shared decision making at the interpersonal level and trauma informed care at the&#xD;
      clinic-level is an equity-oriented strategy to offering HIV prevention information to women&#xD;
      in the Southeastern U.S. who are disproportionately impacted by HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 366 individuals who self-identify as women presenting to one reproductive&#xD;
      health clinic in Duval County, Florida, will be recruited to the study in Aim 2, with 183&#xD;
      enrolled in each of the two phases. As the decision support tool is primarily focused on&#xD;
      cisgender women, participants who do not identify as cisgender will be included in the study,&#xD;
      but their study data will be analyzed separately. In the first phase of Aim 2 of the study,&#xD;
      participants will receive care as usual at a clinic site after the trainings have been held&#xD;
      for staff. In the second phase of Aim 2, participants will receive care at this same clinic&#xD;
      that has been exposed to the training and will also view the HIV prevention DST. These&#xD;
      participants will be compared to those recruited in Aim 1 of this study, in which&#xD;
      participants accessed care from the same clinic prior to clinic-wide trainings, and half of&#xD;
      participants viewed the HIV prevention DST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to these interventions, a subset of 40 participants (20 per phase) will be asked&#xD;
      to allow audio-recording of their counseling sessions with a provider. A subset of up to 40&#xD;
      additional participants (20 per phase), all of whom self-identify as women of color, will be&#xD;
      invited to complete one-hour, semi-structured interviews after their clinic visit about their&#xD;
      experiences of using the DST, HIV prevention counseling, and decision making about PrEP.&#xD;
      Those who participated in Aim 1, are not excluded from participating in Aim 2 however, they&#xD;
      will not be eligible to participate in an interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Women who receive care at a clinic following clinic-wide trainings on shared decision&#xD;
           making and trauma informed care are more likely to initiate PrEP as compared to women&#xD;
           who received care at the same clinic prior to training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In a clinic that received clinic-wide trainings in shared decision making and trauma&#xD;
           informed care, women who use the HIV prevention decision support tool are more likely to&#xD;
           initiate PrEP as compared to women who did not use the tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Women who receive care at a clinic following clinic-wide training on shared decision&#xD;
           making and trauma informed care and who also used the decision support tool are more&#xD;
           likely to initiate PrEP as compared to women who receive care at the same clinic prior&#xD;
           to training and did not use the tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Women who receive care at a clinic following clinic-wide trainings on shared decision&#xD;
           making and trauma informed care and who also used the decision support tool are more&#xD;
           likely to initiate PrEP as compared to those who receive care at the same clinic prior&#xD;
           to training and used the DST.&#xD;

    <description>The clinic-wide trainings combine principles of shared decision-making and trauma informed care to inform providers and clinic staff of an equitable approach to offering HIV prevention information. These care delivery approaches have been used in health education and counseling in a range of contexts and are effective strategies for care provision. Participants in this arm will receive care from providers and staff who received training.</description>

The DST is founded on principles of decision-science and will address barriers to PrEP delivery. The DST will present HIV prevention information through a tablet in the clinical setting. The tool provides information about vulnerabilities to HIV and core characteristics of different HIV prevention methods, and the opportunity to explore these characteristics in depth, including efficacy, safety and side effects. The tool emphasizes the highly variable and individual nature of baseline risk.</description>
