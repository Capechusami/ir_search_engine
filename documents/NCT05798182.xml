  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to measure whether the flow rate through the brachial artery and&#xD;
      inflammatory markers were associated with the development of tissue edema in the surgical&#xD;
      intensive care unit patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study was performed using a ultrasound machine with linear probe settings at 50 mm depth&#xD;
      and 40 decibel [dB] gain that did not change during the study. The probe was placed on&#xD;
      vascular ultrasound measurement. The diameter of the brachial artery in the middle of the&#xD;
      upper arm and the flow rate through the artery was measured on postoperative days 1 and 2.&#xD;
      The presence of the edema was measured above the 3rd metacarpal bone as the distance from the&#xD;
      skin surface to the periosteum. An average of three assessments was shown. Patient's age,&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI), type of admission, white blood cells (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP),&#xD;
      and procalcitonin (PCT) were also registered.&#xD;
