  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a syndrome compromising many phenotypes including N-ERD (caused by increased&#xD;
      4-series leukotriene (LT) production). n-3 PUFA supplementation modulates 4-series LT and has&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects. However, other than in a pilot study with dietary manipulation,&#xD;
      the effects of N-ERD are unknown. The primary objective is to determine whether n-3 PUFA&#xD;
      supplementation in people with N-ERD can improve asthma control using the asthma control&#xD;
      questionnaire (ACQ-7). This is a placebo controlled randomised controlled parallel&#xD;
      multicentre study with of 6g per day of PUFA for 6 months in people with N-ERD and poor&#xD;
      asthma control&#xD;

      Asthma is a syndrome compromising many phenotypes including N-ERD (caused by increased&#xD;
      4-series leukotriene (LT) production). n-3 PUFA supplementation modulates 4-series LT and has&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects. However, other than in a pilot study with dietary manipulation,&#xD;
      the effects of NERD are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine whether n-3 PUFA supplementation in people with N-ERD&#xD;
      can improve asthma control using the asthma control questionnaire (ACQ-7). Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to determine whether n-3 PUFA improves asthma and rhinitis symptoms and&#xD;
      quality of life and airway calibre. Mechanistic objectives are to assess effects on red blood&#xD;
      cell fatty acid composition, cyclooxygenase pathways and airway inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a placebo controlled randomised controlled parallel multicentre study with of 6g per&#xD;
      day of PUFA for 6 months in people with N-ERD and poor asthma control. Ninety-eight people&#xD;
      will be included in the study if they have a reliable history of N-ERD or a positive nasal&#xD;
      aspirin challenge, an ACQ-7 &gt; 1.5 and are on stable treatment. People with other significant&#xD;
      disease, recent respiratory tract infection, receiving aspirin desensitisation, biological&#xD;
      asthma therapies will be excluded, as will those with a significant smoking history or&#xD;
      alcohol consumption. The intervention will be 6g of n-3 PUFA (EPA and DHA as six (5.04g&#xD;
      EPA+DHA) taken once daily, or in divided doses, with food for 6 months. The control will be&#xD;
      matched placebo. Measurements will be at be made at baseline, 3 months and 6 months for ACQ-7&#xD;
      (equivalent to ACQ-6 plus spirometry), exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and blood for red blood&#xD;
      cell fatty acid concentration, blood eosinophil count and safety markers. The following&#xD;
      questionnaires will also be undertaken at these time-points: Mini Asthma Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire (mini-AQLQ), and Euroqol 5 dimension 5 level (EQ5D-5L). The ACQ-6 will be&#xD;
      measured every 6 weeks throughout the study and the food frequency questionnaire will be&#xD;
      measured at baseline and 6 months. Urine will be analysed for uLTE4 and prostaglandin D2 at&#xD;
      baseline and 6 months. Induced sputum will be obtained at baseline and 6 months in a subgroup&#xD;
      for differential cell count and specialised pro-resolving mediators.&#xD;
