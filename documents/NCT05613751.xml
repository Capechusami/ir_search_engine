  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women and children with chronic medical conditions are at increased risk of&#xD;
      hospitalisation, intensive care admission and death from influenza and COVID-19 infections.&#xD;
      However, there appears to be a high level of vaccine hesitancy among women of reproductive&#xD;
      age. We will develop &quot;nudge&quot; interventions to improve influenza and COVID vaccine uptake&#xD;
      among pregnant women and medically at risk children and test the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      interventions using randomised controlled trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women and children with chronic medical conditions are at an unacceptable risk of&#xD;
      hospitalisation and death from influenza and COVID-19 infections. Pregnant women are 3 times&#xD;
      more likely to die from COVID-19 and over 7 times more likely to be admitted to an intensive&#xD;
      care unit (ICU) with influenza compared to non-pregnant women. Children with chronic disease&#xD;
      are already compromised with a higher risk of hospitalisation from influenza and requirement&#xD;
      for ICU management and long term disability following COVID-19. Uptake of the recommended&#xD;
      influenza vaccine among pregnant women and medically at risk children in Australia is only&#xD;
      ~50%. Based on recent surveys, the predicted uptake of COVID-19 vaccine among both groups is&#xD;
      also likely to be ~50%. These two groups preferentially receive care from medical specialists&#xD;
      (obstetricians and paediatricians) and specialist nursing staff in hospitals, and are less&#xD;
      likely to engage with primary care, the usual providers of immunisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to develop a nudge (i.e. small changes in the environment that&#xD;
      alter people's behaviour) and evaluate the effectiveness of the nudge intervention in&#xD;
      improving the uptake of COVID and influenza vaccine among pregnant women and medically at&#xD;
      risk children by conducting four randomised control trials.&#xD;
