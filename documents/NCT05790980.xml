  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The thalassemias are a group of inherited hematologic disorders caused by defects in the&#xD;
      synthesis of one or more of the hemoglobin chains [1]. Thalassemia are classified into the&#xD;
      alpha (α) and (β) thalassemia, which contain deficits in (α) and (β) globin production&#xD;
      respectively (α)thalassemia are caused by decreased production of alpha-globin chains from&#xD;
      chromosome 16. There are 4 types of (α) thalassemia: thalassemia silent carrier thalassemia&#xD;
      carrier . Hemoglobin H disease thalassemia major Beta-thalassemia are caused by point&#xD;
      mutations or more rarely deletions in the β-globin gene on chromosome 11, leading to reduced&#xD;
      (β+) or absent (β0) synthesis of the β chains of hemoglobin. Imbalances of globin chains&#xD;
      cause hemolysis and impair erythropoiesis [4-7]. β-thalassemia can be classified into: Beta&#xD;
      Thalassemia major, Beta Thalassemia intermedia, Beta Thalassemia minor Thalassemia is a&#xD;
      chronic disease that presents a range of serious clinical and psychological challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of thalassemia on physical health can lead to physical deformity, growth&#xD;
      retardation, and delayed puberty [9, 10]. Its impact on physical appearance, e.g., bone&#xD;
      deformities and short stature, also contributes to a poor self-image [10, 11]. Severe&#xD;
      complications such as heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, liver disease, endocrine&#xD;
      complications, and infections are common among thalassemia patients [8, 12].&#xD;

      The problems mentioned do not only affect patients' physical functioning but also their&#xD;
      emotional functioning, social functioning and school functioning, leading to impaired&#xD;
      Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the patients [13]. QOL is a phrase used to refer to&#xD;
      an individual's total wellbeing. This includes all emotional, social, and physical aspects of&#xD;
      the individual's life. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) Moreover, the term&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is often described as: &quot;A term referring to the health&#xD;
      aspects of quality of life, generally considered to reflect the impact of disease and&#xD;
      treatment on disability and daily functioning; it has also been considered to reflect the&#xD;
      impact of perceived health on an individual's ability to live a fulfilling life.[18-19] HRQOL&#xD;
      is comprised of a number of dimensions of influence. Seven are commonly agreed upon&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical well-being: the experience of physical symptoms such as pain, dyspnea, or&#xD;
           nausea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Functional well-being: the ability to participate in normal daily activities such as&#xD;
           work and leisure pursuits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Emotional well-being: this is comprised of both positive affective states (e.g.&#xD;
           happiness, peace of mind) and negative affective states (e.g. sadness, anxiety).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Family well-being: the ability to maintain family relationships and communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Social functioning: the ability to participate and enjoy social roles and&#xD;
           activities.[20]&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Treatment satisfaction: including financial concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Sexuality/intimacy: including concerns about body image.&#xD;
