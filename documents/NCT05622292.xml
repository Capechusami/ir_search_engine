    <textblock>
      HARKIT I-Care is a mobile application developed by the National Cardiovascular Center Harapan&#xD;
      Kita (NCCHK) to leverage patients in achieving their targets for the secondary prevention of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases. The application contains various features, including exercise&#xD;
      tracking and reminder, medication reminder, and updated educational content on cardiovascular&#xD;
      health. Additionally, patients can log and record their blood pressure, heart rate, smoking&#xD;
      behavior, Quality of Life, and laboratory parameters such as blood sugar and cholesterol. Our&#xD;
      research aims to investigate whether implementing this app in post-acute coronary syndrome&#xD;
      patients could improve their survival rate, hospitalization rate, medication adherence, and&#xD;
      Quality of Life, along with improving their laboratory parameters to be within desirable&#xD;
      targets.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Design: This study is a single-blinded, randomized clinical trial conducted in the National&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita, and aims to investigate the effect of the mobile&#xD;
      application &quot;HARKIT I-Care&quot; on the morbidity and mortality of post-acute coronary syndrome&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Post-ACS patients hospitalized at the National Cardiovascular Center who are&#xD;
      willing to be a subject in this research and have signed the informed consent form. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited and randomized to two groups: I-Care and control. Subjects in the&#xD;
      I-Care group will be instructed to download 'HARKIT I-Care' application on their smartphone.&#xD;
      Subjects will then be taught how to use the application, including logging blood pressure,&#xD;
      blood sugar, and cholesterol levels, making use of exercise and medication reminders, and&#xD;
      where to access health information and teleconsultation. Subjects are instructed to log their&#xD;
      health parameters regularly according to the guidebook that has been prepared beforehand.&#xD;
      Subjects in the control group will receive education on medication compliance and health&#xD;
      information at the beginning of the enrolment. Education was conducted by another research&#xD;
      team not involved in assessing outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: We conducted stratified permutated block random sampling using a computer&#xD;
      application. Stratification used were: (1) Gender: male and female, (2) Age: &lt;65 and â‰¥65, and&#xD;
      (3) Diagnosis: STEMI (ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction), NSTEMI (Non-ST-segment Elevation&#xD;
      Myocardial Infarction), and UAP (Unstable Angina Pectoris). Randomization was conducted using&#xD;
      a computer app, and patient assignments were done using a sealed opaque envelope containing&#xD;
      the assignment group. Randomization was conducted by a study statistician not involved in&#xD;
      data collection. Outcome assessors were blinded to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis plan: We planned on conducting a survival analysis for MACE (major&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular events), cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, and&#xD;
      rehospitalization rate. We also intended to analyze the effect of HARKIT I-Care on medication&#xD;
      compliance, laboratory parameters, smoking cessation and relapse, sodium consumption, and&#xD;
      physical activity.&#xD;
