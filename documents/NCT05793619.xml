      CS5_8 study aim to evaluate the tolerance and to adjust the mode of administration of 2&#xD;
      different conditions of cryotherapy treatments applied on the brown spots of the face with 1&#xD;
      prototype (816-v1). Each treatment corresponds to a specific frequency of cryogenic spray&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the following prototype :&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Prototypes from (816-v1 301) to (816-v1 355)&#xD;

      Rational :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solar/senile lentigo is a harmless patch of darkened skin. It results from exposure to&#xD;
      ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which causes local proliferation of melanocytes and accumulation&#xD;
      of melanin within the skin cells (keratinocytes). Solar/senile lentigos or lentigines are&#xD;
      very common, especially in people over the age of 40 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solar/senile lentigines are found as groups of similar lesions on sun-exposed sites,&#xD;
      particularly the face or the back of hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryotherapy is more and more used to improve skin appearance and currently used to treat&#xD;
      lentigo spot. However, the cryogenic gas (conventional cryotherapy - liquid nitrogen) creates&#xD;
      a dermabrasion of the skin surface and person receiving this kind of treatment presents an&#xD;
      impaired skin during a few days following the treatment as temporary damage of stratum&#xD;
      corneum, erythema, scars, burns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the side effects occurring after conventional cryotherapy application, the Sponsor&#xD;
      has developed some devices using difluoroethane, manufactured by CRYONOVE PHARMA, already&#xD;
      available on the local and international markets, e.g. CRYOBEAUTY MAINS and CRYOBEAUTY CORPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To continue it research and development activities, the sponsor selected other sequences of a&#xD;
      cryogenic spray (1 prototype of devices for face used according to different frequencies of&#xD;
      application, i.e. 2 conditions evaluated) which could be used for lentigo treatment with a&#xD;
      same benefit for the consumers without any safety outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study performed is a proof of performance designed to be exploratory, interventional&#xD;
      study, monocentric, randomized and double blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention :&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 prototype of devices are evaluated in 2 different conditions. Each treatment corresponds to&#xD;
      a specific frequency of cryogenic spray application. A total of 42 brown spots are needed (at&#xD;
      least 1 brown spot on the face).The 42 brown spots will be randomized between the 2&#xD;
      conditions and will be attributed to subjects according to the number of spots identified by&#xD;
      Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prototypes (816-v1 301) to (816-v1 355) will be applied on brown pots located on the face.&#xD;
      Each spot will be treated six times by a defined prototype (always the same device on the&#xD;
      same spot all along the study) according to specific frequencies (every week or every two&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to any study device application, the dermatologist will assess the adverse events and&#xD;
      will decide if the period between two consecutive applications should be extended or not.The&#xD;
      dermatologist will verify that the skin has not been treated by cosmetic products (no&#xD;
      presence of cream that could interfere with the treatment) and is dry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study will use prototypes, before each treatment, the prototype will be administered&#xD;
      to any surface (in order to purge eventually the presence of air). An operator previously&#xD;
      trained by the dermatologist will apply the study device to the patient's face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be lying down, and the device will be administered upside down. During&#xD;
      applications on the face, subjects will wear diving goggles protecting the eyes from&#xD;
      cryogenic gas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient follow-up visits are from Day 0 to 6 months.&#xD;
