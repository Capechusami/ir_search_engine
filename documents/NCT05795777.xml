  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pressure sore was localized skin and/or subcutaneous tissue injury, usually caused by&#xD;
      pressure alone or a combination of shear and pressure, at bony prominences. Pressure sores,&#xD;
      which are an indicator of the quality of health care, increase mortality, morbidity and cost.&#xD;
      Pressure ulcers are the most common problem in intensive care patients and should be&#xD;
      prevented. In the literature, the incidence of pressure ulcers in intensive care patients is&#xD;
      between 1-59.9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pressure sore is a localized injury to the skin and/or underlying soft tissue, usually over&#xD;
      a bony prominence or associated with medical or other devices. This injury occurs when&#xD;
      intense and/or prolonged pressure or pressure is accompanied by shear. Soft tissue tolerance&#xD;
      to pressure and shear; temperature and humidity can affect nutrition, perfusion, concomitant&#xD;
      conditions, and condition of soft tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was carried out to determine the prevalence of pressure ulcers and influencing&#xD;
      factors in patients hospitalized in the 3rd level intensive care unit of a university&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: It is a descriptive, prospective, observational type study. Materials and Methods:&#xD;
      The sample of the study consisted of 176 patients aged 18 years and above, 24 hours after&#xD;
      hospitalization in the intensive care units of a University Hospital. Patient Information&#xD;
      Form and Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Ulcer Risk, Glasgow Coma Scale were used to&#xD;
      collecting data. Statistical Package in statistical analysis for the social sciences 20.0&#xD;
      program was used.&#xD;

      Due to the renovation initiated in the intensive care units, the work was started in November&#xD;
      2019, but the working time was extended due to the Covid 19 pandemic that developed&#xD;
      immediately after. The sample of the study consisted of patients who met the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and accepted participation, among the patients who were hospitalized on Wednesday,&#xD;
      which was determined as the middle of each week, between November 2019 and February 2021 in&#xD;
      the 3rd-level intensive care units of a university hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: &quot;Personal Information Form&quot; prepared by the researcher as a result of the&#xD;
      literature review for data collection, &quot;Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Ulcer Risk&quot; for&#xD;
      evaluating pressure ulcers, &quot;Glasgow Coma Score&quot; for evaluating patient's consciousness&#xD;
      status, and ulcer used by National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel and European Pressure Ulcer&#xD;
      Advisory Panel staging classification was used.&#xD;

    <description>The sample of the study consisted of patients who were hospitalized in the tertiary intensive care unit of a university hospital between November 2019 and February 2021, who met the inclusion criteria and accepted to participate in the study. Data were collected from patients every Wednesday, which was determined as the middle of the week. Patients were evaluated with the Braden Scale for Predicting Pressure Ulcer Risk. The total score of the scale varies between 6-23 points. As the scores obtained from the scale decrease, the risk of developing pressure ulcers increases. A scale score of 9 or less indicates a high risk, and a scale score of 19-23 indicates no risk.&#xD;
Data collection from each patient took 15 minutes.</description>
