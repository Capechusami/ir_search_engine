  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Youth unemployment is a chronic problem in most societies. Some young adults are neither in&#xD;
      employment, eduction or training (NEET), and are at high risk of chronic unemployment, social&#xD;
      disengagement and poor quality of life. Identifying this high risk population and providing&#xD;
      them with career skills training and opportunities is critical for their full participation&#xD;
      in society. Vocational training programs provide an opportunity for these NEET youth to&#xD;
      develop a skilled trade. Barriers to successful completion of these programs include high&#xD;
      prevalence of mental health and substance use disorders among NEET youth. This study will use&#xD;
      a daily self-report distress tool to identify vocational program trainees at risk of absence&#xD;
      or drop-out due to mental health and/or substance abuse issues. These at-risk trainees will&#xD;
      then be referred to a mental health crisis program through a fit-for-purpose referral process&#xD;
      to accommodate their training program requirements. It is hypothesized that early&#xD;
      identification and referral for mental health and substance abuse issues will reduce both&#xD;
      program absence and drop-out rates and result in improved in long-term employment for these&#xD;
      NEET youth.&#xD;

      The Trades &amp; Diversity Training Program (TDTP) is a Canadian federal government-funded&#xD;
      vocational construction skills training program for visible minority &amp; female youth who are&#xD;
      chronically under- and unemployed. The TDTP is a 12-week program that includes both&#xD;
      in-classroom education and supervised hands-on experiential learning at participating&#xD;
      construction sites. The trainees are supported by a case manager who identifies, plans and&#xD;
      co-ordinates support services to minimize program absences and drop-out. The most significant&#xD;
      barriers to successful program completion and long-term employment are mental health and&#xD;
      substance use disorders. Historically, identification and rapid referral to mental health and&#xD;
      addiction services has been difficult due to human resource limitations and limited access to&#xD;
      timely healthcare services. This study will randomize cohorts enrolled in each 12-week&#xD;
      training program located in 2 sites to the use of a self-report distress tool versus usual&#xD;
      case management. The distress tool is a web-based self-reporting tool that is accessed by&#xD;
      trainees on a daily basis to report their distress levels, the underlying reasons for this&#xD;
      distress and whether this distress will prevent them from attending class or put them at-risk&#xD;
      for drop-out. For those individuals whose distress levels threaten their program&#xD;
      participation, the case manager is alerted immediately via an email notification. The case&#xD;
      manager is then responsible for connecting with the trainees and engaging the rapid referral&#xD;
      process for mental health and addictions healthcare services. The control cohorts will&#xD;
      receive the usual case management approach of engaging students on an intermittent basis and&#xD;
      providing support as needed.&#xD;
