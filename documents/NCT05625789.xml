  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand the treatment approach (i.e., targeting gait or&#xD;
      targeting the postural adjustment prior to gait) that is most effective at improving gait&#xD;
      initiation dynamics in people with Parkinson disease. Ten adults with idiopathic Parkinson&#xD;
      disease who self-report difficulty initiating gait will complete the study. The investigators&#xD;
      will be using a randomized crossover design, where the participants will participate in two&#xD;
      series of training (i.e., postural training and steady-state gait training) with a one-week&#xD;
      washout between trainings. Investigators will evaluate the changes induced in gait initiation&#xD;
      postural adjustment size, first step length, and first step speed from each intervention. Due&#xD;
      to the anticipated limitation of steady-state walking to directly address postural adjustment&#xD;
      amplitude, it is hypothesized that training for larger amplitude weight shift during gait&#xD;
      initiation will yield improved gait initiation dynamics compared to training with large&#xD;
      amplitude movements during steady-state walking.&#xD;

    <description>For postural control training, participants will be provided visual biofeedback to increase weight shift prior to the first step. The feedback program cues participants to reach a target amount of weight shift. Once the target is reached, participants are cued to initiate walking. Participants will complete a total of 30 minutes of training, ensuring at least 45 repetitions.&#xD;
To create larger amplitude movements during steady state gait, participants will walk on a treadmill set to their comfortable gait speed while attempting to match their steps to a metronome beeping at 85% of their comfortable cadence. Participants will complete a total of 10 minutes of treadmill walking with rest breaks as needed. Next, participants will walk overground to a metronome beeping at 115% of their comfortable cadence with a goal of 10 total minutes of training.&#xD;
Each training will be three times per week for two weeks. There is a one week break between the two trainings.</description>
