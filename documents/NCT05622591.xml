  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study focuses on a rare type of acute myeloid leukemia (with the subtype&#xD;
      CBFA2T3::GLIS2 that overexpresses folate receptor alpha (FRα) (a protein on the surface of&#xD;
      leukemia cells)) that has relapsed or is refractory. Relapse means the cancer has come back&#xD;
      after treatment. Refractory means the cancer does not respond to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELU001 is a new chemical entity described as a C'Dot drug conjugate (CDC), consisting of&#xD;
      payloads (exatecans) and targeting moieties (folic acid analogs) covalently bound by linkers&#xD;
      to the C'Dot particle carrier. ELU001 will be the first drug-conjugate of its kind to be&#xD;
      introduced into the clinic, a first in class, and a novel molecular entity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Treatment will be given for 2 cycles of 28 days, for a total treatment of 2 months. At the&#xD;
      end of each treatment cycle, there is an evaluation to see how the leukemia is responding to&#xD;
      therapy. After completing two cycles, patients may enter into the Optional Treatment&#xD;
      Continuation Period if the doctor believes that there is clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Dose Escalation Safety Study to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or&#xD;
      the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). This study will also evaluate the tolerability of&#xD;
      ELU001. The drug is given by an infusion through a vein over a period of about one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELU001 is not a drug approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) yet. But it is&#xD;
      believed that ELU001 could play a role in stopping this type of leukemia from getting worse&#xD;
      and offer a treatment option that may have less side effects. This is because it focuses on&#xD;
      leukemic cells that have increased levels of FRα more than it targets healthy cells which&#xD;
      express normal or no FRα.&#xD;
