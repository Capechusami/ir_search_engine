    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate the impact of an integrated intervention of daily maternal calcium,&#xD;
      aspirin, and multiple micronutrients (CAMMS) compared to iron-folic acid (IFA) during&#xD;
      pregnancy on preterm birth and other adverse birth outcomes. Both interventions will be&#xD;
      delivered through existing antenatal service platforms using context-specific strategies&#xD;
      informed by formative research incorporating human-centered design processes to achieve high&#xD;
      acceptability and high adherence, in three low-income countries with diverse contexts:&#xD;
      Burkina Faso, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CAMMS trial is an individually randomized, unblinded, phase III trial comparing aspirin,&#xD;
      calcium and multiple micronutrients (intervention) versus iron-folic acid (control) among&#xD;
      12,000 pregnant women. The primary outcome is total preterm birth, stratified by spontaneous&#xD;
      and indicated. Eligible pregnant women will be enrolled from antenatal clinics in three study&#xD;
      populations in Burkina Faso, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe following written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women attending antenatal care (ANC) who are positive on a urine pregnancy test and have&#xD;
      a fetal ultrasound examination confirming fetal heartbeat, intrauterine pregnancy, and&#xD;
      gestational age 6&lt;20 weeks' will be eligible for enrollment. Women who are &lt;6 weeks will be&#xD;
      rescheduled for 2-3 weeks later. Baseline data and clinical assessments will be conducted,&#xD;
      and women will be randomized to daily ingestion of CAMMS or IFA until delivery. In Burkina&#xD;
      Faso, for women randomized to CAMMS, the aspirin will be withheld until 13 weeks' gestation&#xD;
      when it can be initiated concurrently with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Women will receive&#xD;
      context-specific adherence promotion interventions designed during formative research&#xD;
      incorporating Human-Centered Design (HCD) processes in each country. Mothers will be&#xD;
      encouraged to attend 8 routine antenatal visits according to the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO)-recommended schedule (12, 20, 26, 30, 34, 36, 38, 40 weeks' gestation), plus an&#xD;
      additional study contact (by visit, phone call, WhatsApp, or text message) at 1-2 weeks after&#xD;
      starting the study drug to check for tolerance and adherence. Women will be encouraged to&#xD;
      deliver in a health institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between baseline and delivery, research procedures will be undertaken by research staff based&#xD;
      at antenatal clinics during mothers' routine antenatal visits to reduce time burden on&#xD;
      participants. Across the three trial sites, 10 research visits (the eight WHO-recommended&#xD;
      visits, delivery, and 42 days postpartum) will be undertaken. One additional visit or contact&#xD;
      by text-message (SMS) or phone call will occur one-two weeks after randomization to check&#xD;
      that the women is tolerating and correctly taking the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At delivery, infant weight and gestational age will be measured/determined by research staff&#xD;
      based at delivery clinics or, for home deliveries, during home visits conducted within 72&#xD;
      hours of delivery. For infants born outside the study area or who are not reached by research&#xD;
      staff within 72 hours, date of birth and birth weight will be transcribed from the infant's&#xD;
      health record with source of information noted. In unusual situations where the mother and&#xD;
      infant cannot be reached in person before 180 days postpartum but can be reached by&#xD;
      telephone, WhatsApp, or Text message, maternal report of data of birth and birth weight will&#xD;
      be recorded with the source of information noted. For all infants reached by a research staff&#xD;
      member within 72 hours of birth, birth length and head circumference will be measured by&#xD;
      standardized research staff with high quality equipment (length measured to nearest 0.1cm&#xD;
      with Seca 417 infantometer and Seca 212 Head circumference tape (Weigh &amp; Measure LLC., Olney,&#xD;
      MD, USA). Mothers and infants will be followed to 42 days post-partum for vital status and&#xD;
      post-partum maternal Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). This visit may&#xD;
      be conducted in person, by telephone, WhatsApp or text message with the source of information&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
