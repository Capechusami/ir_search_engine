  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to investigate the MBSR feasibility and its effects in old&#xD;
      Portuguese-speaking adults living in Luxemburg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a two-arm randomized-double blinded-controlled study, including 90 healthy&#xD;
      older adults. The MBSR will be conducted in groups over a total of eight weeks, incorporating&#xD;
      weekly meetings, a retreat of 4 hours, and extra activities to be practiced at home. The&#xD;
      active control condition will be a program with different components such as painting,&#xD;
      nutrition information, physical activity, cognitive enhancement, risk factors for dementia,&#xD;
      and health promotion. Neuropsychological assessments will be conducted at baseline,&#xD;
      immediately after and one-month post-intervention. The researchers will also do pre-post&#xD;
      salivary cortisol and resting heart rate variability analyses, as surrogate measures to&#xD;
      assess stress level.&#xD;

    <description>The MBSR is an eight-week group-based psychoeducational program. It is performed in weekly group sessions with the duration of 2.5 hours and a half-day retreat of 4 hours.&#xD;
The program involves focused attention, consisting of body scan, yoga, and meditation. This program trains participants to be attentive to their thoughts, emotions, and sensations. There are also discussions on relevant topics related to the physiology of stress and strategies of coping. Materials for home practice are provided.</description>
