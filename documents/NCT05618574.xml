    <textblock>
      Potential benefits of a nitrate juice supplement to improve skeletal muscle function and&#xD;
      associated physical capacity will be studied in patients with Long COVID. Consenting patients&#xD;
      with Long-COVID will be randomized to receive Beet-It nitrate beverage group versus a&#xD;
      nitrate-depleted placebo beverage. Both groups will receive physical therapy at the long&#xD;
      COVID Clinic at VAPHS with therapeutic goals to improve strength, balance, inspiratory, and&#xD;
      aerobic capabilities. Physical therapy will last for 2 weeks and include 2 or 3 sessions with&#xD;
      a physical therapist a week depending on each individual's exercise tolerance. These sessions&#xD;
      can take place on-site or at home (or a hybrid combination) All participants will undergo&#xD;
      functional assessments and tissue assessments before and after the 14-day study intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a proof of concept pilot, the investigators will study 40 Veterans with long COVID,&#xD;
      comparing 20 who consume two weeks of daily nitrate-rich beetroot juice versus matched&#xD;
      Veterans who consume a nitrate-depleted placebo. Nitrate is metabolized to increase cellular&#xD;
      nitric oxide once it is ingested. Nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule that contributes&#xD;
      to numerous physiological functions, including enhanced skeletal muscle mitochondrial&#xD;
      respiration, which may thereby lead to decreased fatigability and increased physical&#xD;
      function. NO is commonly produced from the conversion of the amino acid L-arginine to&#xD;
      L-citrulline in the presence of oxygen. However, inorganic nitrate provided as a dietary&#xD;
      supplement can serve as an additional substrate for bioactive nitrite and downstream NO,&#xD;
      particularly during the ischemic stress of exercise. In this study, consenting patients with&#xD;
      Long-COVID will be randomized to receive Beet-It nitrate beverage group as a source of&#xD;
      inorganic nitrites and NO, versus a nitrate-depleted placebo beverage. Both groups will&#xD;
      undergo simultaneous physical therapy. Primary endpoints center on meaningful clinical&#xD;
      changes, including fatigability (i.e., rating of perceived exertion during steady-state&#xD;
      walking), cardiorespiratory fitness (i.e., peak oxygen utilization [VO2] as well as&#xD;
      submaximal VO2 at anaerobic threshold [VAT]). In addition, serology and skeletal muscle&#xD;
      assessments will include nitrate and nitrite levels and mitochondrial respiration to analyze&#xD;
      nitrite-mediated mechanisms underlying functional changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal investigator Daniel Forman, MD has developed expertise in nitrite therapeutics&#xD;
      using nitrite capsule supplements for older sedentary adults in relation to sedentariness and&#xD;
      heart failure. This SPiRE proposal focuses nitrite therapeutics to both younger and older&#xD;
      adults with long COVID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to study the benefits of beetroot juice&#xD;
      versus placebo in 40 Veterans with prior COVID-19 infection (within one year) and who have&#xD;
      been left with residual symptoms of long COVID. All participants will receive a daily study&#xD;
      juice intervention for 2 weeks in association with physical therapy with a standardized&#xD;
      exercise regimen designed to increase strength and aerobic function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1: To study the efficacy of nitrite supplementation to reduce fatigability over two&#xD;
           weeks as measured by rating of perceived exertion (RPE) during submaximal steady-state&#xD;
           1.5 mile per hour walking. Walking efficiency (VO2 per kg) will also be assessed during&#xD;
           steady-state walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2: To study the benefits of nitrite supplementation to increase cardiorespiratory&#xD;
           fitness (peak oxygen utilization [VO2], VO2 at anaerobic threshold (VAT), 6-minute walk&#xD;
           distance (6MWD), short physical performance battery (SPPB), and pulmonary function tests&#xD;
           (PFT) after two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3: To explore the utility of nitrite supplementation to enhance skeletal muscle&#xD;
           mitochondrial respiration in long COVID patients as measured by ex vivo Oroboros&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
