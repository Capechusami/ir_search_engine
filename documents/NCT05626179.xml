  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the mass balance of single oral dose of [14C] IBI351 in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Six to eight healthy male subjects were planned to be enrolled. After passing the&#xD;
      screening, subjects were admitted to hospital and received training on medication, urine and&#xD;
      feces collection and other procedures to ensure that they could perform relevant operations&#xD;
      according to the protocol and SOP requirements. On the evening before medication, the patient&#xD;
      had standard meals, and fasted uniformly overnight. On D1, the suspension containing&#xD;
      recommended dose of [14C] IBI351 was administered in the morning on an empty stomach.&#xD;
      Subjects have standardized meal during the trial and blood, urine, and feces samples were&#xD;
      collected and safety laboratory tests were performed as scheduled.&#xD;
