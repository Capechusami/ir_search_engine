    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase 1 study with expansion. The study will start with a dose&#xD;
      escalation of single-agent ABSK121-NX administered in repeated 28-day cycles in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors to evaluate safety and tolerability. The expansion part will&#xD;
      investigate oral ABSK121-NX at the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) to further evaluate&#xD;
      safety and tolerability among selected tumor types. Preliminary antitumor activity will also&#xD;
      be assessed.&#xD;

      Escalation Part:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation of oral ABSK121-NX will be guided by the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN)&#xD;
      design based on safety data collected until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum&#xD;
      administered dose (MAD) has been identified. During the dose escalation part of the study,&#xD;
      patients will receive a single dose of ABSK121 on Day -7 followed by a 7-day washout (Day -7&#xD;
      dosing day as 1st day of wash out) as a run-in period to access the safety and PK of&#xD;
      ABSK121-NX. Then, patients will continuously receive ABSK121-NX once daily (QD) beginning at&#xD;
      C1D1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation will start at 3 mg QD followed by dose escalation of a total of 8&#xD;
      potential dose levels. Once RDE is determined, an RDE-confirmation group of up to 24 more&#xD;
      patients may be enrolled at the selected dose levels to further evaluate safety and efficacy&#xD;
      (up to 12 per dose level/regimen), if approved by the sponsor. In addition, a preliminary&#xD;
      food-effect (FE) may be evaluated in Cycle 1 D15 or later in at least 6 patients from the&#xD;
      RDE- confirmation part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the RDE is determined in the dose escalation part, the dose expansion phase will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion Part:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When health authorities outside US require that the safety data in the local population be&#xD;
      provided prior to the expansion part, a minimum of 3 local subjects will be enrolled and&#xD;
      treated at the selected RDE dose level first in that country/region to evaluate the&#xD;
      tolerability of ABSK121-NX. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for escalation part will&#xD;
      apply for these subjects. After similar safety and tolerability of ABSK121-NX in patients in&#xD;
      the relevant locality have been confirmed by local Investigators and the Sponsor, additional&#xD;
      patients will be allowed to enroll in the expansion part.&#xD;
