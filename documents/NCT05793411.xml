      Little is known about the prevalence of risk behaviors (RBs), in adolescents living with a&#xD;
      chronic condition (CC) Objectives Main objective: To characterize the engagement of&#xD;
      adolescents with somatic CC recognized as ALD (SCC-ALD) into RBs, compared to the French GP&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify factors associated with RBs in adolescents with somatic CC-ALD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To elicit strategies of preventive action of RBs in adolescents with somatic CC-ALD&#xD;
           Methods multicenter, cross-sectional survey , based on a mixed qualitative-quantitative&#xD;
           approach with an explanatory sequential design (2 consecutive steps): STEP 1 :&#xD;
           QUANTITATIVE COMPONENT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  N expected =500&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inclusion criteria : 14 to 18 years, With a SCC-ALD,Without cognitive impairment&#xD;
                and/or psychiatric disease&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pseudonymised self-administered paper questionnaire (50 items) completed by&#xD;
                eligible adolescents during a visit at referring hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  statistical analysis : Comparative to the French GP: matching with two datasets&#xD;
                (Enclass-HBSC 2022 and Portraits d'Adolescents 2013 surveys); identification of&#xD;
                risk factors and risk subgroups STEP 2 : QUALITATIVE COMPONENT: Focus groups of&#xD;
                adolescents with somatic CC-ALD (5 focus groups of 6-8 adolescents, conducted by a&#xD;
                researcher in SHS) Perspectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      CARMAC will :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide a better understanding of RBs in adolescents with severe somatic CC and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Help develop strategies to prevent RBs to enhance the strategies of reducing the&#xD;
           addictions to psychoactive substances and health inequalities in this population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serve as a methodological model for future studies&#xD;
