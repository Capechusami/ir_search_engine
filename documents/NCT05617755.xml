  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label phase 1 dose escalation trial that uses a modified 3+3&#xD;
      design to identify a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AB-1015 cell product. Backfill&#xD;
      cohorts will enroll additional subjects at doses deemed to be safe for a total enrollment of&#xD;
      up to 12 subjects per each backfill cohort on the protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is intended for the patients who have been diagnosed with Epithelial Ovarian&#xD;
      Cancer that either came back or did not improve after platinum treatments (platinum&#xD;
      resistant). The purpose of this study is to test the safety of using a new treatment called&#xD;
      Integrated Circuit T (ICT) cells (AB-1015 cells) in patients with ovarian cancer. This&#xD;
      treatment has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to calculate the maximum tolerated dose of the AB-1015 cells. T&#xD;
      cells are part of the immune system that protect the body from infection and may help fight&#xD;
      cancer. The T cells given in this study will come from the patient and will have a genetic&#xD;
      circuit/logic gate put in them that makes them able to recognize alkaline phosphatase, germ&#xD;
      line/placental (ALPG/P) and mesothelin (MSLN), 2 proteins on the surface of tumor cells.&#xD;
      These logic-gated T cells may help the body's immune system identify and kill cancer cells&#xD;
      while sparing normal healthy tissues from toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AB-1015 cells are given intravenously, after completing 3 rounds of conditioning&#xD;
      chemotherapy administered over 3 consecutive days. Conditioning chemotherapy prepares the&#xD;
      body to receive the AB-1015 cells. If they continue to meet the eligibility criteria, AB-1015&#xD;
      cells will be given to them 2 days after the last conditioning chemotherapy round. A single&#xD;
      infusion of the AB-1015 cells will be given to the subject intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed with serial measurements of&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a research study to obtain new information that may help people in the future.&#xD;
