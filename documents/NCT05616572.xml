    <time_frame>Prior to OncoWhiz and after OncoWhiz (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety will be quantified by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Form. Participants will answer 40 questions regarding how they generally feel. There are 2 subscales within this assessment, both consisting of 20 separate items on a 4-point scale. The State Anxiety Scale (Y-1) evaluates the current state of anxiety while the Trait Anxiety Scale (Y-2) evaluates anxiety-proneness as a personality trait. A higher score indicates greater anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>Prior to OncoWhiz and after OncoWhiz (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The knowledge assessment consists of 20 multiple choice questions related to caregiving for children with cancer. The percentage of questions answered correctly before and after utilization of the tool will be compared.</description>

The study visit will consist of a brief set of demographic questions and a pre-game play knowledge assessment and anxiety assessment, followed by completion of the OncoWhiz game. Immediately after utilizing OncoWhiz, the participant will complete a knowledge assessment and anxiety assessment, in addition to a satisfaction survey.</description>
