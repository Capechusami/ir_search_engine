  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational study is to learn about how a prescribed Exercise Training&#xD;
      Program would affect children living with a Fontan circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From birth, the children who are born with single functioning ventricle will undergo 3-staged&#xD;
      Fontan surgery to achieve a unique Fontan circulation, supported by one functioning&#xD;
      ventricle. With advancement in surgical technique and medical care, there are increasing&#xD;
      number of children living with Fontan circulating surviving into adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant number of these individuals develop complications in their adulthood due to&#xD;
      problems related to this unique circulation, including reduced exercise tolerance, heart&#xD;
      failure, abnormal heart rhythm or premature death. Many of these children have acquired&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyle, and may have lower self-perceived health related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise training is a well-established therapy used in adult population with heart failure.&#xD;
      It has been shown to be safe in children with congenital heart disease and with Fontan&#xD;
      circulation, it improves their aerobic exercise capacity which is associated with better&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main question[s] it aims to answer are the impact of a Exercise Training program on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Single ventricle function&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exercise capacity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Self-perceived quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Skeletal muscle mass&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given a 20-weeks exercise program, 3 sessions of 30 minutes workout&#xD;
      weekly, to carry out at home. The following tests will be performed prior to starting and&#xD;
      upon completion of the exercise program:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiopulmonary exercise test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition scan using a bio-impedance analyser&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life questionnaires&#xD;
