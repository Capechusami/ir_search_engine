    <textblock>
      This trial is an efficacy and safety evaluation of the use of Utidelone injection in&#xD;
      combination with gemcitabine for inoperable and locally inappropriate use first-line&#xD;
      chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Purpose:To evaluate the use of utidelone in combination with gemcitabine in&#xD;
      unresectable, advanced pancreatic cancer without progressionSurvival (PFS), overall survival&#xD;
      (OS), duration of response (DOR), and safety; Secondary objective: Use of utidelone in&#xD;
      combination with gemcitabine in patients with unresectable, advanced pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
      according to investigators Objective response rates (ORRs) assessed against RECIST v1.1&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;

      This trial is a multicenter, single-arm phase II clinical trial of Utidelone (UTD1) injection&#xD;
      combined with gemcitabine in patients with unresectable, advanced pancreatic cancer, and the&#xD;
      study will include 6 centers and enroll 92 patients.Patients who met the entry criteria&#xD;
      received Utidelone in combination with gemcitabine: Utidelone (utidelone ®) injection: 30&#xD;
      mg/m2, administered daily on Days 1-5, in 21-day cycles; gemcitabine: 1000 mg/m2,&#xD;
      administered 3 weeks using (Q3W) on Days 1 and 8, in 21-day cycles; treatment period: 6-8&#xD;
      cycles, or until the patient experienced disease progression or intolerable toxicity or&#xD;
      death.Tumor assessments will be performed at baseline and every 6 weeks (± 7 days) after&#xD;
      enrollment until disease progression according to response evaluation criteria in solid&#xD;
      tumours (RECISTv1.1) criteria.For patients without disease progression, tumor assessments&#xD;
      will continue regardless of whether or not the patient discontinues study treatment unless&#xD;
      consent is withdrawn.Follow-up data collection, including subsequent anticancer therapy, was&#xD;
      to occur until patient death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or study termination,&#xD;
      whichever came first.Safety assessments assessed the incidence, nature, and severity of&#xD;
      adverse events and laboratory abnormalities according to the National Cancer Institute Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0 in the Investigator-Initiated&#xD;
      Clinical Trial (IIT) Study UTD1-PC-01 14 in Shanghai First People 's Hospital.Laboratory&#xD;
      safety assessments included periodic monitoring of hematology and chemistry.&#xD;
