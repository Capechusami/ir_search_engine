      This study aims to determine the incidence, risk factors and outcome of ventilation&#xD;
      associated common complication in the PICUs at Assiut University Children Hospital in Egypt.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A constellation of adverse effects and complications may be associated with mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation,The following are the Commonest Complications of Mechanical Ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ventilator-induced lung injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ventilation induce Hemodynamic compromise leads to ARDS. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia&#xD;
           (VAP) It refers to nosocomial pneumonia occurring 48 hours or more after initiation of&#xD;
           mechanical ventilation (MV)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the second most common HAI after blood stream infection in the paediatric age group,&#xD;
      accounting for about 20% of all HAIs in the paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and has a&#xD;
      rate of 2.9- 21.6 per 1000 ventilator days.The risk factors responsible for VAP occurrence&#xD;
      can be classified into:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A-Host related factors: include associated co-morbidities B-Device-related factors: include&#xD;
      the endotracheal tube, the ventilation circuit, and the presence of a nasogastric or an&#xD;
      orogastric tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-Personnel related factors: include improper hand hygiene and inadequate use of personal&#xD;
      protective equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAP is associated with increased hospital morbidity; mortality; duration of hospitalization&#xD;
      by an average of 7-9 days per patient; and health care costs . The incidence rates of VAP are&#xD;
      higher in developing countries with limited resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) It is the lung damage by application positive or&#xD;
      negative pressure to the lung by mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of VALI in children admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) may&#xD;
      approximate 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Types of VALI:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Voltrauma (This is damage caused by over-distension)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Barotrauma (destructive entry of pressurised airway gases into the parenchyma, or into&#xD;
           blood vessels.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biotrauma (is known to upregulate pulmonary cytokine production)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxygen toxicity (This is the damage caused by a high concentration of inspired oxygen)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment /de-recruitment injury (atelectotrauma)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shearing injury Risk factors for VALI: blood product transfusion, acidaemia, and history&#xD;
           of restrictive lung disease. larger tidal volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      investigators observed lower mortality among children ventilated with Vt ~8 mL/kg actual&#xD;
      bodyweight compared with ~10 mL/kg in a before-after retrospective study .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ventilation induce Hemodynamic compromise leads to ARDS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition: Decrease in mean arterial pressure of 60 mm Hg or an absolute decrease to a&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure &lt; 80 mm Hg in the first 2 hours after intubation, required treatment&#xD;
      for LTH with vasopressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      primary factor influencing mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Incidence:&#xD;
      28.6% of patients intubated in the emergency department developed post-intubation&#xD;
      hypotension, tatistically significant association between LTH and hyper carbic (PCO2 &gt; 50 mm)&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
