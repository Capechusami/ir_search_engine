      This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of a new intervention,&#xD;
      AU409, in treating patients with primary liver cancers that may have spread from where it&#xD;
      first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced) or&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors that have spread to the liver (liver metastatic disease). AU409 may&#xD;
      stop cancer from growing and spreading. This trial may help researchers determine if AU409 is&#xD;
      safe and effective in treating patients with liver cancers and solid tumors with liver&#xD;
      metastatic disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RNA transcription modulator AU-409 (AU409)&#xD;
      and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the safety and tolerability of AU409 by assessing toxicities per Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 5.0 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain a preliminary assessment of anti-tumor activity of AU409 via objective&#xD;
      radiologic response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine pharmacokinetics of AU409 in patients with advanced-stage solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the concentration of AU409 in tumor tissue from liver biopsy samples obtained&#xD;
      from a subset of patients treated with AU409 at dose level 4 (300 mg) and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate expression of genes with TATA box promotion regions on pre- and post-&#xD;
      treatment liver biopsy samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive AU409 orally (PO) on study. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and collection of blood samples throughout the trial.&#xD;

    <description>MTD is defined as the highest dose tested at which none or no more than one patient experienced DLT attributable to the study drug(s), when 6 patients were treated at that dose and are evaluable for toxicity. The MTD is one dose level below the lowest dose tested in which 2 or more patients experienced DLT attributable to the study drug(s.)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Recommended phase II dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The RP2D for evaluation in Phase 2 will be selected based on overall safety and tolerability, PK, preliminary efficacy, and estimates of efficacious liver exposures extrapolated from nonclinical data and Phase 1 of the study. The RP2D may or may not be the same as the MTD identified in Phase 1. For example, if the MTD was not reached with a plateau of exposures despite increasing drug dose, or if exposure at the MTD was much higher than the level expected to be required for efficacy, or if subsequent cycles of treatment provided additional insight on the safety profile, then the RP2D might be different, though not higher dose than the MTD.&#xD;
Additionally, if an MTD is not identified in the dose range expected, a dose that met the tolerability and PK criteria could be selected as the RP2D.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histopathologically /cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumor,&#xD;
             which is refractory to standard therapeutic options, or for which there are no&#xD;
             standard therapeutic options. Failure of all approved therapies that have a marginal&#xD;
             impact on survival is not required as long as the treating physician considers that&#xD;
             treatment on study is appropriate for the subject and documents that the subject&#xD;
             elects to defer the approved therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  During the dose-escalation portion, patients must have primary liver malignancy&#xD;
             (including hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma) OR a solid tumor with liver&#xD;

             burden being in the liver per investigator assessment AND no more than two&#xD;
             extrahepatic sites of disease (site of disease refers to organ or system). During the&#xD;
             dose expansion portion of the study, eligibility may be limited to one or more tumor&#xD;
             types depending on findings from the dose-escalation phase; this will be clarified in&#xD;
             an amendment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0&#xD;

             adverse events (such as hypothyroidism or hypoadrenalism) that are manageable with&#xD;
             replacement therapy are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous chemotherapy/radiotherapy/targeted/immunotherapy therapy should have been&#xD;
             completed at least 4 weeks prior to start of AU409 administration, or five half-lives,&#xD;
             whichever is shorter (except for palliative radiation therapy that should be completed&#xD;
             &gt;= 14 days prior to study entry)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;

             highly effective contraception during the intervention period and for 60 days after&#xD;
             the last dose of AU409 and refrain from donating sperm during this period. WOCBP are&#xD;
             eligible to participate if they are not pregnant, not breastfeeding, and agree to&#xD;
             follow the contraceptive guidance during the study intervention period and for at&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in&#xD;

             the study. Patients with chronic Hepatitis C are allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have active infection requiring treatment (except hepatitis B and C as&#xD;

             interpretation of the results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital&#xD;
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants&#xD;

             inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes should have such medications discontinued&#xD;
             or replaced. Such medications should be avoided for one week prior to first dose of&#xD;
             treatment and during the trial participation. If these medications are absolutely&#xD;
             necessary for the patient and cannot be replaced, enrollment may still be considered&#xD;
             on a case by case basis if it is in the patient's best interest and after discussion&#xD;
             with the principal investigator (PI)&#xD;
