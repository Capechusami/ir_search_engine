      This randomized, double-blind, controlled trial will be conducted at Yueyang Hospital of&#xD;
      Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine affiliated to Shanghai University of&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese Medicine. Trials will begin following ethics approval and protocol&#xD;
      registration. Patient recruitment began in April 2023 and is expected to conclude in June&#xD;
      2024. An estimated 130 participants will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive BSZY Cream&#xD;
      or emulsion base. In the process of developing standard protocols, the Standards for&#xD;
      Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture and Moxibustion (STRICTA) and the&#xD;
      SPIRIT Reporting Guidelines will be followed to clearly and transparently explain the&#xD;
      treatment process involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects were assessed for eligibility for inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will voluntarily provide written informed consent prior to&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a double-blind design. Both BSZY Cream and emulsion base were provided by&#xD;
      the manufacturer, and were distributed by designated research nurses after registration, once&#xD;
      every 2 weeks. Except for the first dispensing, the unused lotion was collected and counted&#xD;
      each time after dispensing.&#xD;

    <description>The SCORAD score was calculated based on the types of lesions and body areas and was assessed separately for the head, neck, arms, legs, anterior trunk, back, and genitalia based on the area of skin involved and the severity of erythema, exudation, crusting, lichenification, and dryness. The scores report the severity of the patients' symptoms, with a total score ranging from 0 to 103, scores of 25 or lower indicating mild severity, scores of 26 to 50 indicating moderate severity, and scores of 51 to 103 indicating severe severity.. Patients were monitored for changes in SCROAD during treatment, observed for improvement in atopic dermatitis, and changes in points were calculated and compared before and after.</description>
