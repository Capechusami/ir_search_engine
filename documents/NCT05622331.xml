      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Estimate the hospital-associated healthcare resource use (HCRU), and associated costs, of&#xD;
      RSV infection in children in comparison to the non-RSV control cohort (general population)&#xD;
      and patients with rhinovirus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe demographic and clinical patient characteristics of RSV infected children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate and compare the incidence of RSV infection and acute respiratory infections&#xD;
           (ARIs) in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the mortality associated with RSV infection in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the social economic burden of RSV infection in children in relation to parents&#xD;
           staying home from work to care for their sick child (VAB leave) in comparison to non-RSV&#xD;
           control cohort (i.e. parents to children in the general population).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Estimate the net days with VAB leave and the compensation disbursed (temporary&#xD;
                parental benefit) associated with RSV infection in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Estimate the indirect costs that can be attributed to VAB leave.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine the medium- and long-term complications associated with an RSV diagnosis in&#xD;
           children in comparison to the non-RSV control chart (general population) and patients&#xD;
           with rhinovirus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine and describe risk factors associated with an RSV infection in children&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the healthcare resource use (HCRU), and associated costs, of RSV infection in&#xD;
           children, for a subset of patients where primary care data is available, in comparison&#xD;
           to the non-RSV control cohort (general population).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall study period will be between July 1st 2001 and to latest available date (likely&#xD;
      June 30th 2022).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified for inclusion in the study population between July 1st 2006 and&#xD;
      June 30th 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed from time of inclusion until end of the study period or until&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have an index date corresponding to the date of diagnosis of incident&#xD;
      infection in primary and/or hospital care during the identification period. An incident&#xD;
      infection is defined as the occurrence of infections more than 30 (&gt;30) days apart. This&#xD;
      implies that a patient can have more than one index date during the study period. Patients&#xD;
      that are included in both the RSV cohort and the regional primary care RSV cohort may have&#xD;
      two different index dates for the same incident infection, depending on the objective. This&#xD;
      is if a patient is first treated in primary care and then hospitalized. The index date is&#xD;
      defined differently for the two cohorts, as the first diagnosis in hospital care for the RSV&#xD;
      cohort and first diagnosis in primary care OR hospital care for the regional primary care&#xD;
      cohort. The non-RSV controls will have the same index date as their matched RSV patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The look-back period will be used to inform baseline characteristics as well as patients'&#xD;
      medical and diagnosis history. All patients will have possible look-back from birth for&#xD;
      information on the patient's hospital care history and from 2005 for information on the&#xD;
      patient's prescribed drugs history. The individual look-back and follow-up will depend on the&#xD;
      time of inclusion in the study population as well as age at inclusion.&#xD;

        The source population for this study will consist of all children (≤5 years of age) in&#xD;
        Sweden with an RSV infection or any acute respiratory infection (ARI) between January 1rst&#xD;
        2001 and latest available date, identified from three sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary or secondary diagnosis in hospital care (National Patient Registry)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary or secondary diagnosis in primary care (regional databases)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive RSV laboratory test result (Regional laboratory data) The expected study&#xD;
             sample is 38,000 unique pediatric patients with an RSV diagnosis, identified in the&#xD;
             National Patient Register between 2001 and 2020. The expected RSV sample size, the&#xD;
             non-RSV control population will consist of 80,000-160,000 individuals, matched 1:10.&#xD;
             The expected number of ARI infections during the time period is estimated to around 1&#xD;
             million. This totals a study sample of between 1-1.1 million.&#xD;
