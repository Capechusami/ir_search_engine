      Randomized Study of the Clinical Efficacy and Safety of Filgrastine® in Patients with Breast&#xD;
      Cancer Treated with Myelotoxic Chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: to evaluate the activity and safety of Filgrastine® in Brazilian patients&#xD;
      undergoing adjuvant treatment for breast cancer, with the frequency of grade 4 neutropenia in&#xD;
      the first cycle of chemotherapy as the primary endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of febrile neutropenia during treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of neutropenia of any degree in the first cycle;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of hospitalization during treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of grade 4 neutropenia in the first treatment cycle;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toxicity during treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunogenicity throughout treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All endpoints will be descriptively analyzed in both groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Randomized (2:1), open-label, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy will be given on the first day of each cycle of treatment, for a maximum of four&#xD;
      to eight cycles, depending on the regimen, patients whose chemotherapy treatment is prolonged&#xD;
      beyond this period being withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated through laboratory tests, including complete blood count,&#xD;
      biochemistry and anti-filgrastim antibodies.&#xD;
