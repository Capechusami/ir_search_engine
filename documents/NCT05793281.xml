  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study in which data from the past of people with solid tumors&#xD;
      harboring an NTRK gene fusion in Japan are studied. In observational studies, only&#xD;
      observations are made without specified advice or interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced or recurrent solid tumor harboring an NTRK gene fusion is a rare type of solid&#xD;
      cancer caused by specific changes in the genes called NTRK gene fusion, and which has spread&#xD;
      to nearby tissues and/or lymph nodes or has returned. Due to this change in the gene, an&#xD;
      altered protein known as a TRK fusion protein is made, which can cause cancer cells to grow&#xD;
      and survive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to learn more about NTRK gene fusion in people in Japan. To&#xD;
      do this, researchers will collect information on the number or percentage of Japanese people&#xD;
      with NTRK gene fusion in any solid tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will come from the national database called C-CAT. They will cover the period from&#xD;
      June 2019 until January 2023.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides this data collection, no further tests or examinations are planned, and no visits are&#xD;
      required in this study.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Availability of this study's data will later be determined according to Bayer's commitment to the EFPIA/PhRMA &quot;Principles for responsible clinical trial data sharing&quot;. This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access. As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014. Interested researchers can use www.vivli.org to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research. Information on the Bayer criteria for listing studies and other relevant information is provided in the member section of the portal.</ipd_description>
