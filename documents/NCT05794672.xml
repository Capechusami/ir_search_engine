  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre study. This&#xD;
      study comprises upto a total of 42 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of two parts: A single dose part (Part A1 and Part A2) and a multiple&#xD;
      dose part (Part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A and Part B will comprise of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each subject will be involved in the study for up to 9 weeks if enrolled in Part A and&#xD;
           up to 10 weeks if enrolled in Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening period of maximum 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment period: Part A: Study treatment Day 1; Part B: Study treatment Days 1 to 6 and&#xD;
           a single inhaled dose on Day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A safety follow-up call will be conducted 7 (± 1) days after elarekibep or placebo&#xD;
           administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A safety follow-up visit will be conducted 30 (± 2) days after elarekibep or placebo&#xD;
           administration in each cohort.&#xD;
