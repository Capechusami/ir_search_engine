    <textblock>
      A prospective study in paediatric, adolescent and young adult patients aged 7 to 18 years to&#xD;
      evaluate the agreement between QTc measured using 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and the&#xD;
      wearable device ECG.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Leveraging existing wearable technology has the ability to scale routine screening&#xD;
      strategies across large populations and can facilitate ambulatory care. In recent years,&#xD;
      wearable technology has rapidly diffused into consumer markets and provides unique&#xD;
      opportunities to engage individuals on health issues of personal interest, and to collect&#xD;
      personal health data. One example of such technology is the ability to perform&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) type traces on wearable devices. However, utilization of this data&#xD;
      source to improve patient outcomes has not been fully realized in the health care field. An&#xD;
      app-based heart ECG algorithm that can be remotely analysed for QTc prolongation with&#xD;
      potential to then notify the user of such potential irregularities could lead to widespread&#xD;
      screening, detection and initiation of treatment solutions (i.e. correction of electrolytes,&#xD;
      alteration of exacerbating medications, cardiac monitoring etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design: This will be a prospective, single arm, experimental, non-significant risk&#xD;
      study conducted with the assistance of eligible participants. Parents or mature minors will&#xD;
      download the Beat to Beat app, once consented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consented the wearable device will be paired to the parent/guardians phone following the&#xD;
      steps provided by the wearable device app. Once the device is paired and the study&#xD;
      coordinator has assisted with the download of 'Beat to Beat' app, the patients will then be&#xD;
      able to commence the ECG readings. A 12 lead ECG will be performed by the study team and&#xD;
      immediately following this, an ECG will be recorded on the wearable device. The wearable&#xD;
      device will be placed on the left wrist for a Lead I reading, on the left lower abdomen for a&#xD;
      Lead II reading and in the fourth intercostal space left parasternal for a chest V2 Lead&#xD;
      reading. Recording of the 12 lead ECG and wearable device ECG will be repeated again 4 days&#xD;
      later. Once both timepoints (and two device recordings for each time period) have been&#xD;
      completed the ECGs will be retrieved from the Beat to Beat app. Both the 12 lead and wearable&#xD;
      device ECG will be de-identified and given a patient identifier before being uploaded into&#xD;
      the REDCap database.&#xD;
