  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, open-label, multi-center, non-comparative, observational study&#xD;
      to assess safety and effectiveness of Jakavi® (ruxolitinib) in the real-world clinical&#xD;
      setting in Korean Graft-versus-Host disease (GvHD) patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dosage and duration of treatment may be considered and decided by the investigator in&#xD;
      accordance with prescribing information of Jakavi®. All participants who receive at least one&#xD;
      dose of the drug and are in the follow-up assessment or early discontinuation (withdrawal)&#xD;
      will be the safety population. This study will enroll patients who are newly starting Jakavi®&#xD;
      and patients who have been taking Jakavi® prior to study participation. Considering the&#xD;
      current clinical practice, a 24 weeks follow-up period of ruxolitinib treatment is needed to&#xD;
      assess the safety and the durable effectiveness of the treatment. Mandatory additional safety&#xD;
      monitoring will be conducted following the last dose of the treatment for further AE&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
