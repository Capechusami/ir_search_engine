  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional dosing of 5-FU is based on body surface area and DPD enzyme activity. However,&#xD;
      BSA-based dosing is associated with wide inter-individual variations in 5-FU systemic&#xD;
      exposure, and also 5-FU-induced toxicity. The international association for therapeutic drug&#xD;
      monitoring and clinical toxicology (IATDMCT) state in there clinical guideline, in which all&#xD;
      previous clinical pharmacokinetic studies of 5-FU were reviewed, that only 25% of the&#xD;
      patients are within the therapeutic range. In the traditional treatment regimens a bolus of&#xD;
      400 mg/ m2 5-FU is given, followed by a dose of 2400 mg/m2 as a 46-hour infusion. The&#xD;
      therapeutic range of 5-FU in these older regimens is defined by a target AUC of 20-30 mg*h/L.&#xD;
      In contrast, 5-FU in FLOT regimen is given without a bolus, and in a high dose of 2600 mg/m2&#xD;
      as a 24-hour infusion. This means that a comparable absolute dose of 5-FU is given with FLOT&#xD;
      and the older regimens, however, the manner and duration of administration differ. Based on&#xD;
      this administration, it is expected that the FLOT regimen will result in an approximately&#xD;
      two-fold higher steady state concentration (Css), as it is given in an approximately two-fold&#xD;
      shorter period of time (t). As a result of this pharmacokinetic predictions, the exposure to&#xD;
      5-FU (AUC = Css x t) will be comparable between these different 5-FU regimens. Therefore, we&#xD;
      hypothesise that the therapeutic range of 5-FU in FLOT will be comparable to the target AUC&#xD;
      of 20-30 mg*h/L in the older regimens. Similar to the older treatment regimens, we expect&#xD;
      that a significant part of patients will be outside this therapeutic window. To test these&#xD;
      hypotheses, the aim of this study is to establish the population exposure of 5-FU in FLOT&#xD;
      treatment regimen, and to determine the percentage of patients that achieves this therapeutic&#xD;
      range.&#xD;
