  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current treatment for patients with secondary antibody deficiency (SAD) is Immunoglobulin&#xD;
      replacement therapy (IGRT). There are currently no clinical guidelines for IGRT&#xD;
      discontinuation in patients with SAD. This study will examine the IGRT discontinuation&#xD;
      success rate and IGRT discontinuation rate in patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IGRT) is a mainstay treatment for SAD and has been shown&#xD;
      to reduce the risk of infection and increase quality of life in patients with SAD. Current&#xD;
      guidelines recommend that patients with severe hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG &lt;4 g/L) or patients&#xD;
      with a history of recurrent or severe infections should be offered IGRT, which can be&#xD;
      administered intravenously on a monthly basis or more frequently by subcutaneous infusions.&#xD;
      There are currently no clinical guidelines for IGRT discontinuation. Although research&#xD;
      conducted at the Ottawa Hospital indicates successful discontinuation of IGRT, clinicians&#xD;
      need a tool to predict the recovery of humoral immunity and the risk of infection in these&#xD;
      patients in order to determine whether IGRT may be safely discontinued.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be tested to determine SMB cell proportion/SMB cell levels for eligibility for IGRT discontinuation. If SMB cells are ≥ 2%, IGRT will be discontinued. If SMB cells are &lt; 2%, the patient will remain on IGRT and a maximum of 40 mL of blood will be drawn again in 3-6 months to reassess SMB levels and eligibility for IGRT discontinuation.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>IGRT discontinuation success rate defined as the proportion of patients with normal SMB levels who stop IGRT and experience less than or equal to 1 moderate infection and no severe infection within 12 months of IGRT discontinuation. Moderate infection will be defined as an infection that requires outpatient oral antimicrobial treatment. Severe infection will be defined as an infection that requires intravenous antimicrobial treatment and/or hospitalization.</description>
