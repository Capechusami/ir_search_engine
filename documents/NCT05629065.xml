  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to increase serious illness conversations (SICs) about patients&#xD;
      goals and preferences regarding their healthcare between patients with cancer and their&#xD;
      oncology clinicians and improved care provided near the end of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to implement an intervention in a pragmatic randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial that uses cancer treatment pathways data to identify patients appropriate&#xD;
      for serious illness conversations (SICs) and applies &quot;nudges&quot; to patients and their oncology&#xD;
      clinicians to increase SICs and improve end of life (EOL) outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identified participants and clinicians will be randomized into 1 or 4 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nudge to patient and clinician&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nudge to patient only&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nudge to clinician only&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No nudge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected enrollment is approximately 800 participants.&#xD;
