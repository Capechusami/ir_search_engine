    <textblock>
      Diabetic painful peripheral neuropathy (DPN) constitutes a serious threat to the outcomes of&#xD;
      patients with diabetes. Yet, the treatments for targeting the underlying nerve damage and&#xD;
      relieving pain are limited. The low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) has been demonstrated&#xD;
      to regulate neuronal activity without any concomitant tissue damage. Studies in animal models&#xD;
      have shown that LIFU could protect nerve cells against inflammation and oxidative stress, as&#xD;
      well as stimulate neurotrophic factor production. In humans, LIFU has been reported to be&#xD;
      effective in relieving peripheral neurogenic pain caused by carpal tunnel syndrome and&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs. Thus, we aim to design a randomized controlled double-blind study by&#xD;
      using LIFU. The primary endpoint is the patient's pain score (NRS), and the secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include Neuropathy Symptom Score (NSS) and Neuropathy Deficit Score (NDS). Through&#xD;
      this study, we anticipate establishing a new method for managing painful DPN.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a major cause of disability and mortality due to&#xD;
      pain, loss of protective sensation, foot ulceration, amputation, and risk of falls, therefore&#xD;
      constituting a serious threat to the outcomes of patients with diabetes and their treatment&#xD;
      costs. The pathogenesis of DPN has been proposed as an inflammatory and oxidative stress&#xD;
      injury in nerve cells caused by glucose and lipid metabolism disorder. Yet, the treatments&#xD;
      for targeting the underlying nerve damage and relieving pain are limited. The widely used&#xD;
      drugs such as Mecobalamine and Lipoic acid are not effective in some patients (about 2/3).&#xD;
      Others, like anticonvulsant (e.g. Dabapentin), antidepressant (e.g. Duloxetine), and central&#xD;
      opioid analgesics (e.g. Tramadol), are effective in the short-term, but they may lead to side&#xD;
      effects for long-term use such as impairment of cognitive function, insomnia, and addiction,&#xD;
      etc. The low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) is regarded as the magnitude of ultrasonic&#xD;
      intensity similar to or below that typically used in diagnostic ultrasound examinations.&#xD;
      Although currently LIFU has not been applied in DPN, a number of studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that it can regulate neuronal activity without any concomitant tissue damage. Studies in&#xD;
      animal models have shown that LIFU could protect nerve cells against inflammation and&#xD;
      oxidative stress, as well as stimulate neurotrophic factor production. In humans, LIFU has&#xD;
      been reported to be effective in relieving pain caused by carpal tunnel syndrome (Median&#xD;
      nerve compression). Also, several studies have evidenced that cancer patients suffering from&#xD;
      chemotherapy drug-induced peripheral neurogenic pain had significant improvement by LIFU&#xD;
      treatment. Thus, we aim to take advantage of LIFU to treat the painful DPN. We plan to design&#xD;
      a randomized controlled double-blind study. The primary endpoint is the patient's pain score&#xD;
      (NRS), and the secondary endpoints include Neuropathy Symptom Score (NSS) and Neuropathy&#xD;
      Deficit Score (NDS). Through this study, we anticipate establishing a new method for managing&#xD;
      painful DPN.&#xD;
