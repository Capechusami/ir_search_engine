      The project will consist of subjects who have suffered Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and who&#xD;
      are able to ambulate on treadmill with or without a harness system. This will be a 4-week&#xD;
      controlled study consisting of two groups of TBI patients, high-intensity intervention group&#xD;
      and low-intensity control group. Both groups will receive physical therapy treatment 3 times&#xD;
      per week for 1 hour. The intervention group will undergo 30-minute sessions of high-intensity&#xD;
      walking on a treadmill with an overhead harness attached for safety. In addition, they will&#xD;
      also get up to 30-minutes of low-intensity physical therapy in order to receive 1 hour of&#xD;
      treatment time. The control group will undergo only low-intensity physical therapy activities&#xD;
      for 1-hour. Low-intensity physical therapy will include strength exercises, stretches,&#xD;
      balance, and low-intensity gait training. All participants in both groups will complete these&#xD;
      outcome measures on the first day of the study, after 2 weeks of participation, and again at&#xD;
      the end of 4 weeks or on their last day before discharge from Carilion's services. Later on,&#xD;
      all participants in both groups will be followed up to complete the same set of outcome&#xD;
      measures at the end of 1 month since completion of the protocol. This follow up session will&#xD;
      take up to 45 minutes to complete.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gait, mobility and cognitive function will be first assessed using seven standardized&#xD;
      performance-based outcome measures including both mobility and cognitive measures. All&#xD;
      participants in both groups will complete these outcome measures on the first day of the&#xD;
      study, after 2 weeks of participation, again at the end of 4 weeks, or on their last day&#xD;
      before being discharged from Carilion's services, and 1 month after their 4 week completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of the intervention group will undergo physical therapy for 3 days a week for 4&#xD;
      weeks, with each session lasting a total of 60 minutes. They will start with 30 minutes of&#xD;
      high-intensity gait training (HIGT) followed by up to 30 minutes of low-intensity therapy.&#xD;
      For HIGT, participants will be secured safely on a treadmill with or without an overhead&#xD;
      harness and unweighting system for successful gait training. Their resting HR and BP would be&#xD;
      noted. Participants would begin with a warmup for 3 minutes by walking at low speeds with&#xD;
      intensity of 30-50% of heart rate reserve (HRR). HR would be monitored continuously from here&#xD;
      onwards till the conclusion of the protocol. Following the warmup, treadmill walking speed&#xD;
      will be initially set at target HR of 85%HRR that was noted from the treadmill test. If the&#xD;
      participant did not reach 85% HRR during the treadmill test, treadmill speed would be set by&#xD;
      subtracting 0.1 mph (or 0.1 treadmill workload unit) from the speed at which they started&#xD;
      showing gait instability or backward drift during the treadmill test. The goal would be to&#xD;
      have participants walk at high aerobic intensity with target HR between 60-85%HRR, ideally&#xD;
      close to 85%HRR, for 25 minutes. The studies report that the closer the heart rate can be&#xD;
      maintained to the 85% target HR, the more beneficial the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant is unable to achieve at least 60%HRR in the first few minutes of&#xD;
      high-intensity phase, the participant's feeling of physical exertion would also be measured&#xD;
      by asking them about a score on the Rates of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale of 0-10. Here the&#xD;
      goal would be to have them maintain an exertion intensity score of 5-8. If needed,&#xD;
      participants would be allowed to rest by standing or sitting down. The amount of time spent&#xD;
      in high-intensity and rest periods would be recorded. BP will also be recorded at 15-minute&#xD;
      and 25-minute timepoints, or during rest breaks. At conclusion of 25 minutes of HIGT,&#xD;
      participants will cool down for 2 minutes by walking at 30-50% HRR. Their HR and BP will&#xD;
      again be measured at the end of the cool down period. Besides HR and BP, participant's oxygen&#xD;
      saturation would also be monitored during this protocol using a pulse oximeter to assess&#xD;
      blood oxygen levels. Depending on the remaining time and activity tolerance levels,&#xD;
      intervention group participants will then perform up to 30 minutes of low-intensity physical&#xD;
      therapy until they have reached a total of 60 minutes for that session. These may consist of&#xD;
      low-intensity gait activities, exercises (such as lower extremity strength training with or&#xD;
      without weights or electrical stimulation, sit to stands from a chair, mat exercises for&#xD;
      upper/lower extremities and core strength, etc.), stretches, balance, and other therapeutic&#xD;
      activities (such as transfers, bed mobility training, etc.) for functional mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will receive 60-minute sessions of only low-intensity&#xD;
      physical therapy for 3 days a week for 4 weeks. Here, the goal is to have the participants&#xD;
      work at a lower intensity with a target HR below 60%HRR. Low-intensity physical therapy could&#xD;
      include low-intensity gait activities, exercises (such as lower extremity strength training&#xD;
      with or without weights or electrical stimulation, sit to stands from a chair, mat exercises&#xD;
      for upper/lower extremities and core strength, etc.), stretches, balance, and other&#xD;
      therapeutic activities (such as transfers, bed mobility training, etc.). During these&#xD;
      sessions, HR and BP would be measured and noted at regular intervals to monitor and note the&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory intensity of those activities.&#xD;
