  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially its management and associated costs, remains a major&#xD;
      concern globally. There is a direct correlation between circulating levels of low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and the incidence of CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess bempedoic acid/FDC in a real-world clinical setting in adult patients&#xD;
      in Spain with hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study will be conducted in order to further understand the potential&#xD;
      risks and benefits of bempedoic acid/fixed dose combination (FDC) with ezetimibe in a&#xD;
      real-world clinical setting in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia&#xD;
      (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia and to gain insight into the&#xD;
      effectiveness (managing plasma levels of LDL-C) as well as safety (clinical events associated&#xD;
      with the treatment modalities). No study medication will be provided as part of this protocol&#xD;
      to the patients. Medications will be as prescribed by the treating physician in line with&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
