  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug&#xD;
      combination (trastuzumab deruxtecan and durvalumab) to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor-2 (HER2)-expressing inflammatory breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trastuzumab deruxtecan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Durvalumab&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 open label study of neoadjuvant trastuzumab deruxtecan plus durvalumab for&#xD;
      patients with stage III, HER2-positive or HER2-low inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), who have&#xD;
      not received prior therapy for ipsilateral breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled into one of two study treatment groups: HER2 positive IBC&#xD;
      (Cohort 1) or HER2 low IBC (Cohort 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research procedures including screening for eligibility, clinic visits for treatment, tumor&#xD;
      biopsies, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Durvalamab or Trastuzumab&#xD;
      deruxtecan for inflammatory breast cancer, but both have been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study is expected to last about 22 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 63 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmaceutical company, AstraZeneca, is supporting this research study by providing the&#xD;
      study drugs and funding.&#xD;
