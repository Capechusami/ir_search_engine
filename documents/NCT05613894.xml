  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase 1b dose-escalation study of cabozantinib in combination with&#xD;
      177Lu-PSMA-617 in subjects with mCRPC. The primary hypothesis is that cabozantinib with&#xD;
      177Lu-PSMA will be safe and have efficacy in patients with mCRPC. The dose-escalation phase&#xD;
      (Part 1) will assess the rate of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the DLT evaluation&#xD;
      period and identify the MTD and/or recommended dose and schedule for the subsequent expansion&#xD;
      phase (Part 2).&#xD;
