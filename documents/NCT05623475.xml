  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a disturbance in consciousness with reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift&#xD;
      attention that occurs over a short period of time and tends to fluctuate over the course of&#xD;
      the day. 50% to 81.7% had delirium during their ICU hospitalization. Delirium is associated&#xD;
      with increased physical restraint, ventilation use, length of ICU stay, and mortality.&#xD;
      However, there is no established delirium care pathway in target hospital. Chen et al. (2014)&#xD;
      demonstrated that structured assessment stations with immediate feedback may improve overall&#xD;
      learning efficiency over an EBP workshop alone. However, no published delirium care education&#xD;
      study has used OSCEs as an intervention for healthcare professionals. The aim is to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of implementing a Scenario- based education intervention, including objective&#xD;
      structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) on delirium care among healthcare professionals.&#xD;
      This is a knowledge translation research, builds on eight years of delirium care research in&#xD;
      University of Wollongong, Australia. The research will be undertaken at ICUs in a medical&#xD;
      center in northern of Taiwan. There are two phases: (1) systematic review to identify&#xD;
      delirium screen tool, and (2) a randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine the&#xD;
      effects of implementing a Scenario-based education intervention, including OSCE (experimental&#xD;
      group), and on-line education only (control group) focused on recognition and management of&#xD;
      delirium. The hypothesis is: Scenario-based education intervention, including OSCE can&#xD;
      increase the competence and self-efficacy among healthcare professionals in delirium care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OSCEs are an integral aspect of all levels of medical education but limited to undergraduate&#xD;
      nursing and allied health education. OSCEs are rarely used in the workplace as learning&#xD;
      activities with nursing and allied health clinicians. This is the reason why this education&#xD;
      initiative was innovative. OSCEs are simulated 'real life' clinical scenarios presented to&#xD;
      clinicians who are required to demonstrate to an assessor the clinical tasks which form an&#xD;
      OSCE scenario.&#xD;
