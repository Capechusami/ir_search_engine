      This phase 2b, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study will evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of HTD1801, 1250 mg twice daily (BID) compared to placebo BID on histologic&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This phase 2b, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study will evaluate the effect of HTD1801 on histologic improvements in adult subjects with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or pre-diabetes. Approximately 210 subjects with biopsy-confirmed NASH and evidence of stage 2 or stage 3 liver fibrosis will be randomized 2:1 to receive HTD1801 1250 mg twice daily (BID) or placebo BID. Subjects will receive investigational product for up to 60 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A decrease of ≥2-points in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) with ≥1-point decrease of either lobular inflammation or ballooning and no worsening of fibrosis; OR Resolution of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (defined as the overall histopathologic interpretation of 1) &quot;no fatty liver disease&quot; or 2) &quot;fatty liver disease (simple or isolated steatosis) without steatohepatitis AND a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) of 0 for ballooning and 0-1 for inflammation and no worsening of fibrosis.&#xD;
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) is a histological scoring system that assesses a liver biopsy and gives scores for steatosis (0-3), lobular inflammation (0-3), and hepatocyte ballooning (0-2). The higher the score the more severe the disease. The total range for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score (NAS) is between 0 to 8. The lower the score the better the outcome.</description>
