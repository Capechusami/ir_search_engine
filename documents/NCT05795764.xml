    <description>CRP is a brief psychotherapeutic intervention that can be provided to patients at risk of suicidal behavior. When using the intervention, a provider works with the patient (1) to conduct a narrative assessment of the events preceding suicidal thoughts or behavior, and (2) to develop a personalized plan for identifying and managing distress that could escalate to a suicide attempt. The CRP, which is typically handwritten by the patient on an index card, includes personal warning signs of distress, emotion regulation strategies, reasons for living, and contact information for friends/family as well as professional (psychological/medical) and emergency resources.</description>

    <description>Existing clinical practices in the emergency department include the following elements recommended by the VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines: (1) all patients are screened for suicidal ideation at every visit; (2) for those with positive screens, a suicide risk assessment interview is conducted by a mental health professional; (3) a safety planning form with means restriction (such as the Stanley-Brown; Stanley &amp; Brown, 2012) is completed; and (4) patients are referred for follow-up mental health treatment as needed. Other elements of TAU could include behavioral and psychotropic interventions, referrals to specialty mental healthcare, and admission for psychiatric inpatient care.</description>

    <ipd_description>This study is one of five studies part of a consortium, referred to as ASPIS. All de-identified demographic and clinical data collected as part of the ASPIS projects will be available as raw individual-level data for sharing with external researchers working at an institution with a Federalwide Assurance (FWA) for the Protection of Human Subjects. ASPIS data will therefore be available for secondary analytic purposes. Names and institutions of persons either given or denied access to data will be tracked by our Administrative Core and will be available upon request from the sponsor. ASPIS data will not be available for data sharing until after all ASPIS projects are complete and the primary outcomes for each project are published.</ipd_description>
