  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was a retrospective, non-interventional patient chart review and used a panel of&#xD;
      oncologists/hematologists from the US to collect real-world clinical outcomes of patients&#xD;
      with CML-CP in 3L+ and those with the T315I mutation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study included two distinct cohorts of CML-CP patients; that is, patients with CML-CP&#xD;
      who initiated 3L for CML-CP (i.e., 3L cohort) and patients with CML-CP with T315I mutation&#xD;
      (i.e., T315I cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design for the analyses of the 3L cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The index date: date of initiation of 3L therapy for CML-CP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study period: period of ≥ 24 months following the index date unless the patient died&#xD;
           before&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient characteristics were measured at CML diagnosis and at the index date&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical outcomes of interest were measured during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design for the analyses of the T315I cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The index date: date of initiation of a line of therapy identified as the T315I line of&#xD;
           interest (i.e., identification of T315I mutation before initiation or over the course of&#xD;
           line of therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study period: period of ≥ 24 months following the index date unless the patient died&#xD;
           before&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient characteristics were measured at CML diagnosis and at the index date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical outcomes of interest were measured during the study period&#xD;

&#xD;
        Physician selection&#xD;
&#xD;
        Physicians were eligible to participate in the study if they fulfilled all of the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Completed medical subspecialty training&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reported hematology, medical oncology, or any other oncology subspecialties as the&#xD;
             primary medical subspecialty&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Were responsible for treatment decisions and follow-up for ≥ 1 adult patient with Ph+&#xD;
             CML-CP who received a 3L or those with the T315I mutation since January 2013 (the date&#xD;
             from which molecular monitoring response on the International Scale (IS) became a more&#xD;
             standard procedure/commonly available&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had access to molecular monitoring results reported on the IS, and with a sensitivity&#xD;
             level of precision for molecular response of MR3 (BCR ABL1/ABL1 ≤ 0.1% or 3-log&#xD;
             reduction) or better&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient selection Participating physicians were directed to provide information on patients&#xD;
        who were included into the following separate cohorts. Each participating physician&#xD;
        contributed up to 5 patient medical charts from each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the 3L cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients diagnosed with Ph+ CML-CP who initiated a 1L therapy, switched to a 2L&#xD;
             therapy, and initiated a 3L therapy for CML-CP&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All lines of therapy (TKIs or other CML treatments) received outside of an&#xD;
             interventional clinical trial setting&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3L therapy was initiated on or after January 1st, 2013 (when molecular monitoring&#xD;
             became a common practice in CML monitoring) and no later than November 30th, 2018, to&#xD;
             have a minimum of 2 years of follow-up after therapy initiation, except if the patient&#xD;
             died before&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the T315I cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients diagnosed with Ph+ CML-CP who initiated ≥ 1 line of therapy for Ph+&#xD;
             CML-CP and T315I mutation was identified&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All lines of therapy (TKIs or other CML treatments) received outside of an&#xD;
             interventional clinical trial setting&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Line of therapy identified as the T315I line of interest was initiated on or after&#xD;
             January 1st, 2013, and no later than November 30th, 2018, to have a minimum of 2 years&#xD;
             of follow-up after therapy initiation, except if the patient died before&#xD;
&#xD;
        For both cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Ph+ CML-CP for whom the physician had complete information on the CML&#xD;
             related care from CML diagnosis and for ≥ 2 years after the initiation of line of&#xD;
             therapy of interest (i.e., 3L or line of therapy identified as the T315I line of&#xD;
             interest), unless the patient died before. Complete information included: CML&#xD;
             treatments, treatment duration, routine laboratory (e.g., complete blood count (CBC),&#xD;
             BCR-ABL), CML status (e.g., SOKAL risk score, CP/accelerated phase (AP)/ blast crisis&#xD;
             (BC)), medications, and clinical status (e.g., history, physical exam)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The physician had access to molecular monitoring results reported on the IS from&#xD;
             initiation of the line of therapy of interest and with a sensitivity level of&#xD;
             precision for molecular response of MR3 (BCR-ABL1/ABL1≤0.1% or 3-log reduction) or&#xD;
             better Of note, the cohorts were not mutually exclusive such that patients included in&#xD;
             the 3L cohort with T315I mutation was included in the T315I cohort. Thereafter, there&#xD;
             was an oversampling of patients with T315I mutation. Patients from the T315I cohort&#xD;
             from the oversampling with a 3L were not included in the 3L cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Physicians and patients who did not meet study inclusion criteria detailed above were&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
