  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Public Health Nurses (PHN) received training to deliver a day-long Cognitive Behavioural&#xD;
      Therapy (CBT)-based workshop for treating postpartum depression (PPD). Participants in the&#xD;
      study are randomly assigned to the treatment group (1-day CBT workshop) or control group&#xD;
      (usual postnatal care). Data will be collected from all participants at baseline, 3 and 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will aim to determine if online day-long CBT-based workshops delivered by public&#xD;
      health nurses can be added to treatment as usual to improve postpartum depression more than&#xD;
      treatment as usual alone, iif the workshops are cost-effective, and if the workshops can&#xD;
      stably improve depression, its common comorbidities and reduce adverse effects on the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Online 1-Day CBT-Based Workshops delivered by PHNs will be an effective (and&#xD;
      cost-effective) way to stably improve PPD, its comorbidities, and reduce its adverse effects&#xD;
      on the family.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression (PPD) is one of the most common complications of childbirth, affecting&#xD;
      1 in 5 mothers. Left untreated, it increases the risk of future depressive episodes and can&#xD;
      have profound effects on offspring. A single case of PPD has been estimated to cost as much&#xD;
      as $150,000 over the lifespan, or $3 billion for each annual cohort of Canadian births.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current clinical practice guidelines recommend evidence-based psychotherapies (e.g.,&#xD;
      cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)) as 1st-line treatments for the vast majority of mothers&#xD;
      with PPD. The key role that psychotherapy plays in the treatment of PPD is further emphasized&#xD;
      by the US Preventive Services Task Force which recommends universal PPD screening, but &quot;only&#xD;
      when CBT or other evidence-based counseling is available.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      While treating PPD can reduce its adverse effects, safe, timely, accessible interventions are&#xD;
      essential to optimizing outcomes. However, only treatments that can be upscaled can have an&#xD;
      impact on PPD at the population level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The delivery of psychotherapy in large groups (up to 30 participants) is a relatively new&#xD;
      phenomenon, but may be capable of addressing mothers' needs, as well as treating PPD on the&#xD;
      scale required to address its prevalence. Brief (i.e., 1-Day) interventions contain the core&#xD;
      content of more comprehensive, evidence-based interventions, but their brevity makes them&#xD;
      easier to disseminate beyond traditional treatment settings (e.g., in public health). 1-Day&#xD;
      CBT-Based Workshops have been delivered by trained mental health professionals&#xD;
      (psychologists, psychiatrists) to treat generalized anxiety disorder and depression in&#xD;
      general population samples, and postpartum depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Can Online 1-Day CBT-Based Workshops for PPD delivered by Public Health Nurses&#xD;
      (PHNs) added to treatment as usual (TAU) improve PPD more than TAU alone at 12 weeks&#xD;
      post-treatment? Secondary: Can these workshops improve PPD at 6 months post-treatment and&#xD;
      reduce levels of anxiety, parenting stress, partner relationship discord, improve&#xD;
      parent-infant attachment, and reduce problems with temperament and behaviour in offspring at&#xD;
      3 and 6 months? Tertiary: Are the workshops cost-effective?&#xD;
&#xD;
      A parallel-group Ontario-wide randomized controlled trial (RCT) with experimental (workshop)&#xD;
      and TAU (control) groups will address our objectives. Participants in both groups will&#xD;
      complete all study questionnaires and be compared at baseline, and 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group will receive the Online 1-Day workshop (delivered by 2 PHNs) in&#xD;
      addition to TAU, and the control group will receive TAU alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be mothers who have an infant under 12 months, who are 18 years or older,&#xD;
      who are experiencing elevated symptoms of postpartum depression and who are free of current&#xD;
      bipolar, psychotic and/or substance use disorders.&#xD;

    <measure>Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 12-item scale designed to measure perceived social support from three sources: (1) family, (2) friends and (3) significant other. Items are scored on a 7-point scale, and total scores range from 12-84 with higher scores indicating a higher level of perceived social support. A score of 12-35 indicates low perceived social support, 36-60 indicates medium perceived social support and 61-84 indicates high perceived social support.</description>

    <measure>Parenting Stress Index (PSI-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Parenting Stress Index (short form) is a 36-item parent self-report measure that identifies potentially dysfunctional parent-child systems on three subscales: parental distress, parent-child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child. The measure also produces a total score that is an indication of overall level of stress a person is feeling in their role as a parent. Higher scores indicate higher levels of stress.</description>

    <measure>Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ) is a 25-item maternal-report measure that assesses four aspects of maternal-infant relations: (1) bonding, (2) rejection and anger towards the infant, (3) infant-focused anxiety and (4) incipient abuse. Subscales 1-3 will be explored as a continuous outcome using subscale total score. Each item is scored on a scale of 0-5, with higher scores suggestive of more problems. Mother-infant bonding will be measured as a continuous and dichotomous outcome, using cut-off scores for each subscale indicating bonding disorders. Cutoff values of 12 for the bonding subscale, 17 for rejection and anger, and 10 for infant-focused anxiety have been proposed to define bonding disorders in each category.</description>

The investigators will measure resources consumed from the perspective of public health care payer and corresponding unit costs will be calculated using provincial billing rates.</description>

    <description>The Online Workshop is a day-long intervention delivered by two trained public health nurses consisting of 6 hours of instruction delivered in 4 modules. The 1st contains information on PPD etiology with a focus on modifiable cognitive risk factors (e.g., negative thoughts, maladaptive core beliefs). The 2nd module focuses on cognitive skills including cognitive restructuring. The 3rd builds behavioural skills such as problem solving, behavioural activation, assertiveness, sleep strategies, and using supports. The final module provides an opportunity for goal setting/action planning. Teaching methods include didactic sections, group exercises, and role-plays. Regular breaks are incorporated. Each participant is given a professionally designed manual to facilitate learning. We also provide a list of region-specific PPD resources and a copy of the Canadian Practice Guidelines for the treatment of PPD.</description>
