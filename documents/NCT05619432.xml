  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seniors deal with considerable visual demands (driving, communicating, traveling) and reduced&#xD;
      vision affects their quality of life, ability to enjoy activities, and age-in-place. Vision&#xD;
      loss has a heavy, increasing, economical and social burden. It can also have substantial&#xD;
      impacts on caregivers physically, psychologically, and financially because one tends to miss&#xD;
      more work, be less productive, and thus have fewer job opportunities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registration will describe the clinical portion of a larger study designed to evaluate&#xD;
      both the feasibility and effectiveness of the Re:Garde Program, a Virtual Reality (VR) visual&#xD;
      training program for older adults to help maintain visual perception to promote quality of&#xD;
      life and prolonged independence. In partnership with our care partners the investigators will&#xD;
      implement the Re:Garde Program at an interprofessional clinic and as part of a loaning&#xD;
      program for older adults to use in the home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical portion of this study will look at how effective the Re:Garde program is at&#xD;
      maintaining or improving visual perception, ability to conduct activities of daily living&#xD;
      (e.g. read, drive, cook, exercise etc.), general wellness, and quality of life. The&#xD;
      feasibility of implementing this program in the two settings will be evaluated separately as&#xD;
      part of the full protocol.&#xD;

      This will be an interventional, pragmatic, pilot study with a target total recruitment of 30&#xD;
      participants (15 per arm). The study duration is 7 weeks. Participants will be assigned to&#xD;
      one of two arms: Clinic Setting vs Home Setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING &amp; BASELINE TEST&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial visit in the clinic, participants will be screened for exclusion criteria and&#xD;
      practice a condensed version of the immersive VR (IVR) stimulation using the head-mounted&#xD;
      display (HMD). Following stimulation participants will be assessed for IVR sensitivity, or&#xD;
      cybersickness, using the Virtual-Reality Induced Symptoms and Effects (VRISE) questionnaire.&#xD;
      Finally participants will be asked to complete vision tests within the VR headset (for visual&#xD;
      attention and cognition) and a series of questionnaires corresponding to visual perception,&#xD;
      ability to perform activities of daily living, and quality of life. Participants in the&#xD;
      home-arm will take home an HMD along with a package of questionnaires for the duration of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of the study will perform their visual training on the HMD every other day for&#xD;
      six weeks (21 sessions total). The clinic-arm participants will train at the clinic using the&#xD;
      HMD provided. The home-arm participants will train using the HMD on loan to them for the&#xD;
      duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each training session (to be completed every other day) will contain three blocks of 15&#xD;
      audiovisual stimulation tasks. Each task lasts for 20 seconds of audiovisual IVR stimulation&#xD;
      (3D-Multi Object Tracking + correlated sound). There will be a 2-min break between each of&#xD;
      the three blocks of tasks. After each session, the participant will answer the VRISE&#xD;
      questionnaire through the HMD. Data from the IVR stimulation and the VRISE score will be sent&#xD;
      automatically through Wi-Fi in real-time to a dedicated and secured laboratory computer&#xD;
      located at Krembil Research Institute after each session. The total time for the training&#xD;
      session should be approximately 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the mid-point of intervention (end of week 3) participants will repeat the visual tests&#xD;
      and questionnaires from baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST-INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participants complete their 6-week intervention program they will repeat the visual&#xD;
      tests and questionnaires from baseline along with a new questionnaire to evaluate the quality&#xD;
      of the VR software in terms of user experience. Subjects participating in the loaning program&#xD;
      will schedule a home visit where the VR equipment and questionnaires will be collected at&#xD;
      this point. All participants will also be interviewed to collect feedback on their experience&#xD;
      with the device, feasibility of the therapy, and overall experience.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Initial Visit (Day 1), Mid-point (end of Week 3), Treatment completion (Week 7)</time_frame>
    <description>This 19-item questionnaire will ask participants about a series of daily activities that some individuals with visual problems find challenging to perform. These activities are categorized into five subscales (distance vision, near vision, glare disability, night driving, and daytime driving). Each subscale is scored between 0 (inability to perform the activity because of visual difficulty) and 100 (no visual difficulty).</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>HMD: Immersive VR</intervention_name>
    <description>The device application involves the 3D multiple-object-tracking (3D-MOT) paradigm composed of 8 high-contrast spheres which are adapted to the visual ability of participant (luminosity and size). The initial speed of the spheres is adjustable and determined during the inclusion visit.&#xD;
STIMULATION:&#xD;
One or more of the spheres is temporarily cued (target). Then all spheres move for 20 seconds following random linear paths, bouncing on one another and on the walls of a virtual 3D cube when collisions occur. After 20 seconds, the movement stops and the participant is asked to select, using a laser pointer, the initially cued target(s) among the eight spheres. If the selection is correct the speed of the spheres in the next trial is increased. If the selection is incorrect the speed of the spheres in the next trial is decreased.&#xD;
Based on performance, stimulations will be adjusted to change difficulty level (e.g. changing backgrounds, number of cued balls, etc.)</description>
