    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, one-arm study, which is aiming to evaluate the feasibility of combination&#xD;
      of Disitamab Vedotin, Sintilimab and S-1 as conversion therapy in patients with HER2&#xD;
      overexpression unresectable gastric cancer .&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, 30 HER2 overexpression unresectable gastric cancer patients will enrolle and&#xD;
      treate with Disitamab Vedotin, Sintilimab and S-1. During the study period, imaging&#xD;
      examinations were conducted every 6-12 weeks to evaluate the tumor and whether it reached the&#xD;
      operable standard. The scheme and duration of postoperative adjuvant treatment were&#xD;
      determined by the investigator according to the patient's conditions (Sintilimab was&#xD;
      recommended to be maintained for 1 year, and other drugs were increased or decreased&#xD;
      according to the patient's conditions). During the study, safety evaluation and effectiveness&#xD;
      evaluation will be conducted.&#xD;
