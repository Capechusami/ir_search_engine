      Aims: (1) Investigate the efficacy of PelviSense-assisted PFMT compared with PFMT alone for&#xD;
      improving SUI symptom severity in women; (2) Compare the cost-effectiveness of the PelviSense&#xD;
      device against PFMT alone for treating SUI in women; (3) Explore the views of women regarding&#xD;
      the use of the PelviSense device as an adjunct to PFMT and the impacts of the PelviSense&#xD;
      device on their lives and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and subjects: A sequential, embedded, experimental mixed-methods design, including a&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) and semi-structured focus groups, will be conducted&#xD;
      alongside an economic evaluation. The proposed study will include 142 women with SUI or&#xD;
      stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Women will be randomly allocated to one of two groups (PelviSense or PFMT&#xD;
      alone [control]). The PelviSense group will perform PFMT with assistance from the PelviSense&#xD;
      device, and the control group will perform PFMT without biofeedback (i.e., PFMT alone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form,&#xD;
      one-hour pad test, Modified Oxford Scale, EQ-5D-5L, and electronic cost diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and expected results: Statistical analysis will be conducted using analysis of&#xD;
      covariance. The PelviSense group is expected to report significant improvements in primary&#xD;
      and secondary outcomes compared with the PFMT alone group. The PelviSense group will yield&#xD;
      cost savings and result in lower health care utility compared with the PFMT alone group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training (PFMT) is a common conservative first-line&#xD;
      treatment for SUI in women. However, the success of PFMT alone, without adjunctive therapies,&#xD;
      has been hampered by the lack of training adherence among patients, who report the inability&#xD;
      to contract the correct PFMs and limited motivation to perform PFMT exercises. Therefore,&#xD;
      PFMT is often combined with adjunctive therapies, such as electromyography (EMG) biofeedback&#xD;
      via an intravaginal probe (referred to as conventional biofeedback), transvaginal electrical&#xD;
      stimulation (TVES), or weighted vaginal cones. However, PFMT adjunctive therapies that&#xD;
      involve intravaginal probes/ cones are not preferred by women because they are invasive, and&#xD;
      the vaginal insertion of probes/ cones can cause pain and discomfort. In addition, older&#xD;
      women with atrophic vaginas have difficulty retaining probe/cones within the vaginal canal&#xD;
      due to weak PFM tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To meet the existing need for a non-invasive PFMT adjunctive therapy, the research team&#xD;
      developed the PelviSense. The PelviSense is an innovative, non-invasive biofeedback device&#xD;
      with wearable EMG sensors, designed to assist individuals in isolating and strengthening PFMs&#xD;
      by helping them distinguish correct PFM contractions (lifting or squeezing the muscles) from&#xD;
      incorrect attempts (bearing down). A mixed-methods study, including a full-scale RCT and&#xD;
      semi-structured focus groups, alongside an economic evaluation, will be conducted to evaluate&#xD;
      both the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the newly developed PelviSense device for&#xD;
      the treatment of SUI in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Investigate the efficacy of PelviSense-assisted PFMT compared with PFMT alone for&#xD;
      improving SUI symptom severity in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Compare the cost-effectiveness of the PelviSense device against PFMT alone for&#xD;
      treating SUI in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Explore the views of women regarding the use of the PelviSense device as an adjunct to&#xD;
      PFMT and the impacts of the PelviSense device on their lives and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Recruitment: Women with SUI who attend the outpatient Obstetrics and Gynecology&#xD;
      Department of Kwong Wah Hospital (KWH) will be recruited for the study. In addition,&#xD;
      potential participants will be recruited using a non-probability convenience sampling&#xD;
      technique through public, KWH, elderly care centers, and HK Polytechnic University (PolyU)&#xD;
      campus advertising. Advertising will consist of study flyers posted at KWH, around the&#xD;
      university campus, in waiting rooms of university health services and physiotherapy clinics,&#xD;
      in community churches, and in university-owned amenities, including sports centres and gyms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and blinding: Computer-generated randomisation will be utilised to ensure that&#xD;
      both study groups are assigned an equal number of participants at a 1:1 ratio. Sequentially&#xD;
      numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes of similar size and shape will be utilised to conceal&#xD;
      group allocation and avoid selection bias. Due to the nature of the intervention, it is not&#xD;
      possible to blind the therapists or participants to the allocation of treatment; therefore,&#xD;
      only the outcome assessor will be blinded. To minimise detection bias, the outcome assessors&#xD;
      will not participate in the treatment, and all study outcomes will be assessed in a separate&#xD;
      room without any knowledge of participant allocation. Statistical analysis will be performed&#xD;
      in a blinded manner, with each group assigned a code (group A and group B). The group&#xD;
      identities will be revealed after all analyses are completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure and baseline assessment: Potentially eligible women who contact research personnel&#xD;
      will be invited to attend an in-person screening session. On this first day of contact, all&#xD;
      women will undergo BMI measurement; complete the screening questionnaire, MMSE, and 1-h pad&#xD;
      test to confirm eligibility; and provide written informed consent. Baseline assessments of&#xD;
      study outcomes will be performed, and eligible and consenting participants will be randomised&#xD;
      to intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Outcomes assessments will be completed at baseline (time point 1 [T1]),&#xD;
      1-month (T2) and 6-months (T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. The interventions will be provided for 6 months, beginning with a 1-month&#xD;
      supervised training period at KWH and PolyU. Following supervised training, women will be&#xD;
      instructed to perform unsupervised home exercises for 5 months. Unsupervised home exercises&#xD;
      will consist of at least eight contractions, performed 3 times per day, for 5 days of each&#xD;
      week, with or without the biofeedback device according to group assignment. Each contraction&#xD;
      will last for 10 seconds, followed by relaxation for 10 seconds. The PFMT exercise parameters&#xD;
      are based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence PFMT guidelines for UI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative study (semi-structured focus groups). A computer-generated randomization schedule&#xD;
      will be utilized to identify 20 participants (from the 71 participants included in the&#xD;
      PelviSense-assisted PFMT group) to participate in the focus groups. Each focus group will&#xD;
      last for 45-60 minutes. Focus groups will continue to be conducted until data saturation&#xD;
      occurs. Focus groups will be scheduled for 8-months post-randomisation. A semi-structured&#xD;
      focus group approach will be used, during which discussion will be guided by but not limited&#xD;
      to a set of pre-determined, open-ended questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing and analysis: Statistical analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat&#xD;
      basis using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (v.25; Armonk, NY).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment effects for both primary and secondary outcomes between T1, T2, and T3 and across&#xD;
      the intervention groups will be evaluated using a two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)&#xD;
      with age as the covariate. T1 and T2 will be compared to establish immediate treatment&#xD;
      effects, and T1 and T3 will be compared to evaluate the retention of treatment effects. For&#xD;
      significant group by time interaction effects, post-hoc analysis using Bonferroni correction&#xD;
      will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unadjusted mean total and disaggregated costs and differences in costs between the&#xD;
      PelviSense and PFMT alone groups will be calculated. Seemingly unrelated regression (SUR)&#xD;
      analyses will be used to estimate total cost differences (ΔC) and effect differences (ΔE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EQ-5D-5L responses will be converted into utility scores to estimate the gain or loss of&#xD;
      quality-adjusted life-years (QUALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be&#xD;
      calculated using the formula ICER = ΔC / ΔE. Uncertainty surrounding ICERs and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals for cost differences will be estimated using bias-corrected and accelerated&#xD;
      bootstrapping with 5,000 replications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data from the focus groups will be analysed using the six phases of thematic&#xD;
      analysis recommended by Braun and Clarke. The identified themes will then be defined and&#xD;
      named according to their contents. The final set of themes will be confirmed as coherent and&#xD;
      comprehensive by review of the team.&#xD;
