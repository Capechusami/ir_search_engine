      The current proposal is designed as a first-in-human Phase 1 open-label, dose-escalation&#xD;
      study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and the maximum tolerated dose of DHM among&#xD;
      healthy volunteers using a purified form of DHM from a local cGMP compliant source (Master&#xD;
      Herbs, Inc).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dihydromyricetin (DHM), a bioactive flavonoid from an edible plant (ampelopsis&#xD;
      grossedentata), is reported to have multiple protective effects against chemical-induced&#xD;
      liver injuries. For example, the antioxidant activity and cellular metabolic protective&#xD;
      effects of DHM may act via the AMP kinase (AMPK) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide&#xD;
      (NAD+)-dependent Sirtuin (Sirt)-1 energy regulating pathway. Furthermore, there is&#xD;
      accumulating evidence supporting the use of DHM for the treatment of alcohol use disorder and&#xD;
      the possible reduction/prevention of alcohol-associated liver disease in animal models. DHM&#xD;
      may represent a novel approach to counteract alcohol-induced liver damage and promote alcohol&#xD;
      metabolism via changes in hepatocellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial biogenesis driven by&#xD;
      the AMPK/Sirt-1/PGC-1Î± axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These preclinical data suggest the potential of DHM as a novel therapeutic agent in&#xD;
      alcohol-related diseases. However, further study in humans is warranted. While DHM has been&#xD;
      used for herbal tea in traditional Chinese medicine for hundreds of years, and there has been&#xD;
      a small clinical trial using DHM in China among individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver&#xD;
      disease, there have been no controlled human studies published that have assessed the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, or optimal dosing of DHM in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DHM is marketed as a dietary supplement in the United States and is not regulated by the Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) as a drug. Because the FDA has little control over the quality&#xD;
      of herbal products such as DHM, it is necessary to quantitatively estimate the potentially&#xD;
      active ingredients and the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile with oral administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current proposal is designed as a first-in-human Phase 1 open-label, dose-escalation&#xD;
      study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and the maximum tolerated dose of DHM among&#xD;
      healthy volunteers using a purified form of DHM from a local cGMP compliant source (Master&#xD;
      Herbs, Inc).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single-center dose-escalation study. A total of 12 participants are planned and will be divided into 4 cohorts with 3 participants per cohort. Cohort 1 will consist of three healthy volunteers who will receive DHM in two doses of 300 mg. Cohort 2 will consist of three healthy volunteers who will receive DHM in two doses of 900 mg. Cohort 3 will consist of three healthy volunteers who will receive DHM in two 50mL PO solution doses of 300 mg plus 140mg L-lysine. Cohort 4 will consist of three healthy volunteers who will receive DHM in two 50mL PO solution doses of 900 mg plus 420mg L-lysine. Each participant will be administered the study drug during a 24-hour period. Evaluations will be taken at uniform intervals.</intervention_model_description>
