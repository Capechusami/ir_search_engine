      The goal of this observational survey study is to evaluate the current practice variations of&#xD;
      preoperative multidisciplinary team meetings (MDT meetings) for high risk noncardiac surgical&#xD;
      patients. The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the current variation in Dutch hospitals in the practice of preoperative MDT&#xD;
           meetings for high risk noncardiac surgical patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which facilitators and barriers influence the implementation process of preoperative MDT&#xD;
           meetings? Participants are anesthesiologists in Dutch hospitals who will be asked to&#xD;
           fill in a one-time survey. One anesthesiologist per anesthesiology department will be&#xD;
           asked to fill in the survey. The survey will take approximately 5 to 10 minutes to&#xD;
           complete.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of patients with multiple comorbidities is significantly growing. Medical advances&#xD;
      have made it possible to perform challenging surgical interventions to increase life&#xD;
      expectancy. Yet, it is this group of patients that has a high risk of complications after a&#xD;
      surgical intervention leading to a reduction in their quality of life and&#xD;
      self-sustainability. Current European and Dutch guidelines recommend the implementation of&#xD;
      preoperative multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings for high risk noncardiac surgical&#xD;
      patients. However, the evidence underlying the guideline recommendations is scarce.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the implementation process of a well-functioning MDT meeting can be a challenge&#xD;
      and may sometimes lead to no MDT meeting at all. And finally, the guidelines do not specify&#xD;
      conditions by who or how the MDT meeting should be done, for example required attending&#xD;
      specialties or specific subjects to be discussed. A broad practice variation in preoperative&#xD;
      MDT meetings might thus be present and could be a complicating factor in the equal treatment&#xD;
      of patients compliant to 'best practice'. The current survey will evaluate practice variation&#xD;
      of preoperative MDT meetings for high risk noncardiac surgical patients in the Netherlands&#xD;
      and assess possible facilitators and barriers in the implementation process.&#xD;
