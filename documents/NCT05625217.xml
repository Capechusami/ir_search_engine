  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research study is to understand how 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a&#xD;
      radioactive sugar behaves in head and neck cancer (HNC) and inflammation immediately&#xD;
      following injection and at many hours post-injection, with the world's first total-body&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scanner (EXPLORER).&#xD;

    <description>All participants are asked to complete two study scan visits. First visit occurs before treatment and the second visit occurs 12 +/- 2 weeks after treatment. Each visit will involve a single injection of FDG, followed by three PET/CT scans that will start immediately following injection, at about 2 hours post-injection and at 5 hours post-injection, respectively and last about 60 minutes, 20 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Stage II-IVa (American Joint Committee on Cancer, 8th edition) OC who are planned for&#xD;
             RT (≥60 Gy) as per routine clinical standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient must be ≥18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Willing and able to lay motionless in a supine position for up to 60 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient must be able to provide study specific informed consent prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol&#xD;
             requirements (including prolonged fasting).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior RT for any malignancy leading to overlap with planned RT fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior chemotherapy for any malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects suffering from severe claustrophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who have had a research study involving radiation within one year of&#xD;
             enrolling in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects who are pregnant (subjects 18 to 60 years old who are able to become pregnant&#xD;
             unless documented hysterectomy or bilateral ovarian removal is available will be&#xD;
             tested prior to injection of imaging agent - positive test will exclude from&#xD;
             participating in the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who are breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prisoners.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any significant medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator would&#xD;
             prevent the subject from participating and/or adhering to study related procedures or&#xD;
             interfere with subject safety (e.g., poorly controlled diabetes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Children (&lt;18 years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Body weight more than 240 kg (529 pounds)&#xD;
