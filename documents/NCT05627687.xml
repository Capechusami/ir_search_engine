  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine a heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVB) intervention versus a&#xD;
      music listening control (MLC) for 30 family caregivers (FCGs) of Alzheimer's disease (AD)&#xD;
      (and related dementias: ADRD) patients to examine feasibility (acceptability/adherence,&#xD;
      satisfaction) and direction of change in caregiver burden, stress, resilience, anxiety,&#xD;
      self-compassion, and relationship quality over the course of 8-weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to examine feasibility of implementing a HRVB intervention and an MLC&#xD;
      control with AD FCGs. The HRVB and MLC interventions will be evaluated for acceptability&#xD;
      (operationalized as adherence to intervention) and satisfaction and to identify necessary&#xD;
      intervention modifications. Feasibility benchmarks: 85% of participants will be at least 70%&#xD;
      adherent to implementation goals (10-min use 5-7 days per week). Feasibility of randomization&#xD;
      will be examined by comparing adherence/retention (expecting similar patterns across&#xD;
      interventions). Acceptability/satisfaction with HRVB and MLC will be evaluated in&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews post-intervention including detailed probing on feature&#xD;
      preferences, barriers/facilitators, suggested improvements for retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim of this study is to examine patterns of association of HRVB and MLC with&#xD;
      outcomes. The investigators will examine pre- to post-intervention changes (and sustained&#xD;
      outcomes at follow-up) in self-reported caregiver burden, stress and resilience. Change in&#xD;
      relationship quality will additionally be assessed from pre- to post intervention. Change in&#xD;
      ANS balance, a neurophysiological indicator of reduced emotional distress and improved&#xD;
      resilience, will be assessed using HRV data at all four timepoints to examine trends and&#xD;
      change over time. Significance tests will not be conducted, in alignment with goals for pilot&#xD;
      feasibility studies. The investigators will observe the direction of change and outcomes to&#xD;
      examine the value of MLC as an appropriate control condition showing minimal placebo effects&#xD;
      compared to HRVB.&#xD;

    <description>Music listening control (MLC) will consist of listening to selected music tracks of choice using either the Pandora or Spotify app (with coaching to download app and play, and log listening time in diary), specifically choosing a neutral channel, Coffeehouse Playlist. For both interventions, FCG will be asked to practice/listen 10-minutes at a time with their AD patient (sharing as much or as little as is possible/preferred) for at least 4-5 days/week, and asked to complete diary/checklists to show times practicing/listening.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive coaching in a practice that is guided using an Inner Balance app with a device that senses pulse and provides feedback to help achieve a rhythm of heart rate variability called resonant frequency, or &quot;coherence&quot;. They will be guided first in slowed heart-focused breathing and positively-focused emotions and then will connect to the app to receives visual feedback to achieve a favorable HRV.</description>
