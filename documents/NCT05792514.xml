      -  assess the subjective global validity and reliability of using The Pediatric Yorkhil&#xD;
           Malnutrition Score (PYMs) and merits of using the Screening Tool for Risk on Nutritional&#xD;
           status and Growth (STRONGkids) as a nutrition screening tool&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  correlate it with the severity of their nutritional derangements in comparison to the&#xD;
           Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Pediatrics (STAMP)in hospitalized&#xD;
           Egyptian children aged (2-5)years in Assiut University Children Hospital (AUCH).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is responsible for around 3.1 million child deaths annually in low and middle&#xD;
      income countries,the malnutrition is involved in about 45% of under-five children deaths in&#xD;
      numerous developing countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malnutrition is associated with negative outcomes for inpatients, including increased risks&#xD;
      of infections , increased muscle loss , impaired wound healing, longer hospital stay and&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malnutrition may be responsible for delayed recovery and need for intensive nursing care,&#xD;
      thus increasing the cost of hospitalization .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional support for inpatients has made progress and it is provided systematically&#xD;
      through multidisciplinary nutritional support teams (NSTs) in most hospitals. The first step&#xD;
      to run and manage the NST effectively and efficiently in each hospital may be proper&#xD;
      screening and selection of the patients who are at risk of malnutrition requiring nutritional&#xD;
      support during hospitalization Routine nutritional screening is rarely carried out in&#xD;
      pediatric patients because of the lack of a simple and properly validated nutritional&#xD;
      screening tool. The current practice of identifying children at risk of malnutrition is&#xD;
      reliant on interpretation of anthropometric data and clinical judgement; the reliability of&#xD;
      which is dependent on nutritional knowledge of pediatricians .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe cases of malnutrition are easily recognized; however, the identification of children&#xD;
      with lesser degrees of malnutrition or at risk of malnutrition, which is also important, is&#xD;
      not as easily achieved.&#xD;
