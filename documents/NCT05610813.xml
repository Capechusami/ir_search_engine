      Randomized, open-label, parallel-group phase III trial to prove an additional benefit of the&#xD;
      full-spectrum cannabis extract VER-01 over opioids in patients with chronic non-specific low&#xD;
      back pain for whom drug treatment is indicated and previous optimized treatments with&#xD;
      non-opioid analgesics have not led to sufficient pain relief or were unsuitable due to&#xD;
      contraindications or intolerance.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Patients with indicated drug treatment* where previous optimized treatments** with&#xD;
