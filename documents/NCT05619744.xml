      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary anti-tumor activity of RO7616789. The study will have 3&#xD;
      parts: Dose Escalation (Parts 1 and 2) and Dose Expansion (Part 3). Participants with&#xD;
      advanced stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study.&#xD;
