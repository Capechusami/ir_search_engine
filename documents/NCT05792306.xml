  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether the reduction of the sense of discomfort and&#xD;
      redness and swelling of the skin surrounding the wound of patients by use of the novel&#xD;
      electrolyzed water spray will relieve the inflammation of the skin.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study, water inculding tap water,pure water and salt water, and an apparatus for&#xD;
      producing electrolyzed water (https://www.deposon.com.cn; https://www.deposon.com）were used&#xD;
      to generate an electrolyzed water mist spray or spray. This instantly generated electrolyzed&#xD;
      water mist spray or spray has oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) ≥1200mv,and contains&#xD;
      non-specific total oxidation capacity which equals to 0.28±0.10ppm,0.06±0.04ppm and&#xD;
      3.92±0.39ppm of desolved ozone. This instantly generated electrolyzed water mist spray or&#xD;
      spray does not release detectable ≥0.1mg/m3 of gaseous ozone. This instantly generated&#xD;
      electrolyzed water mist spray or spray has pH 8.4±0.4 and releases negative air ion.The&#xD;
      apparatus for producing electrolyzed water has a positive electrode which is covered by a&#xD;
      conductive diamond material (Patent# CN215308550U). In this study, this novel electrolyzed&#xD;
      water device and the water spray are used to treat wounds created by skin laser surgery.&#xD;

    <measure>A skin signs scale made by modifying the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS).</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The skin signs scale evaluations the signs of skin wound inflammation including redness and swelling of the skin immediately surrounding the wound. This score is based on descriptions of the redness and swelling of the skin surrounding the wound that patients rate 0-10 to assess the condition of their skin. A higher score means a worse outcome. 0 means &quot;no redness and swelling of the skin surrounding the wound &quot; and 10 means &quot;the most redness and swelling surrounding the wound&quot;.</description>
