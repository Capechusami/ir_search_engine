  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) enables assessment of regional lung ventilation at the&#xD;
      bedside. EIT has been safely used in newborn infants to image intrathoracic lung volume&#xD;
      patterns as early as from the first minute of life. This prospective single-centre&#xD;
      observational study is to identify optimal PEEP in infants on respiratory support by&#xD;
      measurements of EIT, FOT and SOPI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence-based guidelines on the optimal level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in&#xD;
      newborn infants on respiratory support do not exist. Furthermore, there is a lack of simple&#xD;
      bed-side parameters to guide clinicians towards the optimal PEEP level. Nevertheless, PEEP&#xD;
      requires individual adjustment to minimize ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), shorten the&#xD;
      duration of mechanical ventilation and reduce respiratory long-term morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential techniques to assess optimal PEEP level in infants on respiratory support include&#xD;
      electrical impedance tomography (EIT), the forced oscillation technique (FOT) and the&#xD;
      saturation oxygenation pressure index (SOPI). EIT is a promising non-invasive technique that&#xD;
      provides information on regional changes in lung aeration and ventilation inhomogeneity. FOT&#xD;
      is used in mechanically ventilated or spontaneously breathing infants and provides&#xD;
      information on reactance (Xrs) and resistance (Rrs) of the respiratory system. SOPI is a&#xD;
      score calculated from the PEEP level, the amount of administered oxygen (FiO2) and the&#xD;
      infant's peripheral oxyhaemoglobin saturation (SpO2). SOPI provides information on the&#xD;
      ventilation to perfusion ratio dependent on the PEEP level. EIT, FOT and SOPI seem promising&#xD;
      tools for identification of optimal PEEP in newborn infants on respiratory support. In&#xD;
      particular, a combination of information on regional ventilation (by EIT), global lung&#xD;
      mechanics (by FOT) and ventilation to perfusion ratio (by SOPI) will improve the&#xD;
      understanding of optimal PEEP and may reduce long-term respiratory sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective single-centre observational study is to identify optimal PEEP in infants on&#xD;
      respiratory support by measurements of EIT, FOT and SOPI. Measurements are performed once&#xD;
      daily during the first three days on respiratory support and are repeated in weekly intervals&#xD;
      if the infant remains mechanically ventilated. An additional measurement is planned after&#xD;
      extubation.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Electrical impedance tomography (EIT)</intervention_name>
    <description>EIT is the measurement of impedance changes of the lung against the flow of alternating electrical currents applied to the thorax. The signal of the electrodes is transmitted to a monitor, which enables real-time assessment of lung aeration and changes in lung volume. EIT is able to reconstruct impedance changes with a high temporal resolution and allows calculation of tidal volumes, relative stretch of lung tissue and areas of poor ventilation. Areas with impedance changes of &lt; 10 % of the maximum impedance changes are called 'Silent Spaces'.</description>

    <intervention_name>Forced oscillation technique (FOT)</intervention_name>
    <description>FOT enables non-invasive assessment of lung mechanics using sound waves to inform about the respiratory impedance of the respiratory system (Zrs). Reactance of the respiratory system (Xrs) as part of Zrs is a surrogate measure of compliance of the respiratory system. Xrs was previously used to identify optimal PEEP level, i.e., the PEEP at highest compliance equivalent, in newborn infants using a setup requiring research-specific hardware and software. The FOT module integrated in the commercially available neonatal ventilator is routinely used. FOT measurements are performed twice at each PEEP level to assess the reproducibility of the measurements.</description>
