  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II trial of neoadjuvant and adjuvant atezolizumab with or without tiragolumab&#xD;
      in conjunction with chemoradiotherapy for unresectable stage III NSCLC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II design provides a fairly rapid way to determine which of two&#xD;
      potential neoadjuvant immunotherapy regimens holds the most promise for evaluation in a&#xD;
      subsequent phase III trial against standard of care adjuvant immunotherapy. The AFT-16 trial&#xD;
      of neoadjuvant atezolizumab in this setting provided proof of concept for safety of the&#xD;
      neoadjuvant approach and for outcomes that compare favorably with standard of care therapy.&#xD;
      The field of lung cancer immunotherapy is evolving rapidly and since the start of AFT-16 not&#xD;
      only has adjuvant immunotherapy with durvalumab become standard of care, but combination&#xD;
      immunotherapy with tiragolumab and atezolizumab for NSCLC has received breakthrough therapy&#xD;
      designation. Safety of combination immunotherapy and radiation has been established in&#xD;
      several trials, but the safety and efficacy of dual immunotherapy is not yet known. In a&#xD;
      group of patients who can be but often are not cured with current therapies, establishment of&#xD;
      a strategy that could increase cure rate is urgent. This randomized phase II trial can be&#xD;
      advocated to determine the best of the two arms for further study with slightly inflated type&#xD;
      I error rate&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective is to determine the relative efficacy of atezolizumab with or without tiragolumab based on progression-free survival (PFS) and select a promising treatment out of the two experimental regiments for further investigation in a future phase III trial compared with standard of care treatment. Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. Participants alive without disease progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation.</description>

&#xD;
         18. Non-pregnant and non-nursing. The effect of atezolizumab and tiragolumab on the fetus&#xD;
             is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception, and agreement to refrain from donating&#xD;
             eggs, as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women must remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;
                  contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment&#xD;
                  period and for 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab, 5 months after the&#xD;
                  final dose of atezolizumab, and 6 months after the final dose of paclitaxel,&#xD;
                  pemetrexed, gemcitabine, carboplatin or cisplatin. Women must refrain from&#xD;
                  donating eggs during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal,&#xD;
                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (â‰¥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with&#xD;
                  no identified cause other than menopause), and is not permanently infertile due&#xD;
                  to surgery (i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes, and/or uterus) or another&#xD;
                  cause as determined by the investigator (e.g., MÃ¼llerian agenesis). The&#xD;
                  definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local&#xD;
                  guidelines or regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include&#xD;
                  bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that&#xD;
                  inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper&#xD;
                  intrauterine devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.&#xD;
                  If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate&#xD;
                  methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will&#xD;
                  be described in the local Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be willing to use 2 methods of birth&#xD;
                  control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the&#xD;
                  course of the study through 6 months after the last dose of study medication.&#xD;
                  Patients of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically&#xD;
                  sterilized or have not been free of menses &gt; 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women who would like to become pregnant after study treatment discontinuation should&#xD;
             seek advice on oocyte cryopreservation prior to initiation of study treatment because&#xD;
             of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to treatment with carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;
             a condom, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  With a female partner of childbearing potential, men who are not surgically&#xD;
                  sterile must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive&#xD;
                  method that together result in a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the&#xD;
                  treatment period, for 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab, and for 6&#xD;
                  months after the final dose of paclitaxel and/or carboplatin. Men must refrain&#xD;
                  from donating sperm during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  With a pregnant female partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during&#xD;
                  the treatment period for 90 days after the final dose of tiragolumab, and for 6&#xD;
                  months after the final dose of paclitaxel or carboplatin to avoid exposing the&#xD;
                  embryo.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.&#xD;
                  If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate&#xD;
                  methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will&#xD;
                  be described in the local Informed Consent Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male patients must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with&#xD;
                  the first dose of study therapy through 6 months after the last dose of study&#xD;
                  therapy Men who would like to father a child after study treatment initiation&#xD;
                  should be advised regarding the conservation of sperm prior to treatment because&#xD;
                  of the possibility of irreversible infertility resulting from chemotherapies used&#xD;
                  in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Patients are capable of giving informed consent and/or have an acceptable surrogate&#xD;
             capable of giving consent on the subject's behalf.&#xD;
&#xD;
