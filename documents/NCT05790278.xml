  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, there is no empirical data that specifies the likely prevalence of purpose in&#xD;
      life disruption among various clinical populations. Between one-third and one-half of cancer&#xD;
      survivors report some degree of existential distress during or after their treatment, but&#xD;
      these findings are not specific to the domain of purpose in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the aforementioned gap, we propose to conduct a survey study to determine the&#xD;
      prevalence of purpose disruption in two clinical populations and determine if the prevalence&#xD;
      of purpose disruption in these populations is different from that of a normative population.&#xD;
