    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of a dietary intervention that includes the&#xD;
      consumption of a novel functional yogurt (enriched with probiotics and polyphenols) on the&#xD;
      blood biomarkers of healthy participants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After having been informed about the study and the potential risks, all participants giving&#xD;
      written informed consent will undergo screening to determine eligibility for study entry&#xD;
      (inclusion criteria). At baseline (t0), a fasting blood sample will be taken by venipuncture&#xD;
      from the participants, and they will be randomly assigned in a double-blind manner&#xD;
      (investigator and participant) to one of the intervention groups, i.e. meal including the&#xD;
      consumption of the functional yogurt (yogurt enriched with probiotics and polyphenols) or&#xD;
      consumption of yogurt enriched with probiotics or consumption of placebo yogurt. The&#xD;
      participants have to finish their meals within 15 minutes (t1) and after the meal, blood&#xD;
      sampling will be repeated for the times, t2 = 30 min, t3 = 90 min, t4 = 180min. After a&#xD;
      washout period of 7 days, the participants will consume the functional yogurt, or the yogurt&#xD;
      enriched with probiotics, or the placebo yogurt, in a cross-over design, and the blood&#xD;
      sampling will be carried out as described above. Finally, after a washout period of 7 days,&#xD;
      the participants will consume the functional yogurt, or the yogurt enriched with probiotics&#xD;
      or the placebo yogurt in a cross-over design, and the blood sampling will be carried out as&#xD;
      described above. Throughout the interventional period participants' dietary intake,&#xD;
      anthropometrical data, medical history, and dietary habits will be monitored.&#xD;
