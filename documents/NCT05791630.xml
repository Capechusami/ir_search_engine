    <textblock>
      Appropriate and timely care during birth is critical to the survival and health of women and&#xD;
      their babies. In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) presented the Labour Care Guide&#xD;
      (LCG) as the new recommended tool for monitoring birth and assessing progression, replacing&#xD;
      the WHO partograph. This evidence-based guide was designed to ensure improved quality and&#xD;
      safety of care, and to avoid unnecessary interventions during birth. The LCG was developed to&#xD;
      be used in all settings globally, but it has only been tested in health facilities in South&#xD;
      America, Asia and Africa, while it has not been tested in high-income settings. Implementing&#xD;
      a new guideline for monitoring birth is a comprehensive operation that will affect both the&#xD;
      national economy, health systems, and individual patients; therefore, further research on the&#xD;
      possible advantages is needed before national enrolment. Hence, the trial proposed in this&#xD;
      application is crucial to form the required foundation of knowledge. The trial will be&#xD;
      conducted in labour wards at ten hospitals, covering all health regions in Norway, and the&#xD;
      established Norwegian Research Network for Clinical Studies in Obstetrics (NORBIRTH), with&#xD;
      dedicated local principal investigators, will provide a robust research environment. This&#xD;
      trial will test the effect of the LCG. Results from this trial will provide knowledge needed&#xD;
      to determine a future implementation of the LCG in Norway.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large robust trial investigating the effect of the LCG is needed to establish a foundation&#xD;
      of knowledge on which the decision of implementing the LCG on a national level should be&#xD;
      based. The Norwegian WHO LCG trial addresses the WHO research priority question: &quot;What is the&#xD;
      effect of the LCG on processes of care, health, well-being and outcomes during labour and&#xD;
      childbirth?&quot;. The trial will have a special focus on intrapartum caesarean section rates and&#xD;
      experience of labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the trial is to test the LCG in an unbiased population in a Norwegian&#xD;
      setting. The project will conduct a nationwide randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the&#xD;
      effect on labour interventions and maternal and neonatal outcomes compared to the previous&#xD;
      WHO partograph. The Norwegian WHO LCG trial will be conducted through three work packages:&#xD;
      WP1 consists of a feasibility study to develop an electronic version of the LCG, and will&#xD;
      test its validity and usability prior to the planned RCT. WP2 consists of a stepped wedge RCT&#xD;
      to assess the effect of the LCG on labour interventions and maternal and neonatal outcomes.&#xD;
      WP3 consists of a survey to investigate patient reported outcome through the childbirth&#xD;
      experience questionnaire (CEQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a stepped wedge multicenter cluster randomised non-inferiority trial, to be conducted&#xD;
      within the nationwide NORBIRTH network for clinical obstetric research. The hospitals will&#xD;
      act as clusters and the women as individual participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial period all hospitals will use the WHO partograph and the LCG according to&#xD;
      the trial protocol for all women with a planned vaginal delivery, these women constitute the&#xD;
      trial population. Women who want to opt out will not be included in the analyses. Each&#xD;
      hospital has established local research groups which are dedicated to implement the project.&#xD;
      The included hospitals will consent to adhere to the protocol in the trial period and state&#xD;
      that they have the capacity to participate both logistically and practically. Local&#xD;
      coordinators will be appointed with the responsibility of monitoring the trial and secure a&#xD;
      thorough documentation according to the protocol.&#xD;
