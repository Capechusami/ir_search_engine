  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with limb loss receiving inpatient rehabilitation are at greater risk for depression&#xD;
      and anxiety, social isolation, and generally have poorer quality of life. To proactively&#xD;
      address the mental health needs of this population, St. John's Rehab recruited two&#xD;
      psychiatrists to provide mental health support to their inpatient population groups. Because&#xD;
      there are limits to mental health resources and because group therapy facilitates patients&#xD;
      learning from each other, the investigators plan to test an innovative psychological group&#xD;
      therapy program designed for limb loss inpatients to address mental health challenges, and to&#xD;
      better prepare them to integrate back into the community. Our designed psychosocial group&#xD;
      therapy is led by a psychiatrist and an occupational therapist who create a structured&#xD;
      process for inpatients to discuss their challenges and identify coping strategies that will&#xD;
      help them transition back into the community. The investigators will recruit 100 inpatients&#xD;
      with limb loss, with 50 taking part in a weekly psychosocial group therapy program and 50&#xD;
      receiving treatment as usual. The investigators will evaluate if anxiety and depression&#xD;
      significantly decreases in our treatment group compared to those who received treatment as&#xD;
      usual. The findings of this work will provide needed evidence for the clinical feasibility&#xD;
      and utility of a rehabilitation inpatient group therapy program, which can serve as a useful&#xD;
      model for other limb loss sites across Canada.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a pragmatic trial with a weekly supportive-expressive group&#xD;
      therapy (SEGT) intervention for inpatients with limb loss, at a free-standing rehabilitation&#xD;
      hospital in Toronto, Canada. This is pragmatic research trial that has stemmed from our&#xD;
      feasibility trial involving therapy SEGT for dysvascular lower extremity amputation (LEA)&#xD;
      inpatients. Pragmatic trials stand in contrast to randomized controlled trials (RCT's), which&#xD;
      instead examine causal relationships and are characterized by rigorous designs, featuring&#xD;
      randomization, blinding and allocation concealment, to eliminate bias. Despite yielding&#xD;
      results with high internal validity and statistical credibility, RCT's are not always&#xD;
      generalizable to real life practice. Perhaps to address this, pragmatic trials are growing in&#xD;
      popularity. Pragmatic trials aim to test interventions in routine clinical settings &quot;to&#xD;
      maximize applicability and generalizability&quot; as well as to determine whether an intervention&#xD;
      works under &quot;real life&quot; conditions. As a complement to our previous feasibility trial, the&#xD;
      goal of this work is to understand the effectiveness of SEGT upon mental health outcomes&#xD;
      among individuals with limb loss. Hence, the objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      pragmatic trial using a SEGT intervention for addressing anxiety and depression for&#xD;
      inpatients with limb loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This two-arm pragmatic trial will evaluate if SEGT leads to better mental health outcomes&#xD;
      (depression and anxiety) for inpatients with limb loss compared to those patients who receive&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over a 2 year period, 100 inpatients will be recruited for this trial, with 50 being assigned&#xD;
      to the SEGT arm and 50 to a TAU condition who receive standard care only (which may include&#xD;
      an individual psychiatric consultation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed intervention is based on the evidence-based supportive-expressive (SEGT)&#xD;
      approach and was designed by an interprofessional team from psychiatry, social work,&#xD;
      physiatry and occupational therapy, along with patient advisors. The SEGT approach fosters&#xD;
      mutual support, promotes openness and emotional expression. It has been shown to yield&#xD;
      improvements in anxiety, psychosocial functioning, health literacy, and social support in&#xD;
      breast cancer survivors. This SEGT approach has been modified, in both content and process,&#xD;
      to specifically address the needs of limb loss inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEGT will be delivered and co-facilitated by either a psychiatrist and/or two allied&#xD;
      healthcare professionals supervised by a psychiatrist on a rolling basis for a duration of 1&#xD;
      year or until the intended sample size is achieved. Typically, it is a 6-module program held&#xD;
      over a 3-week period (approximately 1 hour sessions X 2 week) that is framed within social&#xD;
      cognitive theory, whereby resilience to adversity (limb loss in this instance) relies on&#xD;
      personal enablement. Enablement serves to equip the individual with the personal resources to&#xD;
      cultivate their self-efficacy and mastery and to select and construct environments that&#xD;
      promote successful adaption. For the purposes of this trial, SEGT sessions will be offered on&#xD;
      a rolling basis - which means it will be offered once a week, and participants may join the&#xD;
      sessions at any time as the sessions will follow a similar framework over a six-modules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As infection control protocols allow, inpatient participants will participate in a large room&#xD;
      setting at St. John's Rehab seated at least six feet apart and masked, with staff&#xD;
      facilitators. SEGT groups will be capped to having 8 participants per session. If the&#xD;
      pandemic conditions do not enable us to have an in-person group event, the investigatorswill&#xD;
      explore delivering the intervention via Zoom onsite at St. John's Rehab (delivered by&#xD;
      tablets), where patients can log in private rooms across St. John's Rehab to participate. The&#xD;
      six sessions are based on a current inpatient psychosocial group therapy program being&#xD;
      offered to their inpatients, and will be adapted by our investigation team (PI: Dr. Steinberg&#xD;
      - Psychiatrist), and is based on a program being run at West Park Healthcare Centre for their&#xD;
      limb loss patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sessions will involve facilitated discussion by two allied healthcare professionals or&#xD;
      one psychiatrist and an allied healthcare professional, and will focus on guided discussions&#xD;
      on coping with limb loss, managing sequelae associated with limb loss (e.g., pain), goal&#xD;
      setting and strategies for community living. Based on participant interest, the&#xD;
      investigatorsmay also suggest exercises related to mindfulness and relaxation (e.g.,&#xD;
      breathing exercises, etc.). All activities are not physically strenuous and can be done&#xD;
      sitting or standing (depending on participant preference and ability), and combine&#xD;
      information sharing by the group facilitator as well as creating opportunities for group&#xD;
      dialogue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hoped that SEGT will influence coping self-efficacy (a &quot;belief in one's ability to cope&#xD;
      with post-traumatic stress demands, and affects various aspects of human functioning through&#xD;
      four processes: cognitive, motivational, affective and environmental selection.&quot;).&#xD;
      Self-efficacy is a modifiable construct, and is tied to positive outcomes (less pain,&#xD;
      improved quality of life). Hence, in theory, if our patients develop higher levels of coping&#xD;
      self-efficacy, they will be better equipped in preparing themselves for hospital discharge,&#xD;
      will enhance their self-care and ability to correct maladaptive coping, and display improved&#xD;
      resilience and adaption to life after limb loss; thereby optimizing community reintegration&#xD;
      and decreasing illness burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At. St. John's Rehab, all patients may be referred to social work and/or a psychiatrist to&#xD;
      address their mental health needs. As well, members of the interprofessional team provide&#xD;
      psycho-social supports where needed. The types of psycho-social supports provided to patients&#xD;
      in the TAU condition will be documented (e.g., referral to psychiatrist, social worker,&#xD;
      etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All admitted LEA inpatients who fulfill eligibility criteria will be approached within 3 days&#xD;
      of admission and invited to participate in the trial, be given a recruitment flyer by a&#xD;
      member of their circle of care, and those who agree to be approached by our research staff to&#xD;
      learn more will then undergo the informed consent process. The research analyst responsible&#xD;
      for recruitment and informed consent will use electronic patient records (SunnyCare) and&#xD;
      liaise with clinical staff to identify new eligible admissions. The clinicians within the&#xD;
      circle of care will still be the first point of contact to approach patients. The analyst&#xD;
      will only approach once a clinician confirms a patient would like to learn more about the&#xD;
      study. SunnyCare access will only be used by the analyst to determine who is newly admitted,&#xD;
      so they can direct clinicians to approach them promptly, rather than wait for a clinician to&#xD;
      inform them of who has been admitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent has been obtained, participants will be assessed using baseline&#xD;
      measures within the first week of their admission. In addition to the primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes, data on socio-demographics, impairment, and other relevant medical history (e.g.,&#xD;
      past mental health treatments, etc.) will be collected. All participants, will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a battery of surveys prior to starting the intervention, at post-intervention&#xD;
      (ideally 24-72 hours after intervention), and at 3 months post-discharge. The statistician&#xD;
      analyzing the data will be blinded to group allocation. Prior to beginning the SEGT&#xD;
      intervention, participants will be given a document which highlights the guidelines for&#xD;
      participating in the group. Participants will also be provided an information sheet with&#xD;
      available community resources to help with their mental health. Persons in the SEGT arm will&#xD;
      be invited to complete a qualitative interview 3 months post-discharge to explore their&#xD;
      experiences with the group psychosocial intervention and assess coping. If, during the 3&#xD;
      month follow-up, the patient indicates significant psychological distress or is found to be&#xD;
      at increased risk of mental health deterioration, a psychiatrist (not associated with the&#xD;
      study) will follow-up and direct them to appropriate community resources. The Assertive&#xD;
      Suicidality Action Plan (ASAP) will be followed if a participant expresses suicidal ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noted that since this is a pragmatic trial, some group participants may also be&#xD;
      receiving individual psychiatric supports by a member of the psychiatric team. Our analysis&#xD;
      will control for patients who are receiving both individual and group interventions. No&#xD;
      patient will be denied access to psychiatric care should they agree to participate in the&#xD;
      group. The investigators will ensure that patients receiving the group intervention are not&#xD;
      treated by the same practitioner if they receive individual psychiatric care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome data from participants will be collected over the phone/Zoom and may be collected&#xD;
      in-person if feasible. The study team will communicate with the inpatient unit manager to&#xD;
      follow all COVID-19 protocols and other infection control policies. If feasible, data&#xD;
      collection may take place in-person for the baseline and post-intervention assessments. If&#xD;
      there are situations that do not allow for the safe collection of data (e.g., physical&#xD;
      distancing, etc.), then the data can be collected over the phone and a staff member will&#xD;
      arrange for a phone line to be used on the unit in private if the patient does not have&#xD;
      access to one. All patient-reported outcome data post-discharge will be collected by phone or&#xD;
      Zoom. In some instances, the interviewer may complete the interviews while working from home.&#xD;
      When the interviewer works from home, they will connect to a Sunnybrook workstation via&#xD;
      Sunnybrook virtual private network (VPN) and initiate a Zoom meeting. The participant will&#xD;
      call in to the Zoom meeting and speak to the interviewer. The interviewer will record the&#xD;
      meeting and save the recording directly to their network drive. Participants will receive a&#xD;
      $25 gift card for their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block randomization will be used to assign participants to either SEGT or TAU. This type of&#xD;
      randomization is designed to randomize subjects into groups that result in equal sample&#xD;
      sizes. Blocks are small and balanced with predetermined group assignments, which keeps the&#xD;
      numbers of subjects in each group similar at all times. Our team will consult a statistician&#xD;
      to generate the randomization schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the research team who will oversee study operation [Dr. Sander Hitzig -&#xD;
      Co-Investigator] will be responsible for generating the randomization sequence, and will be&#xD;
      blinded to which participants are allocated to which group. A research analyst will be&#xD;
      responsible for collecting the baseline, discharge and 3 month survey data. Since it is&#xD;
      impossible to blind the study participants, The study team will request they not discuss&#xD;
      their group allocation with the coordinator, but it is possible they may inadvertently reveal&#xD;
      this to the coordinator. If the coordinator becomes unblinded then they will make a note and&#xD;
      the coordinator will continue to collect data. However, this has not occurred for our&#xD;
      feasibility trial that preceded the current study, which lowers the likelihood of this&#xD;
      occurring. However, the person analyzing the survey data will be blinded to group allocation&#xD;
      (group 1 versus group 2) only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistician blinded to group allocation will be hired to undertake the analyses. The&#xD;
      analysis will include a descriptive analysis of the main outcome and secondary quantitative&#xD;
      measures. T-tests and repeated measures ANOVA will be used to detect differences on the&#xD;
      outcome measures. The model will include group (SEGT and TAU groups), time (baseline,&#xD;
      discharge and 3-month follow-up) and a group by time interaction term. If the sample sizes&#xD;
      are too small or the data do not meet the assumptions for normality, the non-parametric&#xD;
      equivalents will be applied.&#xD;
