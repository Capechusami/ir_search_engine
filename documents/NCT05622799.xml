  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to learn about how effective a Mind-Body Medicine Training Program&#xD;
      is for prisoners. The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does the training program increase resilience?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does the training program reduce depression, anxiety, and/or stress?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does the training program increase optimism?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does the training program increase prisoners' belief that they can have better coping&#xD;
           skills?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Does the training program increase a sense of meaning in life?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Does the training program increase a sense of life purpose?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend a 2-part mind-body medicine training program (4 days for each part)&#xD;
      and will fill out questionnaires before the training, after the training and 6 months after&#xD;
      the training. They will also participate in group interviews after the training and 6 months&#xD;
      after the training.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline on Resilience using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) after the 8 day training and at 6 month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after the 8 day training, and at 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The CD-RISC is a validated, self-report instrument assessing resilience over the last month. The CD-RISC consists of 25 questions that are rated on a 5-point scale with higher scores representing greater resilience. Change = After the 8 day training score- Baseline score; Follow-up score - After the 8 day training score; and Follow-up Score - Baseline score</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline on Depression, Anxiety, and Stress using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale -21 (DASS-21) after the 8 day training and at 6 month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after the 8 day training, and at 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The DASS-21 is a validated, self-report instrument assessing the emotional states of depression, anxiety ans stress over the past week. The DASS-21 consists of 7 questions each for depression anxiety and stress are rated on a 4-point scale with higher scores representing higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Change = After the 8 day training scores- Baseline scores; Follow-up scores - After the 8 day training scores; and Follow-up scores - Baseline scores</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline on optimism using the Life Orientation Test - Revised (LOT-R) after the 8 day training and at 6 month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after the 8 day training, and 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The LOT-R is a validated, self-report instrument assessing optimism. The LOT-R consists of 10 questions that are rated on a 5-point scale. Four of the questions are &quot;filler questions&quot; and are not calculated in the total score. Higher scores represent greater levels of optimism. Change = After the 8 day training score- Baseline score; Follow-up score - After the 8 day training score; and Follow-up score - Baseline score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline on coping - self efficacy using the Coping Self-Efficacy (CSE) Scale after the 8 day training and 6 month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after the 8 day training, at 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The CSE Scale is a validated, self-report instrument assessing coping self-efficacy. The CSE scale consists of 26 questions that are rated on scale from 0 &quot;cannot do at all&quot; to 10 &quot;certain can do&quot;. Higher scores represent greater levels of coping self-efficacy. Change = After the 8 day training score- Baseline score; Follow-up score - After the 8 day training score; and Follow-up score - Baseline score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline on meaning in life using the Meaning in Life Questionnaire (MLQ) after the 8 day training and 6 month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after the 8 day training, and at 6 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The MLQ is a validated, self-report instrument assessing meaning in life. The MLQ consists of 10 questions that are rated on 7- point scale. There are 2 subscales: presence of meaning and search for meaning. Higher scores represent greater levels of these two components of meaning in life. Change = After the 8 day training score- Baseline score; Follow-up score - After the 8 day training score; and Follow-up score - Baseline score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>How the Mind-Body Medicine Training has Affected the Participants by using Focus Group Interviews</measure>
    <time_frame>After the 8 day training and at 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Two focus group interviews will be conducted with approximately 10 participants each. Focus group questions will cover topics such as practice of the mind-body techniques, how the training has affected the participant in terms of relationships, how they view their future, and how they are going to used what they have learned.</description>
