      Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, balanced randomized, single dose, 2-sequence, 2-period (period 1 and&#xD;
      period 2), 2-treatment crossover (between Treatment A and Treatment B for Part 1), study part&#xD;
      to determine the relative bioavailability of SAR443820 in tablet formulation versus capsule&#xD;
      formulation under fasted conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two treatments are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A: SAR443820 - tablet formulation in fasted condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B: SAR443820 - capsule formulation in fasted condition Each administration&#xD;
           will be a single dose of SAR443820 separated by a wash out of at least 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, balanced randomized, single dose, 2-sequence, 2-period (period 1 and&#xD;
      period 2), 2-treatment crossover (between Treatment C and Treatment D for Part 2) study part&#xD;
      to perform a preliminary assessment of the effect of a high-fat meal on pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      parameters of single dose of SAR443820 in tablet formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two treatments are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment C: SAR443820 - tablet formulation in fasted condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment D: SAR443820 - tablet formulation in fed condition Each administration will be&#xD;
           a single dose of SAR443820 separated by a wash out of at least 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are not allowed to participate in more than one part of the study. In both Parts&#xD;
      1 and 2, the assessment of pharmacokinetic, safety and tolerability are performed at each&#xD;
      treatment period at baseline (prior single dosing) up to 48-hour postdosing in healthy adult&#xD;
      male and female participants.&#xD;

      Screening period: up to 4 weeks (Day -28 to Day -2). In both Part 1 and Part 2: Period 1: Day&#xD;
      -1 to Day 3 and 5 days wash out period. Period 2: Day -1 to Day 3 and until end-of-study&#xD;
