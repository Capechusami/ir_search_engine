  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the effect of the combination treatment of&#xD;
      sitravatinib with tislelizumab in patients with Recurrent/Metastatic Cervical Cancer after&#xD;
      Platinum-Based Chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main question it aims to answer is the percentage of people in the study who have a&#xD;
      partial or complete response to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive treatment under the care of their treating physician and will be&#xD;
      reviewed regularly.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Monoclonal antibodies that target either PD-1, PD-L1, or the other checkpoint inhibitors can&#xD;
      block binding and boost the immune response against cancer cells. However, many early-phase&#xD;
      studies with single immune checkpoint inhibitors did not show enough power to achieve a&#xD;
      promising clinical response, and several trials are evaluating different strategies to&#xD;
      overcome immune tolerance via combination therapies. Combining an immunotherapeutic PD-1&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor with an agent that has both immune modulatory and antitumor properties&#xD;
      could enhance the antitumor efficacy observed with either agent alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sitravatinib is a spectrum selective RTK inhibitor that inhibits several closely related&#xD;
      RTKs, including the TAM family (Tyro3/Axl/MER), VEGFR2, KIT, and MET. Tislelizumab is a&#xD;
      humanised IgG4-variant monoclonal antibody against PD-1. In addition to the antiangiogenesis&#xD;
      activity of sitravatinib, sitravatinib in combination with tislelizumab may elicit greater&#xD;
      anti-tumour activity, as sitravatinib is predicted to enhance several steps in the cancer&#xD;
      immunity cycle that may augment the efficacy of tislelizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, sitravatinib inhibits key molecular and cellular pathways strongly implicated in&#xD;
      carcinogenesis and drug resistance and represents a reasonable strategy to enhance&#xD;
      anti-tumour immunity when combined with tislelizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ITTACc study aims to assess the overall response rate of the combination of tislelizumab&#xD;
      with sitravatinib along with other key outcomes detailed below.&#xD;

             lesions are stable (without evidence of progression for at least 6 weeks on imaging&#xD;
             obtained during the screening period), there is no evidence of new or enlarging brain&#xD;
             metastases, and the patient does not require any immunosuppressive doses of systemic&#xD;
