      Vitamin D deficiency is common among pregnant women, despite daily vitamin D supplements.&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate if maternal vitamin D intake of 90 vs 10 µg affects the&#xD;
      overall health, growth, and immune system of the offspring at birth and after 1 year. Blood&#xD;
      samples at birth and after one year, questionnaires and clinical 1-year examination will be&#xD;
      performed on the children.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is common among Danish pregnant women, although most pregnant women&#xD;
      adhere to guidelines of a daily supplement of 10 µg vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency increases&#xD;
      the risk of complications in the pregnancy e.g., preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      and fetal growth retardation. Several studies indicate that the offspring has an increased&#xD;
      risk of immune diseases e.g., asthma and autoimmune related diseases e.g., multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      if the mother had vitamin D deficiency during the pregnancy. It is well known that vitamin D&#xD;
      affects the immune system, which raises the question of the effects of vitamin D supplements&#xD;
      and which doses to give optimally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate if maternal vitamin D intake of 90 vs 10 µg D3 affects the&#xD;
      overall health, growth, and immune system of the offspring at birth and after 1 year. Blood&#xD;
      samples at birth and after 1 year, questionnaires and clinical 1-year examination will be&#xD;
      performed on the children. The hypothesis is that increased vitamin D supplementation in&#xD;
      pregnancy improves fetal development including the offspring's immune system and the&#xD;
      developing brain. The effects of vitamin D supplementation will strengthen the offspring's&#xD;
      overall health at birth and during their first year of life. Hopefully, this can, in the&#xD;
      future, be part of a guideline to which dose of vitamin D is recommended for Danish pregnant&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
