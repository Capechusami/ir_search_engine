  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigational device used in this clinical investigation, the Nurochek Headset, is a&#xD;
      portable electroencephalogram (EEG) headset which delivers a visual stimulus and measures a&#xD;
      VEP. The visual stimulus is delivered to the subjects' eyes via light-emitting diodes, and&#xD;
      the EEG measures the user's visual-evoked potential. This headset communicates with an&#xD;
      application on a smartphone which processes the signals and transmits them to a secure cloud&#xD;
      server for analysis and storage of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this clinical investigation was to evaluate the performance of the&#xD;
      investigation device (NCII) against clinical diagnosis and SCAT 5, in the accurate detection&#xD;
      of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The primary endpoint outlined for this study was set&#xD;
      at the collection of 100 valid investigational device readings from individuals with&#xD;
      concussion&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to collect data from 100 readings from individuals with concussion.&#xD;
      It was estimate that approximately 10-20% of baselined players would suffer a concussion&#xD;
      during the season. There it was estimated there would be a need to baseline 500-1000&#xD;
      individuals in order to achieve the number of concussions required. The initial assumption&#xD;
      was that sites would provide players pre-season and make players available for testing&#xD;
      post-concussion. In practice, some sites provided player data only post-concussion event&#xD;
      (such as medical clinics). Participants were required from sporting clubs, medical clinicals&#xD;
      and schools.&#xD;
