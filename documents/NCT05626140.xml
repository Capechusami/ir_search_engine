      The goal of this clinical trial is to compare different combinations of diclofenac with&#xD;
      diclofenac monotherapy in acute sciatica. The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the combination of diclofenac plus codeine better than diclofenac monotherapy for&#xD;
           treating severe pain of sciatica&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the combination of diclofenac plus lacosamide better than diclofenac monotherapy&#xD;
           for treating severe pain of sciatica&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to mark their pain intensity on a visual analog scale and fill&#xD;
      oswestry disabilit index questionnaire,treatments they'll be given includes either&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diclofenac monotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diclofenac plus codeine&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diclofenac plus lacosamide&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will compare the above three groups to see if severity of pain and disability&#xD;
      lowered after medication&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal conditions are the most common cause of intense long-term pain, physical&#xD;
      disability and early deaths. They affect hundreds of millions of people of all ages&#xD;
      irrespective of social strata globally. Lumbar radicular pain (LRP), commonly referred to as&#xD;
      &quot;Sciatica&quot; is a relatively common musculoskeletal disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of different drug combinations with&#xD;
      diclofenac for the treatment of acute sciatica. The design of the study is Single-center,&#xD;
      clinical trial with three arms. (Single Blinding). One hundred and twenty patients were&#xD;
      enrolled in this study between September 2021 and July 2022 at the Pharmacology department of&#xD;
      Islamic International Medical College (IIMC) Rawalpindi in collaboration with the&#xD;
      Neurosurgery Department, of Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University (SZABMU) Pakistan&#xD;
      Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) Islamabad. Informed verbal and written consent was taken&#xD;
      from all patients. 40 patients were in the diclofenac (50 mg) plus placebo group, 40 in the&#xD;
      codeine (30 mg) plus diclofenac (50 mg) group and 40 in lacosamide (50 mg) plus diclofenac&#xD;
      (50 mg) group. Patients were followed up at day 5, 10 and 15 to assess change in pain&#xD;
      intensity and functional disability. The use of rescue analgesia was also assessed at the&#xD;
      final day of outcome&#xD;

    <measure>Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients were asked to mark a line and record their pain scores at baseline and day 5, day 10 and day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of leg pain or lower back pain associated with acute sciatica to be assessed using the visual analog scale VAS to determine if the mean pain scores decreased during the course of the medication. VAS is a commonly used pain score in interventinal studies and evaluating pain intensity related with musculoskeletal disorders or post opertive types of pain. For this , the patient is asked to mark a line anywhere on a 10 cm line with 0 taken on the left edge. The mark drawn on the line corresponds to the intensity pf pain experienced by the patient at the time of the pain assessment</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Disbability</measure>
    <time_frame>ODI was measured at baseline and days 5,10, and 15 and patients were asked to fill the questionnaire on the respective days</time_frame>
    <description>The ODI is an index derived from the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire. The self-administered questionnaire consists of ten topics related to intensity of pain, lifting, ability of self-care, potential to walk, capacity to sit, sexual function, strength to stand, social life, quality of sleep, and capability to travel. Each category (topic) is then followed by 6 statements relating different potential scenarios in the patient's life concerning to the topic. Patients are inquired to specify the statement that most strictly is similar to their situation. Statements are linked with scores from 0 to 5, where 0 represents the lowest disability and 5 equivalent to extreme disability. The sum of the ten scores is stated as a percentage of the maximum score (50) ranging from 0% = no disability to 100% = maximum disability</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Use of Rescue Analgesia</measure>
    <time_frame>The use of rescue medication was determined on the final day of outcome i.e. Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>This parameter was evaluated if the patient used rescue medication (YES or NO) in case the pain did not improve or settle with the medicines already given to the patient</description>

    <description>Oral tablet lacosamide is a 3rd generation anti convulsant drug. it is given in a dose of 50 mg 12 hourly for 15 days. It has a longer half life than the other two drugs in comparison and fewer drug interactions as it doesnot interact with the hepatic cytochrome enzymes.hence it is seen to have better pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics than the other drugs in study</description>
