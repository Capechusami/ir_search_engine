  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is an inflammation associated with destruction of the periodontium that&#xD;
      ultimately, if not treated, leads to tooth loss. Clinically, it is characterized by clinical&#xD;
      attachment loss (CAL) and bleeding on probing (BOP) accompanied by increased probing pocket&#xD;
      depth (PPD) and/or gingival recession. The standard periodontitis treatment aims to restore&#xD;
      the homeostasis of the immune system by mechanically reducing the microbial load to levels&#xD;
      that are compatible with stability and health. This is achieved by professional mechanical&#xD;
      biofilm control and motivation of the patient for oral hygiene measures in order to control&#xD;
      the biofilm and avoid disease recurrence. Conventional scaling and root planing (SRP), and&#xD;
      air polishing therapy are tools used for professional biofilm control. More recently,&#xD;
      air-polishing devices have become a promising alternative to conventional SRP in reducing the&#xD;
      clinical time and causing less discomfort and pain for the patients. The objective of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the efficacy of subgingival erythritol air polishing for initial&#xD;
      periodontal pocket healing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis results from a polymicrobial dysbiosis with keystone pathogens affecting the&#xD;
      virulence of the entire biofilm community. Thus, the inability of the host immune system to&#xD;
      eliminate the biofilm insult leads to a complex chronic response with the destruction of bone&#xD;
      and periodontal ligament attachment. The main goal of periodontal therapy is to arrest&#xD;
      further attachment loss and, consequently, prevent further disease progression and subsequent&#xD;
      tooth loss. In most cases, this goal can be predictably achieved by means of non-surgical&#xD;
      periodontal therapy using hand, ultrasonic instruments and air polishing devices. Treatment&#xD;
      with scaling and root planing often results in an additional increase of root&#xD;
      hypersensitivity, thus impairing the patient's quality of life. Minimally invasive&#xD;
      periodontal therapy primarily focus on calculus removal and effective removal of the biofilm&#xD;
      rather than on excessive and intentional removal of root cementum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Air polishing with erythritol powder seems more effective than manual instrumentation at&#xD;
      disrupting biofilm in both shallow and deep pockets, whilst it is more gentle on the root&#xD;
      surface and soft tissues, and allowing proper attachment of periodontal ligament fibroblasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erythritol powder air-polishing with ultrasonic debridement has reported to need less time&#xD;
      than ultrasonic debridement with polishing during periodontal therapy.Therefore, this study&#xD;
      will evaluate the impact of erythritol air polishing in resolving periodontal pockets.&#xD;
