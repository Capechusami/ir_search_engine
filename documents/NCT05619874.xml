  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that by 2030 one in five women and one in seven men will be obese, equivalent&#xD;
      to more than 1 billion people around the world. It should be noted that the largest number of&#xD;
      people with obesity live in countries with low and moderate-income. In 2019, more than 160&#xD;
      million years of healthy life were lost in the world, due to a high body mass index (BMI),&#xD;
      this represents more than 20% of all years of healthy life lost due to chronic diseases.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is essential to stop the increase in obesity and reduce it at all ages, which&#xD;
      demands comprehensive actions at the global level. Scientific evidence suggests that people&#xD;
      with a normal BMI, but with abdominal obesity, have a higher mortality risk compared to those&#xD;
      with a similar or even higher BMI. In addition, visceral adiposity has been associated with&#xD;
      worse survival and with colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several methods of physical exercise have been used to counteract the adverse effects of&#xD;
      obesity, including high-intensity functional circuit training (HIFCT). Scientific evidence&#xD;
      indicates that HIFCT reduces fat mass, body mass, BMI, and waist circumference and improves&#xD;
      muscle strength, maximal oxygen uptake, and health-related quality of life in overweight,&#xD;
      obese, inactive, and with other diseases. However, no research assessed intra-abdominal fat&#xD;
      (IAF), which, more than subcutaneous fat, is associated with cardiovascular risk factors. In&#xD;
      addition, these studies had important methodological limitations. Therefore, the primary&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to identify the effect of two HIFCT protocols, prolonged load&#xD;
      (HIFCT-P) and short load (HIFCT-S), performed in a virtual environment for ten weeks on&#xD;
      intra-abdominal fat in people between 18-40 years-old with abdominal obesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial with parallel arms (HIFCT-P and HIFCT-C) based on a&#xD;
      non-inferiority hypothesis comparing two proportions. Each participant will carry out 30&#xD;
      sessions, three times a week, in a virtual environment. General, concentrated, and block&#xD;
      circuits will be used, with the same exercises, but with different load distribution and&#xD;
      different order between them. Both HIFCT-P and HIFCT-S will carry out six initial adaptation&#xD;
      sessions through a general circuit composed of 12 exercises. Different muscle groups will be&#xD;
      alternated. The exercises will be performed at speeds between 35 and 55 beats per minute&#xD;
      (bpm), to ensure intensities between 50% - 60% in sessions 1 to 3, and between 70% - 80% in&#xD;
      sessions 4 to 6. The Modified Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale (RPE) will be used to&#xD;
      control intensities. From session seven to session 30, HIFCT-P and HIFCT-S will perform the&#xD;
      same exercises but with a different load distribution.&#xD;

    <description>Body Composition Analyzer Seca mBCA 515. The measurement results allow estimating intra-abdominal fat in liters. Values &lt;27 L are considered normal, &gt;27 L to &lt;43 L are considered elevated, and ≥43 L are considered high. Individuals will be instructed to wear light clothing, and stand barefoot on the device, following manufacturer protocols.All assessments will take place at the same time of day.</description>

    <description>For sessions 7 to 14, a concentrated circuit divided into four blocks of three exercises will be carried out, with a duration of 40 seconds per exercise with no rest between them. A rest of 120 seconds will be given at the end of each block, and a rest of the same time at the end of the first set. Two sets will be executed, which will result in a total time of 30 minutes including rest. For sessions 15 to 30, four blocks of two exercises will be performed, with a duration of 60 seconds per exercise, with no rest between them. The rest between blocks will be 120 seconds. Two sets will be performed, for a total time of 30 minutes including breaks. The exercises will be performed at speeds between 35 and 75 bpm. The intensity will be between 80% - 90% (8-9 RPE).</description>
