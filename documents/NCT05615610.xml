  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper limb impairment is present in more than 85% of people with stroke, which greatly affect&#xD;
      the quality of life, social participation, and performance of daily activities of people with&#xD;
      stroke. Previous study also revealed that 53.4% of people after stroke experienced cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. Different cognitive domains might be affected following stroke, such as&#xD;
      attention, memory, language, and orientation, and the problems with memory are often&#xD;
      prominent. Yet, there is no effective treatment for the post-stroke cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) applied on thoracic region and&#xD;
      transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) are simple and non-invasive treatment to&#xD;
      improve upper limb motor function and cognitive function. However, no existing studies have&#xD;
      explored on the effects of TENS and tVNS on cognitive function in people with stroke.&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of TENS on improving&#xD;
      upper limb function and cognitive function in people with chronic stroke. Also, this study&#xD;
      will investigate the cortical response of people with stroke during TENS by using EEG power&#xD;
      spectrum analysis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effects of three intervention protocols in people with&#xD;
      stroke. The participants in Group A will receive TENS on C6 and T5 level of the spine with&#xD;
      upper limb exercises. The participants in Group B will receive tVNS on the cymba conchae of&#xD;
      left outer ear with upper limb exercises. The participants in Group C will receive placebo&#xD;
      tVNS with upper limb exercises.&#xD;

    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment of the Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) assesses the motor control, which included the reflex, synergistic and isolated movements and coordination of the upper extremity. It is a 3-point ordinal scale with 33 items and the total score ranges from 0 to 66. In this scale, &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;cannot perform&quot;, &quot;1&quot; represents &quot;performs partially&quot; and &quot;2&quot; represents &quot;performs fully&quot;. The higher score indicates better motor control of the upper extremity. The FMA-UE has an excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.98) in people with stroke.</description>

    <description>The Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test - Third edition (RBMT-3) examines the everyday memory function with 14 subtests, including the assessment for visual, verbal, recall, recognition, immediate, and delayed memory. The scaled score of each subtest and total scaled score will be computed by converting raw scores based on different age group. Higher scaled score indicates better memory function. The RBMT-3 has demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.997) and intra-rater reliability (ICC = 0.924) and good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.643 - 0.832) in people with dementia, mild cognitive impairment and healthy older adults.</description>

    <description>The Digit Span Test (DST) consists of two parts to measure the verbal short-term memory and working memory of an individual, which are digit span forwards and digit span backwards. The participants are presented with a series of numbers. In the digit span forward (DSF), they are required to repeat the numbers in forward order. In the digit span backward (DSB), they are asked to repeat the numbers in reverse order. The length of digits in each string increases from 3 to 9 in DSF and from 2 to 8 in DSB. Two trials are presented at each length. The test is interrupted when participant failed to either trial at equal digit length. If the participants correctly recall the sequence in either first and second trial, 1 point will be scored. The total score of DSF and DSB are 16 and 14 respectively. The intra-rater reliability of DSF and DSB are 0.891 and 0.598 respectively in older adults with neurocognitive disorder.</description>

    <description>The 23-item Oxford Participation and Activities Questionnaire (Ox-PAQ) evaluates participation and activity levels based on the three domains of routine activities, social engagement, and emotional well-being. Each item is measured on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never; 1 = rarely; 2 = sometimes; 3 = often; 4 = always). The higher scores represent greater difficulties with participation and activities. Good to excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.81 - 0.96) and test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.83 - 0.96) have been shown for this instrument in people with motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease.</description>

    <description>The 12-item Short-Form Survey (second version) (SF-12v2) will be used to measure the health-related quality of life of individuals. This instrument contains eight domains: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. The total score ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating better quality of life.

    <description>The Arm Activity Measure (ArmA) is a 20-item questionnaire to assess the difficulties in passive and active upper limb tasks, where section A evaluates the passive function and section B evaluates the active function. It uses a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (no difficulty) to 4 (unable to do the task). The total score of section A and B are 32 and 52 respectively [59]. The higher score in ArmA indicates more difficulties experienced in activities when using upper limb. Good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.85 - 0.96) has been shown in people with upper limb paresis.</description>
