  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe asthma is now widely accepted to be a heterogeneous syndrome consisting of multiple&#xD;
      phenotypes identified by specific biomarkers and targeted by tailored biological therapies.&#xD;
      However, much remains unclear regarding the best approaches to manage these patients, or&#xD;
      concerning the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small airway (SA) are defined as those airways with an internal diameter &lt;2 mm. In patients&#xD;
      affected by asthma, it has been reported that SA are the predominant site of airflow&#xD;
      resistance. Peripheral airways are thickened in asthma due to chronic inflammation in the&#xD;
      epithelium, submucosa and muscle area. It has been suggested that the outer wall is more&#xD;
      inflamed than the inner wall, with a higher number of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and&#xD;
      neutrophils associated to an increased expression of interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-5&#xD;
      (IL-5) and eotaxin. Moreover, it is well documented that SA inflammation and dysfunction&#xD;
      contribute significantly to the clinical impact of asthma and that 50-60% of asthmatics have&#xD;
      a SA involvement across all disease severities. An important question is whether SA disease&#xD;
      in asthma is variable among distinct asthma phenotypes and whether it occurs in all patients.&#xD;
      Cluster analyses have been recently used to identify specific asthma phenotypes, but markers&#xD;
      of SA function have not been investigated. However, evidence is accumulating to support that&#xD;
      SA dysfunction and inflammation may contribute to distinct asthma phenotypes. Recent findings&#xD;
      indicate that SA are significantly affected in severe asthma and that their involvement is&#xD;
      associated with worse disease outcomes. It has been reported that patients with asthma and a&#xD;
      history of frequent exacerbations per year had a significant SA involvement. Furthermore,&#xD;
      peripheral airways significantly contribute not only to the level of asthma control, but also&#xD;
      to patients' quality of life and perception of symptoms. At last more thickened SA and higher&#xD;
      numbers of eosinophils are detectable in subjects with fatal asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of SA represents a big challenge and requires qualified expertise and&#xD;
      sophisticated techniques including body plethysmography, single and multiple breath nitrogen&#xD;
      washout, impulse oscillometry (IOS), fraction exhaled NO at multiflow, sputum induction and&#xD;
      high-resolution chest CT (HRCT). Such procedures can either provide functional information on&#xD;
      the degree/extent of ventilation heterogeneity and air trapping or facilitate the&#xD;
      understanding of the inflammatory and remodeling processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a number of clinical trials have in recent years demonstrated the efficacy of&#xD;
      biologics in severe asthma. Omalizumab, a humanized anti-Imunoglobulin E monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      (mAb) has been well recognized as an important option for treating allergic asthma as an add-&#xD;
      on therapy for uncontrolled disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three anti-IL-5 therapies are currently available for the treatment of severe asthma,&#xD;
      including Mepolizumab, Reslizumab, and Benralizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The newest biologic agent to be approved is Dupilumab that is a human mAb that targets the&#xD;
      subunit of the IL-4 receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biologics represent an innovative strategy for the treatment of severe asthma. In most&#xD;
      patients with SAD these drugs control inflammation, improve lung function, ameliorate&#xD;
      clinical symptoms, reduce exacerbations and have a marked steroid-sparing effect. However,&#xD;
      there is still a significant proportion of non-responders and a lack of validated predictive&#xD;
      biomarkers in such subpopulation. In regard to this, very limited findings are available&#xD;
      about the effect of biologics therapy on SA.&#xD;

      Study hypothesis We hypothesize that biological therapy has a significant beneficial effect&#xD;
      on small airways disease in severe asthmatics and that the evaluation of small airways before&#xD;
      and during treatment may represent a distinctive marker of response and a novel target for a&#xD;
      preferential use of one over other biological therapies currently available for severe&#xD;
      asthmatic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate small airway endpoints in severe asthmatics before starting biologic&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate longitudinal changes of these endpoints at different time points during&#xD;
           biologic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To relate small airway endpoints recorded at baseline and their changes over time to&#xD;
           other functional, laboratory, clinical and patient-reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To make comparisons for subgroups identified on the basis of the type of the biological&#xD;
           drug used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study center&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the Asthma Center of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario&#xD;
      Agostino Gemelli. Asthma Clinic evaluates approximately 1000 asthmatic patients per year;&#xD;
      furthermore, it is part of the Italian Severe Asthma Network (SANI) and one of the&#xD;
      coordinating centers for the newborn Italian Mild-Moderate Asthma Network (MANI), therefore&#xD;
      representing a center of excellence and reference at a national level, with easy and wide&#xD;
      access to the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a 24-month, single-site observational retrospective and prospective&#xD;
      longitudinal cohort study involving asthmatic patients referred to the Asthma Center and&#xD;
      eligible for starting one of the biological therapy currently available. The patient will be&#xD;
      considered eligible only after having optimized adherence, inhalation technique, comorbidity&#xD;
      management and following a multidisciplinary assessment. Subjects will be monitored for 12&#xD;
      months and SA endpoints as well as other functional, clinical, laboratory and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes will be recorded at the beginning of the biological therapy (T0)&#xD;
      and after 3,6,12 months (T3, T6, T12). Values and changes in SA endpoints will be also&#xD;
      related to other functional, clinical and patient-reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following study procedures will be performed in the framework of the standard care for&#xD;
      severe asthmatic patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical history;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics data (such as age, sex, race et.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires (i.e. Asthma Control Test [ACT], Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ],&#xD;
           Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [AQLQ])&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary function tests (i.e. spirometry [Forced Expiratory volume in 1 second&#xD;
           (FEV1),Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, body plethysmography [Residual Volume&#xD;
           (RV), Total Lung Capacity (TLC), RV/TLC, impulse oscillometry as resistance at 5 and 20&#xD;
           Hz (R5, R20).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Airway inflammatory markers (i.e. fraction exhaled nitric oxide - FeNO)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergy tests (i.e. skin-prick tests and immunoassays for total and specific serum IgE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biological sampling (i.e. blood and sputum eosinophils).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging (i.e. chest XR and HRCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints The primary endpoint will be represented by the R5-R20 parameter registered&#xD;
      through impulsoscillometry. Baseline values and changes over the one-year follow-up period at&#xD;
      preplanned timepoints (i.e. 3, 6, and 12 months) will be recorded. According to literature&#xD;
      evidence, baseline values â‰¥0.07 support the evidence of small airways dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be represented by indirect parameters of SA involvement (i.e. TLC,&#xD;
      RV, TLC/RV, FEF25-75). Baseline values and changes over the one-year follow-up period at&#xD;
      preplanned timepoints (i.e. 3, 6, and 12 months) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variations in primary and secondary endpoints will be also related to changes in functional&#xD;
      parameters (i.e FEV1), clinical parameters (exacerbation rate), inflammatory markers (FeNO)&#xD;
      and patients' questionnaire scores (ACT, AQLQ, ACQ). Established minimal clinically important&#xD;
      difference (MCID) thresholds will be taken into consideration for correlation analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be performed using a statistical software.&#xD;
      Data will be tested for normality and will be expressed as mean (SD) or median (IQR).&#xD;
      Comparative analysis will be performed using parametric and non-parametric methods as&#xD;
      appropriate. Single and multiple linear regression analyses will be run to determine&#xD;
      correlation between small airway endpoints and clinical, functional, laboratory, and&#xD;
      patients' reported outcomes. A p-valueâ‰¥0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
      Most appropriate statistical analyses and models will be anyway chosen and run, following the&#xD;
      advice of statisticians at the institutional Department of Public Health. Considering the&#xD;
      &quot;R5-R20 Delta&quot;, measured through impulse oscillometry, as the primary endpoint for the study,&#xD;
      and aiming for a minimal difference of 0.02 (according to literature data), in order to have&#xD;
      an a error of 0.5 and a study power of 80%, at least 54 subjects will have to be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study. Documentation will be stored for a minimum of 10 years after the completion of the&#xD;
      study, including the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study significance and innovation Systems biology approaches are establishing the links&#xD;
      between disease pathways/mechanisms, and clinical/physiologic features. Validation of these&#xD;
      pathways may contribute to better defining severe asthma endotypes and treatable mechanisms.&#xD;
      Precision medicine approaches are necessary to link treatable mechanisms with treatable&#xD;
      traits and biomarkers derived from clinical, physiologic, inflammatory, molecular and genetic&#xD;
      variables. A deep and proper assessment of airway samples along with non-invasive biomarkers&#xD;
      may have a highly relevant translational significance and enable better knowledge and&#xD;
      management of severe asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk analysis No major difficulties are expected in view of the study's observational design.&#xD;
      No additional costs will be held.&#xD;
