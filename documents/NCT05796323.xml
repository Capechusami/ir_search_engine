      Workplace violence includes physical and verbal aggression as well as threatening behavior.&#xD;
      All types of workplace violence incidents in health care are often under-reported, especially&#xD;
      if there is no lasting physical injury.&#xD;

      Research reveals that healthcare workers are three times more likely to experience workplace&#xD;
      violence than any other occupation. The first step toward reducing the occurrence of violence&#xD;
      is to understand the perceptions and prevalence of workplace violence.&#xD;
