  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to learn if using a lay VA volunteer, who will assist patients with&#xD;
      education regarding precision medicine, can improve care quality and outcomes for Veteran&#xD;
      patients with lung cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in the intervention group will receive 1:1 communication with a lay VA volunteer&#xD;
      in addition to their usual clinical care. The lay VA volunteer will provide patients with&#xD;
      education about precision medicine and support in their care. Researchers will compare a&#xD;
      control group who will receive their usual oncology care as provided by clinical teams at the&#xD;
      VA. There will be no change in their care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to complete a survey at the time of enrollment in the study,&#xD;
      and also at 6 months. This survey will measure patient participation in their cancer care,&#xD;
      satisfaction with healthcare decisions, and overall questions about knowledge of precision&#xD;
      medicine.&#xD;

    <measure>Knowledge of precision medicine for cancer care from time of enrollment to 6 months post-enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Using 7 multiple choice items adapted from an 8-item survey tool, Knowledge and Purpose of Molecular Profiling, by Davies et. al., 2020, we will assess knowledge of precision medicine for cancer care at time of enrollment and again at 6-months post-enrollment. For example one question asks 'tumor testing is helpful for guiding the treatment of lung cancer,' with answer choices: yes or no. Answers will be scored as number or percent correct.</description>

    <measure>Patient activation using the &quot;Patient Activation Measure&quot; survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient will receive a validated patient activation survey using the &quot;Patient Activation Measure&quot; at baseline. This is a validated measure from Insignia Health. Responses are: disagree strongly, disagree, agree, agree strongly with higher activation correlated with responses of agree and agree strongly. Each item is rated on 4-point scale (1 strongly disagree to 4 strongly agree, with additional &quot;not applicable&quot; option). Higher scores indicate greater patient activation. For the PAM-10, minimum score is 0 (if all not-applicable) and maximum is 40. Raw scores are converted into activation levels per the scoring guidelines by Insignia Health for: level 1 Disengaged and Overwhelmed, level 2 Becoming Aware but Still Struggling, level 3 Taking Action and Gaining Control, level 4 Maintaining &quot;Behaviors and Pushing Further. Scores for each group will be averaged at baseline.</description>

Each item is rated on 4-point scale (1 strongly disagree to 4 strongly agree, with additional &quot;not applicable&quot; option). Higher scores indicate greater patient activation.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Using 7 items of the validated 9-item Shared Decision Making Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9) at baseline. Responses are &quot;completely disagree, strongly disagree, somewhat disagree, somewhat agree, strongly agree, or completely agree,&quot; with 1=completely disagree and 6= completely agree. Higher scores indicate greater levels of satisfaction.</description>
