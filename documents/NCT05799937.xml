      Goal of this prospective observational study is determine effect of smoking on periapical&#xD;
      healing after NSRCT. Population includes systemically healthy smokers with radiographic&#xD;
      evidence of apical periodontitis will be recruited and compared with same type of population&#xD;
      of non smokers after non surgical root canal treatment intervention in both the groups.&#xD;
      Outcome will be assessed using periapical index scoring system at 6 and 12 months follow up&#xD;
      period&#xD;

      The clinical and radiological success of primary non-surgical endodontic treatment in smoker&#xD;
      &amp; nonsmoker patients will be compared between both groups and smoking cessation effect on&#xD;
      periapical healing will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlation between the self-reported smoking status &amp; smoking status by urine analysis&#xD;

    <description>After administration of LA and rubber dam isolation, access cavity will be prepared using carbide burs in high speed hand piece with copious irrigation. Working length will be determined using root ZX apex locator and will be verified radiographically. Canal preparation will be done with rotary instruments . 5ml of 5.25% NaOCl will be used as irrigant after each instrument. After instrumentation , the canals will be irrigated with 5.0 ml of 17% EDTA for 1minute followed by irrigation with 5.0 ml of 5.25% NaOCl. Canals will be dried with absorbent paper points, filled with calcium hydroxide paste and access cavity will be restored with IRM. Patients will be recalled after 1 week.At the next appointment, after paste removal, copious irrigation with 5.25% NaOCl will be done and canals will be dried with paper points. Canals will be obturated with Gutta-Percha and ZOE based sealer.</description>
