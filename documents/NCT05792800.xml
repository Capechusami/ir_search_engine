  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease and dental caries have been regarded as the two most enormous worldwide&#xD;
      health burdens. Currently, the distribution and severity fluctuate within a single nation or&#xD;
      area and throughout the globe. According to epidemiological statistics, the frequency of&#xD;
      dental caries has decreased in most industrialized nations over the past few decades. It has&#xD;
      been suggested that it is due to the influence of multiple factors, including the use of&#xD;
      fluoride, enhanced oral hygiene including brushing and flossing, dietary changes, and&#xD;
      specific procedures performed in the dentist's office such as routine examinations, including&#xD;
      diagnostic radiographs, scaling and polishing, fluoride applications, and sealants. Dental&#xD;
      caries is a chronic, persistent dental condition that gets harder to cure as it progresses.&#xD;
      The contemporary dental practice's preventive strategy has been acknowledged as a key factor&#xD;
      in the recent drop in caries and a key component of the practice's service mix going forward.&#xD;
      One of the World Health Organization's (WHO) major actions for ongoing oral health&#xD;
      improvement is reorienting oral health services toward preventive and health promotion. A&#xD;
      preventative approach can reduce the burden of oral health problems, as cited by WHO.&#xD;
      Literature shows that although dentists' knowledge may be good, there are certain limitations&#xD;
      to applying the preventive approach, lack of positive attitude, and implications in daily&#xD;
      practice. With this background, the study aims to evaluate dental practitioners' knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes, and practice regarding caries preventive measures in Cairo compared to Riyadh.&#xD;
