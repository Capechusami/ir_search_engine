  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study aims to use electronic health records to build an International Big&#xD;
      Data Centre in Emergency Medicine, within the Institute of Sciences in Emergency Medicine&#xD;
      (ISEM) at the Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital. The main questions it seeks to answer&#xD;
      are not limited to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the relationship between Emergency Department Length of Stay (EDLOS),&#xD;
           Mortality, and Adverse Events (AE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the risk factors associated with high mortality and AE rate among patients who&#xD;
           experience prolonged EDLOS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other research questions related to emergency medicine, such as building prediction and&#xD;
           cluster models for acute diseases&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between the emergency department length-of-stay (EDLOS), mortality, and&#xD;
      adverse events (AE) rate remains unclear and underestimated. EDLOS is the time elapsed&#xD;
      between the time of arrival and the time of the release of a patient admitted to ED.&#xD;
      Mortality is defined as short-term (14 hours, 48 hours, 7 days, 15 days) and 30 days death of&#xD;
      patients managed in the ED discharged or admitted. An AE is an event that can result whether&#xD;
      from medical mismanagement or happen by accident and causes physical and mental harm to the&#xD;
      patient during the stay and remains after leaving. To separate the mismanagement from&#xD;
      accidental causes i.e., compliant management but the unfortunate situation or persons, this&#xD;
      study will refer to indicators that are objectively measurable and can be compared at&#xD;
      different times throughout the patient's stay in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that a prolonged stay of the patients in the ED especially without&#xD;
      diagnosis or decision of admission is associated with increased mortality and AEs. This&#xD;
      project will test this hypothesis through a prospective international multicenter study in&#xD;
      contributing to whether a prolonged EDLOS is associated with an increased rate of adverse&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
