  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pragmatic, prospective, multi-center, open label, randomized controlled, superiority trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare clinical outcomes between invasive versus non-invasive approach as&#xD;
      next diagnostic step in symptomatic patients with non-high risk obstructive coronary artery&#xD;
      disease (CAD) on coronary computed tomography-angiography (CCTA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CCTA has been emerged as useful diagnostic tool to evaluate CAD. Besides high diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy, CCTA has additional benefit of measuring the cumulative atherosclerotic burden and&#xD;
      more accurately discriminating obstructive CAD with additional fractional flow reserve by CT&#xD;
      (FFRCT), making it more predictive of a patient's prognosis. Recently, several randomized&#xD;
      clinical trials have demonstrated the clinical utility of CCTA when compared with noninvasive&#xD;
      stress test, which has been previously widely used as an initial assessment for stable chest&#xD;
      pain, or invasive coronary angiography, which is the gold standard for diagnosing obstructive&#xD;
      CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On this background, CCTA, along with stress imaging test, is recommended as first step to&#xD;
      diagnose obstructive CAD in patients with intermediate to high pretest probabilities with&#xD;
      stable chest pain and is increasingly utilized. Although CCTA is increasingly used as initial&#xD;
      assessment tool in these patients, there are insufficient studies to clearly establish the&#xD;
      next step after obstructive CAD is confirmed in CCTA. Without high-risk features of CAD on&#xD;
      CCTA, current guidelines suggest noninvasive stress imaging or FFRCT as class IIA&#xD;
      recommendation. However, supporting evidence of these suggestions are mostly based on studies&#xD;
      with low level of evidence. Furthermore, given the limited diagnostic performance of&#xD;
      noninvasive stress test, concern remains whether it is safe to defer invasive coronary&#xD;
      angiography based on the result from noninvasive stress test in patients with obstructive CAD&#xD;
      on CCTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this trial aims to compare clinical outcomes between invasive versus non-invasive&#xD;
      approach as next diagnostic step in symptomatic patients with non-high risk obstructive CAD&#xD;
      on CCTA.&#xD;
