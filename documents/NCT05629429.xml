  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, is proven as an effective therapy for germline BRCA1/2-mutated&#xD;
      breast cancer; however, the therapeutic efficacy for somatic mutation in BRCA1/2 or genes of&#xD;
      homologous recombination DNA repair is unclear. Maintenance of Oalaprib can delay the disease&#xD;
      progression in patients with BRCA1/2 mutated advanced ovarian cancer after treatment with&#xD;
      platinum based chemotherapy. The investigators design a phase 2 study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of maintenance of Olaparib in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The&#xD;
      investigators enroll patients with metastatic ER(+)Her2(-) or triple-negative breast cancer.&#xD;
      Patients who are chemotherapy-naïve or prior 1-line chemotherapy are eligible for screening.&#xD;
      All eligible patients will receive 4 cycles of platinum based chemotherapy. Gene test will be&#xD;
      performed on their breast tumor. If patients have mutation of HR genes and at least stable&#xD;
      disease after platinum based chemotherapy, they will be randomized to treatment arm (Olaparib&#xD;
      maintenance) or control arm (continuation of chemotherapy). The primary end-point is&#xD;
      progression-free survival, and the secondary end-point is to assess the response rate,&#xD;
      overall survival and quality of life.&#xD;
