    <textblock>
      Clinical and animal studies have found that sepsis can lead to a serious imbalance in the gut&#xD;
      microecology, a reduction in probiotics, a reduction in short-chain fatty acid, a reduction&#xD;
      in bone mass, and an increase in bone destruction, maintaining the stability of microecology&#xD;
      can be one of the effective means of bone protection. But at present, the treatment of sepsis&#xD;
      with early supplementation of probiotics is still controversial, and dietary fiber intake has&#xD;
      significantly changed the composition of the microbiota, it may be a safe and effective&#xD;
      method to prevent bone loss in sepsis. Further study on it will provide reliable theoretical&#xD;
      basis and intervention target for early, safe and effective prevention of osteoporosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, researchers have found that the incidence of bone loss in ICU patients is&#xD;
      significantly higher than that in the control group of the same age, patients with sepsis&#xD;
      whose bone balance is disrupted by higher overresorption, bone destruction and release of&#xD;
      multiple active cytokines and toxins become the&quot;Invisible killer&quot;of the ICU, however, the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of osteoporosis is not clear, and the existing drugs for osteoporosis can not be&#xD;
      safely used in critically ill patients. The gastrointestinal tract is the&quot;Initiating&#xD;
      organ&quot;and&quot;Central organ&quot; of multiple organ dysfunction and forms a complex and&#xD;
      powerful&quot;Gut-bone axis&quot;with bone, which plays a key role in bone metabolism, but the&#xD;
      mechanism is unclear. The human gut contains a dense and diverse microbial community, which&#xD;
      plays an important role in nutrition, metabolism and immunity, small intestinal microecology&#xD;
      can affect bone turnover through a variety of pathways, especially the metabolite short-chain&#xD;
      fatty acid FAS (SCFAs) , which can inhibit osteoclast activity by regulating inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines and immune cells, promote the formation of osteoblasts and other aspects to&#xD;
      maintain the stability of bone metabolism, and then protect the health of bones, forming&#xD;
      a&quot;Gut-microcology-bone&quot;axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and animal studies have found that sepsis can lead to a serious imbalance in the gut&#xD;
      microecology, a reduction in probiotics, a reduction in short-chain fatty acid, a reduction&#xD;
      in bone mass, and an increase in bone destruction, maintaining the stability of microecology&#xD;
      can be one of the effective means of bone protection. But at present, the treatment of sepsis&#xD;
      with early supplementation of probiotics is still controversial, and dietary fiber intake has&#xD;
      significantly changed the composition of the microbiota, it may be a safe and effective&#xD;
      method to prevent bone loss in sepsis. Further study on it will provide reliable theoretical&#xD;
      basis and intervention target for early, safe and effective prevention of osteoporosis.&#xD;
      Therefore, based on the above research background, Investigators intend to evaluate the&#xD;
      overall safety and efficacy of dietary fiber-containing enteral nutrition supplementation in&#xD;
      patients with sepsis by observing changes in bone metabolism-related indicators, to provide&#xD;
      the basis for further basic and mechanism research&#xD;
