  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching hypotheses of this protocol are that (1) persistent brain glutamate changes&#xD;
      induced by chronic opioid use will exacerbate use of cocaine during opioid physical&#xD;
      dependence and withdrawal and (2) n-acetylcysteine (NAC) will ameliorate glutamatergic&#xD;
      dysregulation, and thus will reduce both opioid and cocaine demand. These hypotheses will be&#xD;
      tested with two specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. Determine the reinforcing effects of cocaine in individuals with comorbid&#xD;
      opioid and cocaine use disorder with physiological dependence on opioids during NAC&#xD;
      maintenance. All subjects will be maintained on oral hydromorphone. They will also be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive placebo or oral NAC (2.4 g/day), stratified by sex. After dose&#xD;
      stabilization, experimental sessions will be conducted in which subjects complete&#xD;
      hypothetical cocaine purchase tasks during opioid maintenance and opioid withdrawal. The&#xD;
      hypotheses are: 1) cocaine purchasing will be greater during opioid withdrawal and 2) NAC&#xD;
      maintenance will attenuate cocaine purchasing across opioid maintenance and withdrawal&#xD;
      periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. Evaluate glutamate functionality during periods of opioid maintenance and&#xD;
      withdrawal in individuals with comorbid opioid and cocaine use disorder and physiological&#xD;
      dependence on opioids during NAC maintenance. Subjects will undergo magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy to evaluate brain glutamate changes as a function of opioid&#xD;
      maintenance/withdrawal state and NAC maintenance. The hypotheses are: 1) glutamate levels&#xD;
      will be elevated during opioid withdrawal and 2) NAC maintenance will ameliorate elevated&#xD;
      glutamate levels.&#xD;

             participation,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Potential subjects that meet diagnostic criteria for moderate - severe substance use&#xD;
             disorder for substances other than opioids, stimulants, cannabis, or nicotine at the&#xD;

             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
