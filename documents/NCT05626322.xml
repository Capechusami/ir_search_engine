  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the effects of three study medicines&#xD;
      (PF-07901801, tafasitamab, and lenalidomide) when given together for the treatment of diffuse&#xD;
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is relapsed (has returned after last treatment) or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is refractory (has not responded to last treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      DLBCL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). NHL is a cancer of the lymphatic system. It&#xD;
      develops when the body makes abnormal B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are a type of white&#xD;
      blood cell that normally help to fight infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is seeking participants who are unable or unwilling to undergo a stem cell&#xD;
      transplant. Stem cell transplant is when doctors put healthy blood cells back into your body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Everyone in this study will receive all three medicines. Participants will receive&#xD;
      PF-07901801 and tafasitamab at the study clinic by intravenous (IV) infusion (given directly&#xD;
      into a vein). Study interventions will be administered in 28-day cycles. PF-0791801 will be&#xD;
      given weekly for the first three cycles and then every two weeks. Tafasitamab will&#xD;
      administered on Days 1, 4, 8, 15 and 22 in cycle 1, weekly in cycles 2 and 3 and then every 2&#xD;
      weeks in cycle 4 and beyond. Lenalidomide will be taken by mouth at home every day for Days 1&#xD;
      to 21 of each 28-day cycle for the first 12 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can continue to take PF-07901801 and tafasitamab until their lymphoma is no&#xD;
      longer responding. Lenalidomide is discontinued after 12 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PF-07901801 will be given at different doses to different participants. Everyone taking part&#xD;
      will receive approved doses of tafasitamab and lenalidomide. We will compare the experiences&#xD;
      of people receiving different doses of PF-07901801. This will help us to determine what dose&#xD;
      is safe and effective dose when combined with the other 2 study medicines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      potential clinical benefits of PF-07901801, an anti-CD47 molecule, in combination with&#xD;
      standard doses of tafasitamab and lenalidomide in participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R)&#xD;
      DLBCL not eligible for or unwilling to undergo high dose chemotherapy and subsequent&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or unable to receive approved chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy (for example, due to logistical limitations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Phase 1b, participants must have previously received at least 1 prior systemic treatment&#xD;
      regimen. For Phase 2, participants must have received at least 1 but no more than 2 prior&#xD;
      systemic treatment regimens. All participants must have previously received an anti-CD20&#xD;
      containing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1b will assess dose-limiting toxicities of PF-07901801 when administered in combination&#xD;
      with tafasitamab and lenalidomide, to select up to 2 doses for the Phase 2 part of the study.&#xD;
      Phase 2 will evaluate safety and efficacy to determine the recommended Phase 3 dose of&#xD;
      PF-07901801 to be administered in combination with tafasitamab and lenalidomide.&#xD;
