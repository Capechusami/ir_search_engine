      This open-label, randomized multicenter study is to assess the efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) of obinutuzumab compared with mycophenolate&#xD;
      mofetil (MMF) in children and young adults (aged &gt;= 2-25 years) with frequently relapsing&#xD;
      nephrotic syndrome (FRNS) or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (SDNS).&#xD;
