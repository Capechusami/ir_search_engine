  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical trial is to determine the safety of an intravenously&#xD;
      administered radioisotope, RAD301 ([68Ga]-Trivehexin), in either health volunteers or&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening, which entails physical examination and blood samples for standard blood testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that successfully pass screening will undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gallium-68 PET scanning procedures, which will occur during a single day (about 5-6 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These subjects will return to the clinic at 2 weeks for additional safety labs. All scanned&#xD;
      subjects will also be evaluated by telephone follow up on a weekly basis for 1 month after&#xD;
      scanning.&#xD;

      Intervention Description: Single administrations of a radiopharmaceutical at a dose below the&#xD;
      no observable (pharmacological) effect level (NOEL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To characterize the radiation and radiochemical safety profile of RAD301&#xD;
      in healthy adults and patients with PDAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Radiation Absorbed Doses in internal organs, in units of mGy and mSv;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Changes in VSs and ECGs, such as the PR and QTcF intervals; as percentages and absolute&#xD;
           values approaching critical safety zones;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Changes in clinical laboratory tests of internal organ function; as percentages and&#xD;
           absolute values outside the reference ranges of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy volunteers (N=3) and patients with pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC; N=6) age 18 and older (no upper limit). Patients may be at any stage of&#xD;
      their illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a Phase 1a, open label, single dose, extended study of safety and biokinetics of&#xD;
      RAD301 in three healthy human volunteers (HV) and six patients with pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The procedures will be nearly identical in both groups, but there&#xD;
      could be more scans in HVs during the day and fewer in patients during the same time interval&#xD;
      simply because patients might not have the tolerance for lying still on an imaging table for&#xD;
      very long. In all participants, vital signs (VSs) will be measured, electrocardiograms (ECGs)&#xD;
      will be acquired, and blood will be sent to the clinical laboratory for safety assessments&#xD;
      before-and-after a single dose, intravenous (IV) administration of the investigational&#xD;
      radiopharmaceutical, RAD301. Vital signs (VSs) will be re-measured, electrocardiograms (ECGs)&#xD;
      will be acquired again, and additional blood will be sent to the clinical laboratory for&#xD;
      repeat safety assessments at multiple times post-injection (p.i.). There will be two (2)&#xD;
      whole body (WB) PET-CT scanning sessions. The initial PET scanning session starts at the time&#xD;
      of injection by acquiring dynamic images of the heart and aorta to quantify the&#xD;
      imaging-derived input function (IDIF). After approximately 6-to-10 minutes, scanning will&#xD;
      shift to acquiring WB images of up to 200 cm from head-to-toe, with 150 cm much more typical&#xD;
      because the knees will be bolstered, and the neck will be flexed. The initial WB acquisition&#xD;
      should take approximately ten (10) minutes. As time passes and less and less radioactivity is&#xD;
      localizable to the distal extremities, the scan length may be decreased from&#xD;
      vertex-to-thighs. The duration of each scan may increase to partially compensate for&#xD;
      radioactive decay. More than one WB scan may be performed in volunteers during the first&#xD;
      imaging session, but only one scan will be required in patients with PDAC who are not feeling&#xD;
      well. The subjects will then be given a rest period (&quot;lunch break&quot;) after which the sequence&#xD;
      of events could be repeated. This second imaging session will be optional, and depend on the&#xD;
      robustness of the subject AND the availability of the clinical scanner. There will be one&#xD;
      last, or &quot;final&quot; imaging session at the end of the day for all subjects, which will strive to&#xD;
      include the time interval after about four (4) physical half-lives of Gallium-68. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measure will be related to radiation safety. Estimates of radiation absorbed doses&#xD;
      will be derived from the areas under the time-activity curves (AUCs) for internal organs.&#xD;
      Co-primary clinical safety measures will include changes in vital signs, ECG parameters (such&#xD;
      as the PR and corrected QT intervals) and clinical laboratory tests (such as white blood cell&#xD;
      counts that are indicative of immune system activation and proteins that reflect excretory&#xD;
      function). Secondary endpoints will include the time-activity curves (TACs) and total volumes&#xD;
      of distribution (VT) of radiopharmaceutical in the internal organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be in the study for up to eight (8) weeks from the time they first meet with&#xD;
      the study team until the last telephone call. Screening may occur anytime for up to five (5)&#xD;
      weeks before the first PET imaging procedure. The two imaging sessions will take&#xD;
      approximately one day. One physical visit at the site for clinical safety lab and&#xD;
      surveillance of adverse events two (2) weeks after administration of RAD301 will take about&#xD;
      20 minutes. Follow up surveillance for adverse events takes about 10 minutes per phone at day&#xD;
      2, week 1, and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time a subject will need to set aside during each period will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pre-study telephone screening should take less than 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Period 1: screening. Two (2) hours or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Period 2: RAD301 ([68Ga]-Trivehexin) administration and serial safety studies with PET&#xD;
           imaging sessions. One day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Period 3: one month for post study surveillance of adverse events (AEs) with one&#xD;
           physical visit at the site for standard blood lab safety testing 2 weeks after&#xD;
           administration of RAD301 and phone calls of about 5-to-20 minutes or less on Day 2, Day&#xD;
           8, and Day 29, all +/- 2 days, after the PET scanning session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first in-person screening session will take about two hours. The sessions encompassing&#xD;
      serial PET scans will take approximately one day, nominally corresponding to five (5)&#xD;
      physical half-lives of [68Ga]. Follow up phone calls for AE surveillance should take less&#xD;
      than 15 minutes or less each.&#xD;
