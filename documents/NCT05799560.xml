  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress and anxiety form an integral part of organizational life in universities. Studies&#xD;
      reveal that the stress experienced by academicians has increased dramatically in recent&#xD;
      years. Stress affects employee performance. In order to reduce the stress level of female&#xD;
      academicians, methods such as non-pharmacological treatment, massage that can be applied to&#xD;
      support scientific medicine, acupressure, hot and cold application, therapeutic touch should&#xD;
      be used. The non-pharmacological methods that investigators will look at in our research are&#xD;
      therapeutic touch and reiki. The improvement of the balance in the body and the reduction of&#xD;
      negative effects such as pain, stress and anxiety with non-pharmacological touch methods are&#xD;
      explained by Gate Control and Endorphin theories. The universe of the research will be female&#xD;
      academicians working at Osmaniye Korkut Ata University. participants will be determined by&#xD;
      the block randomization method. Data; It will be collected using the Introductory Information&#xD;
      Form, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Level Assessment Form. TT and Reiki application will&#xD;
      have positive contributions as it is a non-pharmacological method, easy to apply and low&#xD;
      cost. When the studies were examined, no other study was found in the same application as our&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effect of therapeutic touch and reiki&#xD;
      practice on anxiety and stress levels in female academicians.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Dass-21 scale consists of 21 items that examine depression, anxiety and stress under three headings.&#xD;
This scale is a 4-point Likert-type scale and consists of 7 questions each measuring &quot;depression, stress and anxiety dimensions&quot;.&#xD;
Subjects are asked to mark four different score types (0, 1, 2, and 3) opposite to each sentence according to the severity and frequency of their feelings, how they have felt in the last few weeks.&#xD;
If the given sentence does not fit the person at all, it is required to mark 0, if it is a satellite to some extent, 1 if it is a satellite to some extent, 2 if it is a satellite to a significant degree, and 3 if it is exactly a satellite.&#xD;
Then, the scores for each scale are summed and depression, anxiety and stress scores are found.&#xD;
Getting 5 points or more from depression sub-dimension, 4 points or more from anxiety, 8 points or more from stress indicates that the individual has a related problem.</description>
