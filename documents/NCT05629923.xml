      The goal of this observational study is to evaluate the immune response after COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccination in Liver(LT) and Kidney(KT) transplant recipient. The main question it aims to&#xD;
      answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the evaluation of the antibody response after complete vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the efficacy of prophylaxis with long-acting-antibody prophylaxis (LAAB)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All LT and KT patients during follow-up have been enrolled. anti-COVID-19 title was obtained&#xD;
      by Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) Test(Elyx, Roche). In the case of antibody&#xD;
      level &lt;100 IU/ml, patients were invited to prophylaxis with tixagevimab-cilgavimab(AZD7442,&#xD;
      AstraZeneca). At three months, a follow-up was performed to assess any COVID-19 infection. At&#xD;
      Six months another anti-COVID-19 title is obtained by ECLIA Test(Elyx, Roche) in LT and KT&#xD;
      who undergo to LAAB.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver(LT) and kidney(KT) transplant patients are at high risk of mortality from&#xD;
      COVID-19(16-29%, 28%; respectively). Although transplant patients undergo a full vaccination&#xD;
      course(3 doses), they are frequently low-responders and long-acting-antibody prophylaxis&#xD;
      (LAAB) has been proposed. However, the efficacy of these strategies has not yet been&#xD;
      demonstrated in LT and KT.&#xD;
