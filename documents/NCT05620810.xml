  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compared to the United Kingdom and the United States, Spontaneous non-traumatic intracerebral&#xD;
      hemorrhage (ICH) is more common among people in Taiwan. The prevalence rate of ICH was 14.0%&#xD;
      for people aged 36 years or older in Taiwan. Primary ICH originates from the spontaneous&#xD;
      rupture of small vessels damaged by chronic hypertension or cerebral amyloid angiopathy&#xD;
      (CAA). Emotional disturbances are frequent symptoms in stroke survivors and negatively impact&#xD;
      on functional recovery, the patient's quality of life and are distressing for both the&#xD;
      patients and their caregivers. Furthermore, the emotional disturbances are associated with&#xD;
      impaired cognitive. However, these issues are often unnoticed and most of the studies had&#xD;
      been performed in ischemic stroke survivors rather than in patients with ICH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will be recruited participants from National Taiwan University Hospital&#xD;
      Bei-Hu branch and National Taiwan University Hospital. We aim to enroll respectively maximum&#xD;
      number of 60 patients who had previous spontaneous ICH. Each participant will receive&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric assessment, cognitive screening tests, domain-specific cognitive tests, a&#xD;
      questionnaire for their quality of life and blood drawing for ApoE genotyping. The main aims&#xD;
      of this study include (1) To investigate the prevalence of distinct neuropsychiatric symptoms&#xD;
      in ICH survivors (2) To investigate the impact of non-cognitive neuropsychiatric issues on&#xD;
      the cognitive functions and quality of life in ICH survivors. Our results may remind&#xD;
      clinicians to pay more attention to the early diagnosis and effective management of&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric symptoms to improve clinical outcomes.&#xD;
