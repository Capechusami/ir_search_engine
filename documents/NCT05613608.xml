      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study designed to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of full spectrum CBD and broad spectrum CBD, compared to a placebo control (PC), to&#xD;
      reduce drinking in participants with alcohol use disorder. If eligible for the study,&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to receive one of the conditions for 12 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To better understand the effects of hemp-derived CBD with and without a small amount of THC,&#xD;
      we propose a Phase II randomized clinical trial (RCT) to examine the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and clinical effects of Full Spectrum CBD (fsCBD, contains less than 0.3% THC) vs. Broad&#xD;
      Spectrum CBD (bsCBD, does not contain THC), vs. a matching placebo in a population of AUD&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study designed to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of fsCBD and bsCBD, compared to a placebo control, to reduce drinking in&#xD;
      participants with moderate alcohol use disorder according to the DSM-V. If eligible for the&#xD;
      study, subjects will be randomized to receive one of the conditions for 12 weeks. The current&#xD;
      study will test the hypothesis that a moderate dose of CBD leads to a reduction in alcohol&#xD;
      consumption, alcohol craving, peripheral markers of inflammation, and anxiety. It is further&#xD;
      hypothesized that CBD will lead to increased sleep duration and quality among individuals&#xD;
      with AUD who want to quit or reduce their drinking. The study will also determine whether the&#xD;
      small amount of THC found in full spectrum hemp-derived CBD products produces any negative&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Drinks per Drinking Day</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Time Line Follow Back is a calendar-assisted measure that can be used to assess alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and other substance use. The investigators will use this measure to create the Drinks per Drinking Day variable.</description>

    <measure>Change in Alcohol Dependence/Craving</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The AUDIT consists of ten questions that cover such domains as alcohol consumption, drinking behavior, adverse psychological reactions, and alcohol-related problems. HDD and alcohol dependence/craving are the primary behavioral outcomes that will be analyzed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cue-reactivity</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cue-elicited urge to drink will be assessed using the cue-reactivity assessment, per protocol (Hutchison, 2006).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale is a 21-item self-report instrument for measuring the three related negative emotional states of depression, anxiety, and tension/stress. Participants rate their anxiety on a scale from 1 (Did not apply to me at all) to 4 (Applied to me very much/most of the time), with higher scores indicating worse outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Numeric Rating Scale v1.0 - Pain Intensity - 1a consists of a single item rating pain on average over the past 7 days from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain you can think of). Participants are also asked to rate the impact of their pain in the last 7 days. The PROMIS Short Form v1.1 - Pain Interference - 6b rates pain on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much), as it refers to the degree to which pain limits or interferes with subjects' physical, mental, and social activities.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sleep Disturbance</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Short Form v.1.0 - Sleep Disturbance - 4a will be used to measure self-reported perceptions of sleep quality, depth, and restoration within the past seven days. This includes perceived difficulties falling asleep and staying asleep, as well as sleep satisfaction.</description>
