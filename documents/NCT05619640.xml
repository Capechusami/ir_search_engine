  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 causes a wide spectrum of clinical illness, from upper respiratory symptoms to&#xD;
      severe respiratory failure and death. Several plasma biomarkers -such as IL-6, C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (CRP), D-dimer, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and ferritin, among others- have&#xD;
      been studied as markers of disease severity and prognosis. Besides, as alveolar damage&#xD;
      biomarkers such as Surfactant protein D (SP-D), Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6), and soluble&#xD;
      Receptor for Advanced Glycation end products (sRAGE) can be used in lung diseases as well as&#xD;
      COVID-19 pneumonia. The investigators hypothesized that serum SP-D, KL-6 and sRAGE levels&#xD;
      increases in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia. In this prospective study the investigators&#xD;
      aimed to determine the clinical value of serum KL-6, SP-D and sRAGE levels as a prognostic&#xD;
      marker in children with COVID-19 patients. In the literature review, it has been determined&#xD;
      that there is no study conducted or published in pediatric patients for this purpose, and it&#xD;
      is aimed that our study will be a pioneer study on this subject.&#xD;

      It aimed to determine the clinical value of serum KL-6, SP-D and sRAGE levels as a prognostic&#xD;
      marker in children with COVID-19 patients.. This study was planned as a case-control study&#xD;
      with patients hospitalized in the Haseki Training and Research Hospital Pediatric Infection&#xD;
      Ward. A total of 150 children, including at least 30 patients in each group were included in&#xD;
      the study. The study group was divided into three groups according to COVID-19 WHO clinical&#xD;
      progression Scale: uninfected (Group 1), mild (Group 2) and moderate (group 3). In order to&#xD;
      investigate the relationship between disease severity and alveolar damage, serum KL-6, SP-D&#xD;
      and sRAGE levels and high sensitive C-reactive protein were measured. These biomarkers levels&#xD;
      were compared between three groups.&#xD;

    <description>Serum samples were obtained from all patients on admission. The data set divided into three groups according to COVID-19 WHO Clinical progression scale. The Surfactant protein D, Krebs von den Lungen-6, high sensitive C-reactive protein and soluble receptor for Advanced Glycation end products levels were determined by using ELISA kits. These biomarker levels were compared between three groups by using Kruskal-Wallis test and Tukey post test for multiple comparisons.</description>
