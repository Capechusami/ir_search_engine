      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of the current recommended&#xD;
      guidelines for physical activity (PA) in response to acute moderate intensity continous&#xD;
      exercise (MICE) and high intensity interval exercise (HIIE) among adolescents with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes (T1D) using automated insulin delivery (AID) systems (MiniMed 780G and Tandem&#xD;
      Control-IQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a two-period, cross-over, clinical trial with between and within cohort&#xD;
      comparisons of two different exercise modalities among a total of 24 age-, sex-, and&#xD;
      insulin-dose-matched adolescents with T1D (12 using MiniMed 780G and 12 using Tandem&#xD;
      Control-IQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is sensor-derived time in range (3.9 mmol/L-10.0 mmol/L) around exercise&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants included in the study will perform a cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET)&#xD;
      before the exercise study visits, to prescribe subsequent exercise intensity thresholds.&#xD;
      Participants will have a canula placed in a antecubital vein for plasma sampling during the&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undertake two exercise visits each including a bout of exercise on a&#xD;
      stationary bicycle of either one of two exercise modalities; i.) high-intensity interval&#xD;
      exercise with sprints at ~85% of VO2max (HIIE); ii.) moderate intensity continuous exercise&#xD;
      at ~60% of VO2max (MICE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will arrive at the research facility, Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen, in the&#xD;
      afternoon. As per the current recommended guidelines, the MICE-session will be announced to&#xD;
      the AID systems 60 minutes in advance, whereas the HIIE-session will not be announced.&#xD;
      Participants will have a canula placed in a antecubital vein for plasma sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will rest for 60 minutes, exercise for 45 minutes and rest again for 75 minutes&#xD;
      before leaving the research facility. During exercise participants will be fitted with a&#xD;
      spirometry face mask to compute ventilatory thresholds and indirect calorimetry (Vyaire&#xD;
      VyntusÂ® CPX, Intramedic A/S) and a telemetry chest strap (Polar H10) for integrated HR heart&#xD;
      rate (HR) measurements with the spirometry device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the MICE session: After 15 minutes post-exercise rest the temporary target/exercise mode&#xD;
      is turned off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around each study visit (24 hours prior until 24 hours after), sensor glucose as well as&#xD;
      sleep and physical activity will be recorded. Sensor glucose will be measured by&#xD;
      participants' own devices. Sleep and physical activity level will be assessed with a&#xD;
      wrist-worn accelerometer, ActiGraph wGT3X-BT (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study days will be separated by at least three days.&#xD;
