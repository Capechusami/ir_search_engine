  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The supraspinatus muscle tendinopathy show a big impact, however, there is a lack of&#xD;
      awareness about the options of the physiotherapist treatment. It is necessary to do studies&#xD;
      about effectiveness of therapeutic percutaneous electrolysis and neuromodulation. This&#xD;
      technique enables treatment of the tendinopathies. To analyze the effectiveness of&#xD;
      therapeutic percutaneou electrolysis and neuromodulation in the treatment of supraspinatus&#xD;
      muscle tendinopathy. Single center randomized controlled trial, parallel treatment design. A&#xD;
      specialist physician will be diagnosed the supraspinatus muscle tendinopathy. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to receive treatmen for 4 weeks: percutaneou electrolysis and&#xD;
      neuromodulation associated with eccentric exercises or conventional treatment of&#xD;
      Physiotherapy with the same eccentric exercises. Both interventions were performed under&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance with a portable ultrasound (General Electric LogicE). Data will be&#xD;
      collected by a blinded evaluator.&#xD;

      Eccentric exercises of the supraspinatus muscle were performed in 3 sets of 10 repetitions.&#xD;
      Participants were asked to perform the exercise program on an individual basis twice every&#xD;
      day for 4 weeks. The eccentric program consisted of 3 exercises, focusing on the&#xD;
      supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and scapular muscles. Participants were asked to do a normal&#xD;
      abduction (concentric phase) and a slow return to the initial position (eccentric phase)&#xD;
      included first the concentric phase, and the eccentric phase was slowly conducted. The&#xD;
      exercise program was taught by a physiotherapist in the first session and monitored in the&#xD;
      subsequent sessions.&#xD;

    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use. Both dimensions account for 50% of the overall score, and scores from 0 to 100.</description>

    <description>SF-12 questionnaire is a reliable measure of perceived health that describes the degree of general physical health status and mental health distress. It consists of 12 items, derived from the physical and mental domains. In our study SF-12 was considered altered if the score was &lt;40, either from the physical or mental functioning point of view, because means of 50 and standard deviations of 10 are usually achieved in the general population.</description>
