    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to learn more about the safety, side effects, and&#xD;
      effectiveness of LOXO-435. LOXO-435 may be used to treat cancer of the cells that line the&#xD;
      urinary system and other solid tumor cancers that have a change in a particular gene (known&#xD;
      as the FGFR3 gene). Participation could last up to 30 months (2.5 years) and possibly longer&#xD;
      if the disease does not get worse.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is an open-label, multi-center, phase 1a/b study in participants with FGFR3-altered&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors, including metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC). The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in 2 phases: Dose escalation (1a) and dose expansion (1b). Phase 1a will assess&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of LOXO-435 to determine the recommended phase 2&#xD;
      dose (RP2D). Phase 1b will include 4 dose expansion cohorts of patients with prespecified&#xD;
      activating FGFR3 alterations to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LOXO-435 at the RP2D.&#xD;
      Cohort B will enroll pts with mUC and includes three cohorts to evaluate LOXO-435 as&#xD;
      monotherapy (B1, B2) and in combination with pembrolizumab (B3). Cohort C will enroll pts&#xD;
      with non-UC advanced solid tumors and includes a cohort to evaluate LOXO-435 as monotherapy&#xD;
      (C1).&#xD;
