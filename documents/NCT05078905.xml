      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have been highly effective&#xD;
      against preventing severe disease. But the protective effects of these vaccines appear to&#xD;
      wane over time. Researchers want to learn why.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about how the immune system responds to vaccines against infections like&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adults ages 18 or older who are scheduled to receive either a new vaccine or a&#xD;
      booster shot against SARS-COV-2 or another emerging infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have up to 8 study visits in 1 year. Each visit should last less than 2&#xD;
      hours. At each visit, participants will give blood samples. Some blood samples will be used&#xD;
      for genetic testing. They will also give updates on their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first study visit, participants will receive either a first vaccination or a&#xD;
      booster shot. They must get the vaccine in their community or workplace. They will not get&#xD;
      the vaccine at NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study currently focuses on SARS-CoV-2, but it will expand to other infectious diseases&#xD;
      as they emerge and become the target of new vaccines.&#xD;

      Study Description: This protocol will enroll up to 200 adults per year who are scheduled to&#xD;
      be vaccinated against severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or other&#xD;
      emerging pathogens.Participants will provide blood samples prior to and serially&#xD;
      aftervaccination. The blood will be used to perform research studies of the immune response&#xD;
      to primary (new) and secondary (booster) vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Characterize longitudinal serologic and cellular responses to vaccination&#xD;
      to SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging&#xD;
&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate baseline correlates of immune response to vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Correlate cellular and serologic responses after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For vaccines that require two or more doses; characterize the immunologic responses&#xD;
           following both the primary (new) and&#xD;
&#xD;
           the secondary (booster) dose(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the longevity of immune responses to primary (new) and secondary (booster)&#xD;
           vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: Primary Endpoint: Establish immunologically well characterized cohorts of primary&#xD;
      (new) and secondary (booster) vaccinated individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: Establish factors associated with longevity of serologic and cellular&#xD;
      responses to primary (new) and secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
      (booster) vaccination.&#xD;

        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the&#xD;
             duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hemoglobin &gt;= 9.0 grams per deciliter (g/dL) or &gt;= 11.2 for women who are pregnant.&#xD;
