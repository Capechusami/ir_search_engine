  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate safety and efficacy of intravenous delivery of&#xD;
      EXG001-307 as a treatment of spinal muscular atrophy Type 1 (SMN1).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate safety and efficacy of gene therapy in spinal muscular atrophy Type 1&#xD;
      (SMA1) patients. SMA is caused by low levels of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, and&#xD;
      affects all muscles in the body. There is no effective treatment for SMA and current drug&#xD;
      therapy has been unsuccessful in stabilizing or reversing this disease. Only supportive care&#xD;
      is currently possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label, dose-escalation clinical trial of EXG001-307 injected intravenously through a&#xD;
      peripheral limb vein. Short-term safety will be evaluated over a 1.5 year period. Patients&#xD;
      will be tested at baseline and return for follow up visits on days 14, 21, 30, followed by&#xD;
      once every month through 12 months post dose, and then every three months through a year and&#xD;
      a half post infusion. Unscheduled visits may occur if the PI determines that they are&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis for efficacy will be assessed when all patients reach 18 months of age&#xD;
      (a database lock will be performed at the time point at which all patients reach 18 months of&#xD;
      age). A follow-up safety analysis will be completed at the time point at which the last&#xD;
      patient reaches 18 months of age after post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the 1.5-year study period, patients will be monitored annually as per&#xD;
      standard of care for up to 5 years.&#xD;
