  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a growing global health problem, strictly connected with&#xD;
      progressive ageing population and longer survival of patients living on renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy. The majority of ESRD patients is on hemodialysis (HD) treatment. A successful HD&#xD;
      procedure requires a functioning vascular access (VA) to provide safe and long-lasting way to&#xD;
      connect patient circulation to the artificial kidney. The current recommendation for VA is&#xD;
      the native arteriovenous fistula (AVF), surgically created in the forearm by an anastomosis&#xD;
      between a vein and an artery. The AVF, despite being the first-choice treatment, is still&#xD;
      affected by high non-maturation and early failure rates, requiring in most of the cases, the&#xD;
      creation of a new VA. An arteriovenous graft (AVG) is the second choice for a VA. Surgery is&#xD;
      done using an artificial plastic tube that connects an artery to a vein. The AVG matures&#xD;
      earlier than AVF (2/3 vs 6 weeks), but it is more prone to infections and has lower survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would be important to identify patients at risk of VA failure, but there is currently a&#xD;
      lack of adequate strategies for surveillance. A continuous monitoring of the VA function&#xD;
      would help in identification of reduced blood flow and VA stenosis, that could be treated by&#xD;
      interventional radiologists before AVF or AVG complete closure. Over the years, nurses and&#xD;
      nephrologists got used to touch the VA and qualitatively evaluate its vibration, named&#xD;
      &quot;thrill&quot;, and the sounds emitted by the same using their stethoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of VA sound recording and analysis and&#xD;
      provide preliminary evidence of VA sound clinical validity and utility to assess, monitor and&#xD;
      predict vascular remodelling occurring in AVFs and AVGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center prospective observational study involving the acquisition of VA&#xD;
      sounds and Doppler US examinations in consenting patients with ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reach this goal, two groups of ESRD patients in need of VA surgery to perform HD treatment&#xD;
      will be involved:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1. Patients with AVF as first line HD access option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2. Patients with AVG as first line HD access option.&#xD;

        The study will be performed in patients with ESRD enrolled at the Nephrology and Dialysis&#xD;
        Department of the ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII (Bergamo, Italy). VA sounds and Doppler US data&#xD;
        will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patients of both groups (AVF and AVG) will undergo visit V1 (screening and enrolment).&#xD;
        On day 0 they will have the surgery for VA creation (V2). Then the study follow-up visits&#xD;
        will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At 7, 14, 28, 42 and 60 days after VA surgery (V3, V4, V5, V6, V7)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Once every 3 months from the third month to two years after VA surgery (V8, …, ENDV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be asked to provide consent for the use of their clinical and laboratory data&#xD;
        collected during routine clinical practice over 10 years following the end of this study.&#xD;
        Refusal to this consent will not prevent from participating in the study.&#xD;
