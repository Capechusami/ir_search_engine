    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common disease that refers to involuntary loss of urine. The&#xD;
      prevalence of female UI varies widely across different studies, mostly ranging from 25-40%.&#xD;
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the most common type of UI. SUI is defined as&#xD;
      involuntary loss of urine when abdominal pressure increases suddenly such as coughing or&#xD;
      sneezing. SUI affects women's quality of life seriously, causing psychological problems such&#xD;
      as anxiety and depression, even socialization difficulties. There are many treatment options&#xD;
      for female SUI, including non-surgical and surgical interventions. Clinicians and patients&#xD;
      need a highly effective and low-risk therapy urgently, thus energy-based therapies were born&#xD;
      on demand. This study aims to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the fractional CO2 laser&#xD;
      in the treatment of female SUI, as well as its impact on women's quality of life.&#xD;

      Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common disease that refers to involuntary loss of urine. The&#xD;
      prevalence of female UI varies widely across different studies, mostly ranging from 25-40%.&#xD;
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the most common type of UI. SUI is defined as&#xD;
      involuntary loss of urine when abdominal pressure increases suddenly such as coughing or&#xD;
      sneezing. SUI affects women's quality of life seriously, causing psychological problems such&#xD;
      as anxiety and depression, even socialization difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many treatment options for female SUI, including non-surgical and surgical&#xD;
      interventions. For example, pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is the primary non-surgical&#xD;
      treatment method, requiring females to perform Kegel exercises consistently. PMFT has been&#xD;
      shown to be effective for female SUI, but the efficacy is dependent on the quality of PMFT.&#xD;
      Outpatient PFMT has a higher objective cure rate compared with home PFMT. Surgery is the most&#xD;
      effective treatment option, and the most common procedure is the mid-urethral sling (MUS).&#xD;
      Nevertheless, surgical risks such as persistent pain after surgery, bleeding, infection, and&#xD;
      urinary dysfunction cannot be ignored. Many outpatients are unable to persist in performing&#xD;
      high-quality PFMT and do not consent to surgical treatment. Clinicians and patients need a&#xD;
      highly effective and low-risk therapy urgently, thus energy-based therapies were born on&#xD;
      demand.The result of energy-based therapies including radiofrequency (RF), Erbium: YAG (Er:&#xD;
      YAG) laser, and CO2 laser is controversial, which has been reported in several papers. This&#xD;
      study aims to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the fractional CO2 laser in the&#xD;
      treatment of female SUI, as well as its impact on women's quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) contains 3 parts consisting of 21 items. The subscales in Part 1 and Part 2 scored from 0 to 100. The urinary symptoms scale in Part 3 is scored from 0 to 30. Every subscale and urinary symptoms scale calculate the score respectively and lower scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <description>Participants underwent three vaginal fractional CO2 laser (AcuPulse, Lumenis, Yokneam Illit, Israel) treatment sessions with 4-6 weeks intervals. The same laser device parameters (10 mJ, 10% density, spot diameter of 12Ã—12 mm2) were used in participants. A special laser probe was inserted into the patient's vagina after cleaning and disinfection. The laser procedure was performed at the 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 o'clock positions by rotating the laser probe from the proximal vagina to the distal, and additional procedures were performed at the 11 and 1 o'clock positions 5 mm above the introitus vaginae.</description>
