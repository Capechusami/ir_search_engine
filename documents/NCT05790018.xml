  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most special life events of the fertile period is pregnancy. Pregnancy causes many&#xD;
      physiological, metabolic, mental and social changes. These changes may adversely affect the&#xD;
      sleep quality and comfort levels of pregnant women. Sleep is one of the basic life&#xD;
      activities. Comfort is the state of being physiologically, mentally and socially comfortable.&#xD;
      The woman who completes her pregnancy comfortably has a high self-confidence and quality of&#xD;
      life. On the other hand, it is known that stress, anxiety and depression are experienced more&#xD;
      and pregnancy and birth complications increase. For this reason, it is important to determine&#xD;
      the comfort levels of pregnant women and to know the factors affecting them. It should not be&#xD;
      forgotten that sleep quality in the prenatal period may be effective on the comfort levels of&#xD;
      individuals. Evaluation of sleep quality and comfort levels of pregnant women is a routine&#xD;
      part of prenatal care. Various interventions can be used to improve the sleep quality of&#xD;
      pregnant women. The use of a pregnant pillow in the prenatal period is one of these&#xD;
      applications. By providing support and relaxation to 5 different parts of the body&#xD;
      simultaneously, the pregnancy pillow helps to increase the sleep quality of expectant mothers&#xD;
      during pregnancy and to reduce the neck, abdomen, waist, back and leg pains they experience.&#xD;
      It is known that sleep problems are experienced especially in primaries and third trimesters.&#xD;
      For this reason, using the pregnant pillow in the third trimester, when sleep problems&#xD;
      increase and comfort is adversely affected, may help improve the sleep quality and comfort&#xD;
      level of pregnant women. With this planned study, it was aimed to examine the effect of the&#xD;
      pregnant pillow used in the last trimester on sleep and comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be carried out with pregnant women who applied to Amasya University&#xD;
      Sabuncuoğlu Şerefeddin Training and Research Hospital NST and polyclinic unit between 01&#xD;
      March and 31 August 2023. The data of the study will be collected by using Personal&#xD;
      Information Form, Information Form on Sleep in Pregnancy, Prenatal Comfort Scale and Pitsburg&#xD;
      Sleep Quality Scale.&#xD;

      groups and homogeneity will be ensured in the distribution of the groups. &quot;Random Allocation&#xD;
      Software Program&quot; will be used in the randomization of pregnant women into groups and a&#xD;
      randomization list for the study will be created. If the pregnant woman leaves the study for&#xD;
      any reason during the study, the first pregnant woman who meets the research criteria will be&#xD;
      assigned to the other group in the randomization list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midwifery Initiative Midwifery Attempts Made to the Control Group The researcher will apply&#xD;

    <description>The comfort is one of the primary outcomes. The comfort levels of pregnant women will be measured using the Prenatal Comfort Scale (PCS).&#xD;
The PCS consists of 15 items and 5 sub-dimensions. The scale is evaluated over a total of 75 points. It is interpreted that as the score decreases, the comfort level also decreases, and as the score increases, the comfort level also increases.</description>

    <description>Sleep quality is the other primary outcome for this study. Sleep quality of pregnant women will be evaluated with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).&#xD;
The PSQI assesses sleep quality and disturbance over the past month. The scale consists of 7 components. Each component is evaluated over 0-3 points. The total score of the 7 components gives the scale total score. The total score ranges from 0 to 21. A total score greater than 5 indicates &quot;poor sleep quality&quot;.</description>
