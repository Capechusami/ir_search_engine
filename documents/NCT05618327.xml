  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK) profile, pharmacodynamic (PD) profile, immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy of JS203&#xD;
      in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The study is divided into&#xD;
      three phases: a dose-escalation phase, a dose-expansion phase, and an efficacy expansion&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;

             hepatitis C antibody and HCV RNA above the upper limit of the study center's normal&#xD;
             value.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. two or more malignancies within 5 years prior to the first dose. Except for early&#xD;
             malignancies that have been eradicated (carcinoma in situ or stage I tumors), such as&#xD;
             adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ, basal cell or squamous epithelial cell&#xD;
             skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. persons with uncontrollable psychiatric disorders&#xD;
&#xD;

             this study, including but not limited to having any disease or medical history that&#xD;
             may confound study results and interfere with patient compliance&#xD;
