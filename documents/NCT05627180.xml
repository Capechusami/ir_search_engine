  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health literacy refers to personal and relational factors affecting a persons ability to&#xD;
      aquire, understand and use health information and health services. In a need assessment&#xD;
      study, it was found that there is a need to focus on health literacy factors in the follow-up&#xD;
      of people with cancer in the health care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this project evaluate the effect of a health literacy intervention in cancer. The&#xD;
      intervention provides patients with nurse-led tailored follow-up by phone/digital/personal&#xD;
      meetings that addresses their individual HL needs, particularly those needs that impact their&#xD;
      quality of life, symptom burden, self-management, and health economic costs. Our main goal is&#xD;
      to improve the patients' health literacy, with secondary goals of improving their quality of&#xD;
      life, symptom burden, and self-management, and reducing their health care costs.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Tailored Health Literacy follow-up in cancer</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants are invited to a consultation with the project nurse where the project nurse will use baseline data to identify the patient's HL needs, QOL, symptom burden and issues related to self-management of their cancer and treatment. These data will be used together with an interview questionnaire specifically developed to communicate HL needs (i.e. CHAT), which form the basis for the individualized HL support.&#xD;
Actions: Based on results of the consultation, the project nurse and the patient will use a worksheet of possible actions to identify those most relevant to the patient's individual needs. Based on this, different self-management tasks and actions will be offered, and an individual tailored follow-up plan will be made. The patient and the project nurse will use a workbook containing information on the follow-up plan that will be added into medical record.&#xD;
Telephone/digital conversations with the project every second month for a period of 9 months.</description>
