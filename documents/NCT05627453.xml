  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AAGaTT study, is a monocentric, two-arm, open-label, randomized controlled trial. The&#xD;
      objective is to assess the efficacy of an arm-in-arm walking program for older people at risk&#xD;
      of falling. Gait training imply that the older participants must walk while synchronizing&#xD;
      steps with a younger partner.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A high level of physical activity is the cornerstone of healthy aging. Falls are a major&#xD;
      issue in elderly population, and exercising can mitigate their occurrence. However, the type&#xD;
      of exercise-and the optimal way to deliver it-that maximises efficacy is still unknown. The&#xD;
      ideal-most efficient-exercise intervention should have the following characteristics: it&#xD;
      should have a specific effect on fall risk mitigation, it should be of sufficient intensity&#xD;
      to improve cardiovascular fitness and muscle strength, it should be safe, it should not&#xD;
      induce high costs, and it should be sufficiently enjoyable and motivational to induce a high&#xD;
      adherence and compliance. The present trial aims at testing an innovative exercise&#xD;
      intervention that may exhibit all these advantages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will consist in four weeks of 30min arm-in-arm synchronized gait training&#xD;
      three times a week. Convincing evidence from the literature supports the use of rhythmic&#xD;
      externals cues, either auditory or visual, to improve the efficacy of gait training for fall&#xD;
      risk reduction in seniors. Synchronizing gait with a younger partner may bring further&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will focus on clinically relevant outcomes to highlight potential benefits of the&#xD;
      intervention in term of gait quality, balance, fall risk mitigation, physical activity level,&#xD;
      mood, and well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait quality will be assessed through two inertial sensors attached to the low back and foot.&#xD;
      Six gait assessement sessions are planned: at baseline (before randomization), at the end of&#xD;
      each training week, and at week 7 (follow-up). Participants will walk at their preferred&#xD;
      speed over 200m.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also include functional tests and self-filled questionnaires to evaluate&#xD;
      participant's abilities and mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Falls occuring within 18 months after inclusion will be tracked via an online questionnaire&#xD;
      every three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assess the superiority of arm-in-arm gait training compared to standard walking&#xD;
      (without gait synchronisation) via a randomized-controlled design. The perception of the&#xD;
      intervention by elderly participants will be explored via a qualitative analysis.&#xD;
