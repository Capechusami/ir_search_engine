  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Sulforaphane Production System® in Avmacol Extra Strength (ES) supplies broccoli seed&#xD;
      extract (glucoraphanin) and Myrosimax® (Active Myrosinase Enzyme) which helps promote&#xD;
      sulforaphane production in your body. The investigators hypothesize that daily intake of&#xD;
      Avmacol ES can decrease kidney disease progression rate and decrease markers of oxidative&#xD;
      stress and inflammation in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients. They will test this&#xD;
      hypothesis in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 clinical trial. This&#xD;
      proposed study has been funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney&#xD;
      Diseases (NIDDK), R01 DK128677.&#xD;

      The investigators will test the safety and efficacy of Avmacol ES in Chronic Kidney Disease&#xD;
      (CKD) patients. After having established a safe dose of 4 tablets once daily in participants&#xD;
      with CKD Stages 3 - 4 in the pharmacokinetic (PK) phase, the investigators will enroll 100&#xD;
      participants from the Kidney Clinic at the University of Rochester Medical Center and&#xD;
      Highland Hospital with CKD stages 3 - 4 who will be randomized to Avmacol ES or placebo in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio in a blinded manner.&#xD;

    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) Scale v1.2 - Global Health questionnaire. Scoring: The questionnaire has two scores: Physical Health (physical health, physical function, pain, and fatigue items) and Mental Health (quality of life, mental health, satisfaction with discretionary social activities, and emotional problem items). In all cases, a high score means more of domain. T scores for both Physical and Mental Health scales. In all cases, a high score means more of domain. For example, higher scores on physical functioning measure indicate better health.</description>

    <description>Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) Scale v1.0 - Gastrointestinal Belly Pain 5a questionnaire. The PROMIS GI measures use a T-score centered on the U.S. General Population. This means that a score of 50 represents the average of the general population (and that 10 represents the standard deviation). A higher PROMIS T-score represents more of the concept being measured. For negatively-worded concepts like belly pain, a T-score of 60 is one SD worse than average. By comparison, a gastrointestinal symptom T-score of 40 is one SD better than average.</description>
