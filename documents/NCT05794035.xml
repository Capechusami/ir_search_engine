  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) incidence as well as morbidity rates are high in older&#xD;
      patients. Surgery is the standard of care. About 5 to 10% of NMSC present high-risk&#xD;
      clinico-pathologic features that can increase risk of local recurrence (LR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) is often discussed regarding the risk of local recurrence.&#xD;
      Despite the lack of high level evidence, ART is indicated in patients according to&#xD;
      unfavorable prognostic factors. ART benefit is generally questioned in regard to the&#xD;
      potential degradation of the patient's quality of life (QoL). Currently there is no&#xD;
      prospective trial or recommendations that take into account geriatric patients' evaluation&#xD;
      and profiles during the management of NMSC. In addition, there is no data that could help to&#xD;
      define the subgroup of elderly patients who will benefit from ART in tumors with unfavorable&#xD;
      prognostic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of ART, multiple fractionation schedules are available, ranging from standard&#xD;
      fractionation (45-60Gy in 5-6 weeks) to the extreme hypofractionation (HF) delivering 16-18Gy&#xD;
      in one fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In routine practice, HF is mainly preferred in elderly patients for more convenience by&#xD;
      reducing the number of transports and increase health related quality of life (HRQoL).&#xD;
      However, there is no data on the fragility profiles of these patients, nor validating any HF&#xD;
      schedule in terms of efficacy, acute toxicity, cosmetic results, and impact on HRQoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the main ain objective is to evaluate the comparative efficacy of two modalities of&#xD;
      Radiotherapy over surgery alone on local tumor control in older patients with Non Melanoma&#xD;
      Skin Cancer (NMSC) In current practice, adjuvant radiotherapy is discussed regarding the risk&#xD;
      of local recurrence as determined by the existence (or not) of unfavorable prognostic&#xD;
      factors. The proposed study will include R0-high risk of CBC and CEC of the skin in elderly&#xD;
      patients. There is no risk regarding the design of the trial as the last will respond to two&#xD;
      important unknown questions regarding the utility of RT and its fractionation in this&#xD;
      population. Moreover, it is an excellent opportunity to collect prospectively geriatric&#xD;
      evaluation and HRQoL data that are lacking in the literature for skin cancers. No constraints&#xD;
      are seen neither in the design, nor in the potential recruitments.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) incidence as well as morbidity rates are high in older&#xD;
      patients. Surgery is the standard of care. About 5 to 10% of NMSC present high-risk&#xD;

      Adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) is often discussed regarding the risk of local recurrence.&#xD;
      Despite the lack of high level evidence, ART is indicated in patients according to&#xD;

      potential degradation of the patient's quality of life (QoL). Currently there is no&#xD;

      Hypothesis/Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the comparative efficacy of two modalities of Radiotherapy over surgery alone on&#xD;
      local tumor control in older patients with Non Melanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC) In current&#xD;
      practice, adjuvant radiotherapy is discussed regarding the risk of local recurrence as&#xD;
      determined by the existence (or not) of unfavorable prognostic factors. The proposed study&#xD;
      will include R0-high risk of CBC and CEC of the skin in elderly patients. There is no risk&#xD;
      regarding the design of the trial as the last will respond to two important unknown questions&#xD;
      regarding the utility of RT and its fractionation in this population. Moreover, it is an&#xD;
      excellent opportunity to collect prospectively geriatric evaluation and HRQoL data that are&#xD;
      lacking in the literature for skin cancers. No constraints are seen neither in the design,&#xD;
      nor in the potential recruitments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local tumor control at 3-year follow-up in a time-to-event analysis Method This is a&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized, open-labeled, comparative 3 arms phase III trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After inclusion of patient aged ≥ 70 years with performance status OMS 0-3 who had completed&#xD;
      surgery (R0) for SCC and BCC with at least one unfavorable prognostic factor, all patientsst&#xD;
      will have G8 score and a Geriatric Core Data Set (G CODE) evaluation. Performance of a&#xD;
      complete oncogeriatric evaluation and its modalities will be left to the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be randomized in 3 arms with stratification by center, time from surgery to&#xD;
      wound healing and perineural invasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: Surgery alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: Surgery + Moderate HF 45Gy in 15 fractions, 3 fractions per week over 5 weeks to&#xD;
           the operative bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm C: Surgery + Extreme HF : 30Gy in 5 fractions of 6Gy, 1 fraction per week, over 5&#xD;
           weeks to the operative bed.&#xD;
