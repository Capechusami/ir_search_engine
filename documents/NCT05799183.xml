    <intervention_model_description>This study is divided into two parts: pre-test and formal test. Each experiment will have two independent cohorts of subjects who will receive the treatment(SHR-1210 before process changes and SHR-1210 after process changes，respectively), and each cohort will be followed by 192 hours of blood sampling for pharmacokinetic assessments, with safety and tolerability.</intervention_model_description>
