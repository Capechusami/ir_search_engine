  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that the prevalence of dementia in France is 5% for people over 65 years of&#xD;
      age and that this increases to 18% for people over 75 years of age. Behavioral disorders are&#xD;
      frequent in patients with dementia and are the main cause of institutionalization,&#xD;
      representing up to 50% of cases. Dementia syndromes can be translated into behavioral and&#xD;
      psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), which are defined as perceptual, mood or&#xD;
      behavioral disorders. To date, there is no cure for dementia, but certain measures can be&#xD;
      taken to reduce symptoms. The HAS suggests that physical exercise would reduce BPSD and could&#xD;
      improve the ability to perform activities of daily living or slow down the cognitive decline&#xD;
      of this type of patient. Indeed, several articles have highlighted the benefits of physical&#xD;
      activity in demented patients. A meta-analysis has shown a significant decrease in BPSD via&#xD;
      the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score. Nevertheless, it is often observed that there is&#xD;
      a difficulty in adhering to the program in very elderly population groups. Dance is a&#xD;
      complete physical activity that integrates physical, cognitive and social elements. A&#xD;
      meta-analysis has shown that dance has a significant effect on global cognition but also on&#xD;
      neuroplasticity and physical functioning in patients with mental disorders. The music&#xD;
      component of dance also has an effect on the behavioral problems of demented patients,&#xD;
      stimulating language ability and social and emotional function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, at present, no study of good methodological quality has been able to demonstrate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of dance-based physical activity for the treatment of dementia symptoms. As a&#xD;
      result of these findings, the APAISE project was developed and should help slow the onset of&#xD;
      BPSD in patients with dementia.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint was the overall score on the validated Neuropsychiatric Inventory questionnaire, completed by the health care teams. This questionnaire will be done at inclusion (day 0) and after 4 months of dance therapy for the experimental group or usual care alone for the control group.This questionnaire allows to highlight behavioral disorders in patients suffering from dementia according to 10 behavioral domains and 2 neurovegetative variables (sleep and appetite).</description>
