  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a physical activity promotion intervention&#xD;
      focused on walking behavior. The intervention is delivered via mobile application in a sample&#xD;
      drawn from the healthy adult population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sample of sedentary adults will be invited to participate in a 30 days intervention&#xD;
      delivered via a mobile app to achieve the goal of 7,000 daily steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after the intervention, some crucial variables will be evaluated for the formation&#xD;
      of the intention to change behavior and for the transition from intention to action&#xD;
      (attitudes, subjective norms, self-efficacy, expectations related to change, risk perception,&#xD;
      social support, planning) to compare two models of behavioral change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention, messages will be sent daily, and the number of steps taken daily&#xD;
      will be monitored. The aim is to compare the effectiveness of two types of communication in&#xD;
      promoting a positive behavioral change: non-personalized communication centered on well-being&#xD;
      (non-tailored communication) vs. personalized communication based on the psychological&#xD;
      characteristics evaluated before the intervention (tailored communication). The physical&#xD;
      activity carried out over 30 days by the participants who will receive the messages (tailored&#xD;
      and non-tailored) will be compared with the physical activity carried out by participants who&#xD;
      will not receive any messages (control group).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity is assessed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ; Mannocci et al., 2010). The scale comprises seven items on Physical Activity providing information about time spent walking, moderate and vigorous intensity, and sedentary activity. The elements are structured to provide separate scores for walking, moderate and vigorous intensity activity, and a combined total score to describe the overall activity level. Data collected with IPAQ are reported as a continuous measure and reported as MET-median minutes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Walk behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Walk behavior is self-monitored daily. Each evening, participants receive a message and enter the number of steps taken in a specific app section based on the data reported on the smartwatch or the smartphone's native app. The mean number of steps at the intervention's beginning and the end is then calculated. These two measures are compared to verify whether a statistically significant increase in daily steps is observed over time.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to a healthy lifestyle: diet</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Regarding adherence to a healthy lifestyle, participants report the frequency of consumption of 17 different food types through a 7-point Likert scale. The items were taken from a survey of the National Institute of Statistics (https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/91926). We will classify each behavior as adequate (score = 1) or inadequate (score = 0), following international and national guidelines. We will add up the scores obtained for specific foods similar to the MedDietScore scale (Trichopoulou et al., 2003), in order to build a diet adequacy index for use in subsequent analyses. The higher the score, the higher the adherence to guidelines.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to a healthy lifestyle: alcohol consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants report the frequency of consumption of alcoholic beverages during the last month through a 6-point Likert scale (1 = almost every day; 6 = never). The higher the score, the higher the adherence to guidelines.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to a healthy lifestyle: smoking</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants report if they smoke, and the frequency of smoking through a 6-point Likert scale (1 = every day; 6 = never). The higher the score, the higher the adherence to guidelines.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to a healthy lifestyle: medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence is evaluated using the brief Italian version of the Morisky Green Levine Scale (MGLS), a questionnaire consisting of 4 questions with dichotomous answers (yes or no). Each behavior is classified as adequate (score = 1) or inadequate (score = 0). The item responses are added up. The higher the score, the higher the medication adherence. A total score of &lt;2 is indicative of poor adherence.</description>

    <measure>Predictors of behavioral change according to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991; Canfora et al., 2018): subjective norms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants indicate how significant others judge regular walking as important (subjective norms or the perceived social pressure concerning walking behavior). This variable is measured through five items on a 7-point Likert scale, where 1 = totally disagree, 7 = totally agree. The score is calculated as the mean of the five items' scores. The higher the score, the stronger the subjective norms.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to this arm receive a daily tailored message on the benefits of taking at least 7000 steps daily. Tailoring concerns change-related expectations, risk perception, planning, retention capacity, resilience, and coping skills and is based on the responses provided by participants at baseline evaluation.&#xD;
In addition, they receive a daily request to declare the number of steps taken (walking self-monitoring).In particular, every evening, the mobile application sends a message to the participants requesting to enter the number of steps taken during the day in a dedicated app section.</description>
