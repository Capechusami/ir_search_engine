  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Univentricular heart defects are among the most complex congenital malformations. The&#xD;
      treatment of these patients usually includes 3 operations and accompanying diagnostics, some&#xD;
      of which are invasive, within the first 3 to 4 years of life until the &quot;fontan circulation&quot;&#xD;
      is established. Unfortunately, the group of patients with a univentricular cardiac&#xD;
      malformation is also the group with the highest mortality rate until the Fontan circulation&#xD;
      is established. The expected mortality varies depending on the complexity of the underlying&#xD;
      intracardiac and extracardiac malformations and possible concomitant morbidity; According to&#xD;
      data from the National Quality Assurance in Germany, it is currently up to 30% in patients&#xD;
      with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. However, the treatment methods are well standardized&#xD;
      and there has been a clinical protocol in Erlangen since 2008 that includes diagnostic&#xD;
      examinations using cardiac catheterization (HKU) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRT), as&#xD;
      well as non-invasive, instrument-based diagnostics and targeted blood tests in a consistent&#xD;
      sequence before and after the operations regulates. The Erlangen protocol ends with the&#xD;
      cardiac MRT six months after the Fontan operation (syn: total cavopulmonary connection&#xD;
      [TCPC]). If MRT imaging is not possible (e.g. if a cardiac pacemaker is present) or if there&#xD;
      is a clinical indication (e.g. an obstruction noticeable on MRT or the presence of an&#xD;
      &quot;overflow with right-left shunt&quot;), HKU is performed in the first year after TCPC. These&#xD;
      examinations are used to depict hemodynamics, cardiac function, vascular development, and&#xD;
      lymphatic drainage disorders in order to evaluate the preoperative risk, adapt treatment&#xD;
      strategies to the individual, and identify complications at an early stage. This concept is&#xD;
      based on clinical experience and current scientific findings and has proven itself in&#xD;
      everyday clinical practice since its introduction for Erlangen-Fontan patients and has proven&#xD;
      to be very helpful for individualized treatment. After a successful Fontan operation, the&#xD;
      mortality risk in childhood is only low. In the long term, however, some of the patients&#xD;
      unfortunately suffer from Fontan-typical long-term complications with protein-loss&#xD;
      enteropathy having to be mentioned in particular, which is described in the literature with&#xD;
      an incidence of 3-14% and today still a 5-year incidence-has a mortality risk of 6-12%.&#xD;
