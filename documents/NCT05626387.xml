    <textblock>
      To our knowledge, there is no randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in the treatment of HP. We aim to perform a randomized study to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy and safety of a regimen consisting of MMF and prednisolone against a&#xD;
      regimen consisting of prednisolone alone for treating fibrotic HP. We hypothesize that the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with fibrotic HP with MMF and prednisolone will be more effective and&#xD;
      safer than treatment with prednisolone alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a complex immunologically-mediated interstitial lung&#xD;
      disease (ILD) resulting from sensitization to an inhaled antigen. It may be categorized into&#xD;
      acute (acute/subacute) or chronic forms based on the duration of disease or evidence of&#xD;
      chronicity on radiological or pathological findings. Lately, the American Thoracic Society&#xD;
      (ATS) Guidelines 2020 has endorsed a new classification of HP into non-fibrotic and fibrotic&#xD;
      types based on the absence or presence of signs of fibrosis on chest computed tomography (CT)&#xD;
      or histology. According to a survey study, about three-fourths of respiratory physicians&#xD;
      believe that fibrotic HP should be treated with glucocorticoids as the treatment of first&#xD;
      choice, which also reflects the practice in most centers worldwide. However, there is some&#xD;
      evidence that glucocorticoids may not be effective in the long-term treatment of fibrotic HP.&#xD;
      Also, glucocorticoids are associated with several adverse effects especially when used over a&#xD;
      long duration. Therefore, most experts recommend that glucocorticoids should be tapered to&#xD;
      the lowest possible dose after a trial of about three months in chronic/fibrotic HP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is characterized by an exaggerated T cell-mediated immune&#xD;
      inflammatory response (T-lymphocytic alveolitis) due to increased migration, local&#xD;
      proliferation, and decreased programmed cell death of lymphocytes. Mycophenolate mofetil&#xD;
      (MMF) is an immunosuppressive drug that acts by inhibiting the proliferation of T-lymphocytes&#xD;
      and suppressing the recruitment of lymphocytes and monocytes into the sites of inflammation.&#xD;
      Therefore, MMF is likely to be effective in the treatment of HP. There are only a few&#xD;
      retrospective studies on the efficacy of MMF in the treatment of HP. To our knowledge, there&#xD;
      is no randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of MMF in the treatment of HP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to perform a randomized study to assess the efficacy and safety of a regimen&#xD;
      consisting of MMF and prednisolone against a regimen consisting of prednisolone alone for&#xD;
      treating fibrotic HP. We hypothesize that the treatment of patients with fibrotic HP with MMF&#xD;
      and prednisolone will be more effective and safer than treatment with prednisolone alone.&#xD;
