  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess outpatient treatment patterns following&#xD;
      hospitalization for venous thromboembolism (VTE). VTE is a condition that occurs when blood&#xD;
      clot forms in the vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a retrospective study (assessments on events that have already occurred) of&#xD;
      healthcare claims from databases. The study sponsors will assess healthcare claim records of&#xD;
      patients treated with either apixaban or warfarin. Assessment includes treatment persistence,&#xD;
      switch, and stopping therapy, along with recurrent VTE and bleeding.&#xD;

        Patients who are hospitalized for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and treated with apixaban or&#xD;
        warfarin during the hospitalization. Patients will be identified through linkage of IQVIA's&#xD;
        hospital charge data master database (CDM) with outpatient professional fee medical claims&#xD;
        (Dx) and longitudinal prescription claims (LRx) databases during the period of July 2018&#xD;
