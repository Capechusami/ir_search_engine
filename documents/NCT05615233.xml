      The purpose of the proposed study is to preliminarily evaluate Technology-based information&#xD;
      and coaching/support program that is tailored for Asian American midlife women who are family&#xD;
      caregivers of patients living with Alzheimer's disease (TACAD) in improving health outcomes&#xD;

      The purpose of the proposed study is to preliminarily evaluate a technology-based program in&#xD;
      improving health outcomes of Asian American midlife women who are family caregivers of&#xD;
      persons living with Alzheimer's disease (AACA) and their care recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants of this randomized clinical trial will be 60 self-reported AACA aged 40 to&#xD;
      65 years old who identify as Chinese or Korean; are family caregivers of PLAD; can read and&#xD;
      write English, Mandarin Chinese or Korean; who reside in the U.S.; and have access to the&#xD;
      Internet through computers or mobile devices. Participants will be recruited through both&#xD;
      online and offline communities/groups for Asian Americans. The recruitment settings are&#xD;
      identified through both Internet searches and recommendations by research team members. When&#xD;
      potential participants of Phase 2 visit the project Web site (after receiving/reviewing a&#xD;
      study announcement), they will be asked to review the informed consent. When participants&#xD;
      click I agree to participate, they will have given their consent. No identity information,&#xD;
      including IP addresses, will be attached to any of the individual or group data. Therefore,&#xD;
      research participants will not be identifiable directly or through the identifying&#xD;
      information linked to subjects. Only research staff will have access to the data. Phase 2&#xD;
      study consists of two groups of research participants: (a) a control group who does not use&#xD;
      the technology-based program, but uses the information on Alzheimer's Disease and caregiving&#xD;
      by the Alzheimer's Association website; (b) an intervention group who uses the&#xD;
      technology-based program and the information by the Alzheimer's Association website. Both&#xD;
      groups will participate in the study for 3 months. During the research process, both groups&#xD;
      are asked to fill out the Internet survey questionnaire (through the REDCap system) at three&#xD;
      times (pre-test, post-1 moth, and post 3-months); if requested, paper-and-pencil&#xD;
      questionnaires will be provided/used, or research staff will assist in administering the&#xD;
      Internet surveys over the phone. Data will be collected only through the Internet survey, and&#xD;
      each survey takes about 20 to 30 minutes to complete. Only for the intervention group, weekly&#xD;
      group and individual coaching/support (max 1hr/week) by culturally matched bilingual&#xD;
      interventionists will be provided through the online forum and chatting functions on the&#xD;
      project website, phone calls, or text messages through ethnic-specific communication apps,&#xD;
      and the participants are asked to use the educational modules, virtual reality app, and&#xD;
      online resources that are available on the project website. The data collected through the&#xD;
      Internet surveys will be stored on the HIPAA compliant clouds maintained by Emory University.&#xD;
      All documentation related to the study will be also stored on the HIPAA compliant clouds&#xD;
      maintained by Emory University.&#xD;
