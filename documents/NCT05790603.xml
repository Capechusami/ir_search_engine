    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical trial is to compare the hemostatic effect of 2 hemostatic&#xD;
      devices with or without quantitative pressure on radial arteries after percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention. The main questions aims to answer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the hemostatic effect of the quantitative pressure hemostatic device after&#xD;
           percutaneous coronary intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the precise hemostasis pressure and hemostasis time of the radial artery after&#xD;
           percutaneous coronary intervention? Participants will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
           intervention group (IG) and control group (CG). The IG will use quantitative pressure&#xD;
           patent hemostasis, which will be subdivided into three groups: low pressure group,&#xD;
           medium pressure group and high pressure group. The CG will use the conventional radial&#xD;
           artery hemostatic device without pressure monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are hemostasis success and incidence of radial artery occlusion.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include time to hemostasis, rate of bleeding, hematoma, pain, hand&#xD;
      swelling, pseudoaneurysm, antebrachial osteofascial compartment syndrome and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation of the compressed side thumb.&#xD;

      The objective of this clinical trial is to compare the hemostatic effect of 2 hemostatic&#xD;
      devices with or without quantitative pressure on radial arteries after percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention. The main questions aims to answer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the hemostatic effect of the quantitative pressure hemostatic device after&#xD;
           percutaneous coronary intervention?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the precise hemostasis pressure and hemostasis time of the radial artery after&#xD;
           percutaneous coronary intervention? Participants will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
           intervention group (IG) and control group (CG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IG will use quantitative pressure patent hemostasis, which will be subdivided into three&#xD;
      groups: low pressure group, medium pressure group and high pressure group. The IG will use a&#xD;
      compression pressure of 120% ,125% or 130% of preoperative upper limb systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      after PCI for low, medium, or high pressure group . For the participants assigned to the IG,&#xD;
      we will use the quantitative pressure patent hemostasis after the percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention. After that, the hemostasis pressure is reduced in a certain gradient every hour&#xD;
      until the hemostasis is successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the participants assigned to the CG, we will use the hemostatic device (traditionally&#xD;
      used in Peking University First Hospital) after percutaneous coronary intervention, and then&#xD;
      release the tourniquet hourly based on traditional experience to reduce the hemostatic&#xD;
      pressure until the hemostasis is successful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all enrolled participants, we should record the complications such as bleeding, hematoma,&#xD;
      pain, oxygen saturation of compressed thumb and hand swelling in the patient immediately and&#xD;
      hourly after the operation. Radial artery occlusion and radial artery thrombosis were&#xD;
      confirmed by arterial ultrasound at 24 hours (ward) and postoperative day 30 (follow-up&#xD;
      clinic).&#xD;
