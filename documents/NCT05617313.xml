  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, non-randomized Phase II trial is designed to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of GT103 in combination with pembrolizumab in adult subjects with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory, metastatic NSCLC. The study will consist of a safety lead-in of 10-20 patients. A&#xD;
      total of 50 patients will be treated with the combination at the safest dose of GT103 as&#xD;
      determined in the safety lead-in. If 10 additional patients are enrolled to the dose level -1&#xD;
      then the maximum of 60 subjects may be accrued to this trial.&#xD;
