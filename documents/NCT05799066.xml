    <textblock>
      The goal of this prospective reliability study is to test the effectiveness of a commercially&#xD;
      available, off-the-shelf virtual reality head-mounted display (VR HMD) and machine learning&#xD;
      (ML) algorithms in detecting Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) in a group of subjects&#xD;
      with known RAPD and another group with no known RAPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the use of the VR HMD and ML to replace the standard of care swinging flashlight&#xD;
           test provide a more reliable and objective pupil measurement to detect RAPD?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Can RAPD be detected by the VR HMD and ML algorithms at an earlier stage than the&#xD;
           standard of care swinging light test?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to undergo the standard of care swinging flashlight test, have&#xD;
      their pupils manually measured, then have the test repeated using the VR HMD and ML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will compare the measurements taken manually, following the standard of care&#xD;
      swinging light test and those recorded by the VR HMD and ML to help answer the above&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;

      Purpose of the Study/Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this reliability study is to successfully develop a mechanism for&#xD;
      diagnostics of Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) using pupil measurement values and&#xD;
      pathologic response. The diagnostics of this test will later be compared with the traditional&#xD;
      swinging flashlight test results. The physiological basis of the study is that the reaction&#xD;
      of the pupils in the right and left eyes are linked. When a bright light is shone into one&#xD;
      eye, it will lead to an equal constriction of both pupils. When the light source is removed&#xD;
      from the eye, the pupils will enlarge equally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is difference between pupil measurement values of two eyes when the light&#xD;
      source moves from one eye to the other is an indicator of RAPD. This reliability study is to&#xD;
      use a commercially-available, off-the-shelf virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display (HMD)&#xD;
      and machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect RAPD at an earlier stage with small&#xD;
      differences in pupil measurement values. The RAPD is a critically important sign in patients&#xD;
      with unexplained visual loss because it is an objective finding of afferent pupillary&#xD;
      dysfunction. The research question is if the proposed use of VR and ML to replace the&#xD;
      swinging flashlight test provides a more reliable and objective pupil measurement to detect&#xD;
      RAPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      A relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) is a critically important ophthalmologic&#xD;
      examination finding that defines a defect (lesion) in the pupil pathway on the afferent side.&#xD;
      A RAPD is relative to the fellow eye and occurs because of the bilateral and equal&#xD;
      innervation of the pupils in normal individuals. The RAPD manifests as a difference in&#xD;
      pupillary light reaction between the two eyes. The test requires two eyes but only one&#xD;
      working pupil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a normal patient without afferent pupillary disease, shining a light in either eye will&#xD;
      produce constriction of both eyes equally. In the case of an afferent pupillary pathway&#xD;
      lesion, the light response is tested individually in each eye and then the light swings&#xD;
      between the two eyes to detect RAPD. The normal pupillary response is characterized by equal&#xD;
      constriction of the pupils in both eyes when the light stimulus is applied to each eye&#xD;
      individually and no dilation or pupillary escape when the light swings from the one eye to&#xD;
      the fellow eye. The pathologic response that characterizes the RAPD includes the following:&#xD;
      (1) the light reaction causes pupil constriction in both eyes when the light shines in the&#xD;
      normal eye, and (2) dilatation of the pupils in both eyes when the light stimulus is rapidly&#xD;
      transferred from the normal eye to the pathologic eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a reliability study evaluating the performance of the HTC Vive Pro Eye,&#xD;
      to detect RAPD. The HTC Vive Pro Eye is not an experimental device. It is a consumer-grade VR&#xD;
      HMD available as an off-the-shelf VR Headset. To validate the ability of the VR HMD to detect&#xD;
      RAPD in patients, a reliability study will be performed by using the device on patients with&#xD;
      known RAPD and patients without RAPD. Participants will undergo manual pupil measurement in&#xD;
      the eye clinic via penlight for direct and swinging light test reflexes. Patients then will&#xD;
      undergo the VR HMD eye measurements as discussed previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated total number of participants for this study is 120 patients aged 18 to 85,&#xD;
      consisting of 60 participants in the control group (no known RAPD) and 60 participants in the&#xD;
      experimental group (known RAPD). Both groups will undergo the traditional swinging flashlight&#xD;
      test and testing with the VR HMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Records will be used to obtain ocular imaging, pupil measurements, past medical&#xD;
      history and past ocular history. Demographic information will be obtained through a&#xD;
      self-reporting survey for age, gender and ethnicity. Data will be acquired by using the VR&#xD;
      HMD. The protocol presents light through the VR HMD displays to each eye individually and&#xD;
      will use participants' pupil diameters via its integrated eye tracking cameras to collect&#xD;
      information about pupillary reflex deficit. Data from visual function tests such as visual&#xD;
      acuity, visual field, chromatic sensitivity, etiology of RAPD etc. will be taken from the&#xD;
      EPIC electronic medical record (EMR) to compare with current study findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will include records of participants' voices or images. Video of the pupils of&#xD;
      the participant and their gaze location may be recorded via VR device for research purpose.&#xD;
      Audio, video or photographs may be recorded for publication purposes. Subject identity will&#xD;
      be removed from the audio, video and photographs. Informed Consent Form will ask the subject&#xD;
      for their permission to be photographed or audio/video recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal Investigator (PI) and researchers will ensure that all study personnel are informed&#xD;
      about the research plan and their research-related duties by routine meetings, regular&#xD;
      communication via email and phone. All researchers will take the human subject protection&#xD;
      training sanctioned by the university via CITI Program training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A counterbalanced repeated measures experimental design will be used to compare participant&#xD;
      performance in two conditions: using traditional swinging flashlight test versus using pupil&#xD;
      measurement head-mounted display. The independent variable in the study will be modes (2&#xD;
      conditions) and the measured dependent variables (1 condition) will be RAPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intervention that is being evaluated is whether virtual reality testing through a&#xD;
      VR HMD device can adequately diagnose RAPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will undergo the standard of care swinging flashlight test to diagnose RAPD&#xD;
      by their treating ophthalmologist, an IRB approved study team member, at their regular clinic&#xD;
      visit, prior to participation in the study. If the patient elects to participate in the&#xD;
      study, participates in the consent process and signs the Informed Consent Form, he or she&#xD;
      will undergo a repeat of the standard of care swinging flashlight test, then participant will&#xD;
      undergo testing with the VR HMD. Data on each participant's pupil sizes in both light and&#xD;
      dark simulations is measured and coded. The VR HMD pupil measurement device is a&#xD;
      consumer-grade virtual reality headset available as an off-the-shelf gaming product. The risk&#xD;
      of using the device is minimal and no greater than the standard of care swinging flashlight&#xD;
      test. The device uses illumination of less than 90 cd/m2 which is below and in accordance&#xD;
      with the typical flashlight exposure of 100 cd/m2. There is therefore no disproportionate&#xD;
      increase in risk. The device's maximum illumination is well below the threshold which would&#xD;
      be of potential risk of harm. Risk of loss of private health information (PHI) is minimized&#xD;
      by the manner with which the data will be stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the acquisition time, subjects will be assigned a study identification number. That number&#xD;
      will be recorded on a subject identity master key, along with the subject's medical record&#xD;
      number (MRN). Once the subject identity master key has been created and stored separately&#xD;
      from study data in a password protected file on UTMB's secure server behind a firewall. All&#xD;
      identifying information will then be removed from the subject's data. The deidentified data&#xD;
      will then be stored in a secure folder on the UTMB secure server behind a firewall and that&#xD;
      of the collaborating site (University of Nevada, Reno) computer behind a firewall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total testing should take approximately 10-30 minutes. After each participant has their&#xD;
      standard of care ophthalmology visit with their treating ophthalmologist, an Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board- (IRB-) approved study team member, consent will be obtained by an IRB-approved&#xD;
      study team member, who has been properly trained and designated by the PI to obtain consent.&#xD;
      If the patient consents, they will undergo a repeat of the swinging light test and their&#xD;
      pupil measurements recorded manually. Then the subject will undergo testing with the VR HMD&#xD;
      during which the device will take pupillary measurements lasting approximately five minutes.&#xD;
      No follow-up appointments for research purposes are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from the UTMB eye clinic. Subjects' participation is limited to&#xD;
      one visit. Study enrollment is anticipated to take six months. The duration of the study is&#xD;
      estimated to be two years.&#xD;
