  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shock is a serious complication corresponding to acute circulatory failure resulting in&#xD;
      multiorgan failure and death. In order to improve cellular oxygen utilization, several&#xD;
      therapies can be used. To select one of them, the monitoring of cardiac output is helpful.&#xD;
      However, there are several methods used in current practice in intensive care for evaluating&#xD;
      hemodynamic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, in patients with acute circulatory failure, no study has compared the concordance&#xD;
      of therapeutic decision-making based on transpulmonary thermodilution or transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the PICC-ECHO study is thus to assess the concordance of therapeutic&#xD;
      decision-making by several experts, based on data from transpulmonary thermodilution or&#xD;
      transthoracic echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, the investigators hypothesize that performing hemodynamic monitoring based on&#xD;
      transpulmonary thermodilution or transthoracic echocardiography does not lead to the same&#xD;
      therapeutic management in patients in shock.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PICC-ECHO is a monocentric, prospective, non interventional, exploratory study to assess the&#xD;
      concordance of therapeutic decision-making between two strategies used in current practice,&#xD;
      transthoracic echocardiography and transpulmonary thermodilution, in patients with acute&#xD;
      circulatory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient in shock with cardiac output monitoring by transpulmonary thermodilution is&#xD;
      identified and then eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After inclusion, measurements of cardiac output with PICCO device and transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography will be performed before and after a passive leg raising test and a&#xD;
      respiratory occlusion test if patient are under invasive mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These assessments will be conducted by two different investigators, to be sure that data by&#xD;
      transthoracic echocardiography will not be influenced by the measurements collected by the&#xD;
      analysis of the transpulmonary thermodilution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical, biological, echocardiographic and transpulmonary thermodilution data will be then&#xD;
      collected on a database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic management of the clinicianresponsible for the patient will also be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database will be used as support for the drafting of three medical observations for each&#xD;
      patient on an electronic CRF : one with data from transpulmonary thermodilution, one with&#xD;
      data from transthoracic echocardiography, and one with only clinico-biological parameters&#xD;
      (without advanced monitoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end, 45 different files will be compiled and submitted to different intensive care&#xD;
      physicians (between 10 and 20) working outside the investigative team (&quot; experts &quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to avoid any recognition between the three versions of a same patient, the&#xD;
      investigators will undergo a semantic variation and the mailings will be done in three&#xD;
      distinct groups corresponding to the three methods separated by a few weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each clinical case, experts will have to choose about the following choices: volume&#xD;
      expansion, increase norepinephrine, introduction or increase dobutamine, abstention with&#xD;
      continuation of current therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital status of the patient as well as the use of supportive care (mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      renal-replacement therapy, vasoactive drug, other assistance) and their duration will be&#xD;
      collected at day nÂ°28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each case, the investigators will evaluate the concordance of decision of each expert,&#xD;
      depending on whether the informations was collected by PICCO device, by echocardiography or&#xD;
      without invasive monitoring.&#xD;
