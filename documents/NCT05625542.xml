  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vifor International Ltd. is seeking real-world evidence (RWE) to better understand the&#xD;
      epidemiology, patient characteristics, and management of CKD-aP in the real-world clinical&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CKD-aP is a global clinical problem, and finding effective treatment remains a therapeutic&#xD;
      challenge because of its complex pathophysiology (Sommer 2007, Weisshaar 2019, Yosipovitch&#xD;
      2013). The association between CKD-aP and clinical features and laboratory data remains&#xD;
      unclear (Davison 2021, Manenti 2021). CKD-aP is thought to be associated with several&#xD;
      conditions, including vitamin D deficiency, metabolic abnormalities (e.g., abnormal serum&#xD;
      calcium or phosphate levels), toxin build-up, peripheral neuropathy, immune system&#xD;
      dysregulation, or opioid receptor dysregulation (Jung 2015, Xie 2021, Kremer 2019, Verduzco&#xD;
      2020, Swarna 2019, Manenti 2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there is no systematic assessment of CKD-aP in routine clinical practice, and the&#xD;
      prevalence of CKD-aP is generally under-reported by patients and therefore underestimated by&#xD;
      as much as 69% of healthcare professionals (HCPs) (Rayner 2017). Alleviating the burden of&#xD;
      CKD-aP requires proactive identification of patients who suffer from it (Sukul 2020, Davison&#xD;
      2015, Phan 2012).&#xD;
