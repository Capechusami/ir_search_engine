      This study aims to evaluate Effectiveness of Investigational Device, Lunit INSIGHT MMG, in&#xD;
      the assistance of Detection and Diagnosis of Breast Cancer during Screening Mammography&#xD;
      Interpretation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Lunit INSIGHT MMG is developed as a computer-assisted detection/diagnosis device based on&#xD;
      deep learning technology. In this pivotal study, effectiveness of the investigational device,&#xD;
      Lunit INSIGHT MMG, was examined by comparing the reading panelist's interpretation ability&#xD;
      between CAD assisted and unassisted during screening mammography interpretation.&#xD;
