  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this micro-randomized trial is to evaluate the effects of 7 types of&#xD;
      intervention messages targeting specific behavior change techniques (i.e., BCT messages)&#xD;
      delivered in &quot;just-in-time&quot; (JIT) moments on daily achievement of weight-related behavioral&#xD;
      goals among n=201 young adults with overweight and obesity, participating in a digital,&#xD;
      mobile comprehensive lifestyle intervention. &quot;Just-in-time adaptive interventions&quot; (JITAIs)&#xD;
      are an alternative to the &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach of mobile intervention development&#xD;
      that can provide tailored, real-time messaging and support for young adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 1 in 2 US adults will have obesity by 2030, which is a major cause of morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. The highest risk of weight gain is among young adults ages 18-35 years.&#xD;
      In-person behavioral interventions generally produce clinically significant weight losses,&#xD;
      but cost and reduced reach limit their ability to impact obesity at a population level.&#xD;
      Web-based interventions that mimic the structure of weekly face-to-face treatment have proven&#xD;
      a viable alternative, though weight losses are generally smaller than in-person treatment.&#xD;
      Mobile treatments have the potential for high reach, but have been less effective, producing&#xD;
      1-3 kgs over 6 months. Newer digital intervention approaches called &quot;just-in-time adaptive&#xD;
      interventions&quot; (JITAIs) promise to improve upon mobile outcomes by offering adaptive,&#xD;
      personalized feedback on behavior, which consists of providing the &quot;right type of support&quot; at&#xD;
      &quot;the right time&quot; rather than on a fixed schedule. This &quot;just-in- time,&quot; or JIT, approach is&#xD;
      made possible by the emergence of low-cost and widely available digital health tools that&#xD;
      allow for the collection of continually updated health data. However, to date, no JITAIs have&#xD;
      successfully targeted multiple weight-related behaviors (weighing, activity, and diet), and&#xD;
      there has been no systematic examination of what types of messaging interventions best&#xD;
      promote adherence to these three weight loss behaviors, for whom they are effective, and&#xD;
      under what conditions. To address this problem, a micro-randomized trial will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of 7 types of intervention messages targeting specific behavior change&#xD;
      techniques (i.e., BCT messages) delivered in JIT moments on daily achievement of behavioral&#xD;
      goals among n=201 young adults with overweight and obesity. All participants will receive a&#xD;
      6-month behavioral weight loss intervention using our Nudge mobile app, which includes&#xD;
      evidence-based weekly lessons, tailored feedback, self-monitoring, and daily BCT messages.&#xD;
      Participants will receive a wireless scale, activity tracker, and track &quot;red&quot; foods&#xD;
      (high-calorie foods) in the app and have 3 goals: weigh daily, a daily active minutes goal&#xD;
      that gradually increases if met, and a daily red foods limit. At 3 decision points per day,&#xD;
      participants will be micro-randomized to receive or not receive 1 of 7 types of BCT messages.&#xD;
      Each intervention message has unique decision rules for availability. Candidate intervention&#xD;
      message options have been carefully selected from empirical evidence, tested in our prior&#xD;
      studies, or are from our pilot micro-randomized trial. Assessments will occur daily, and at&#xD;
      0, 3 and 6 months, to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Evaluate the effects of each&#xD;
      behavior change technique message (i.e., BCT message) on daily adherence to weight loss&#xD;
      behaviors; 2) Determine whether the effects of BCT messages on proximal outcomes change over&#xD;
      time; and 3) Assess whether the effects of BCT messages on proximal outcomes are moderated by&#xD;
      participants' contextual factors. Findings will guide how adaptive, behaviorally- and&#xD;
      contextually-dependent messages are incorporated into future JITAIs for weight loss.&#xD;
