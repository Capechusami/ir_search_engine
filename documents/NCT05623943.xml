  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational study is to explore the ability of intravascular pressure&#xD;
      gradients to identify hemodynamic disturbance in patients with intracranial atherosclerotic&#xD;
      diseases (ICAS). The main questions that aim to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The correlation between intravascular pressure gradient and cerebral blood flow (CBF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The threshold for intravascular pressure gradients to predict hemodynamic disturbance in&#xD;
           ICAS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo intravascular pressure measurement and arterial spin labeling (ASL) for&#xD;
      CBF during pre- and post-operation respectively.&#xD;

    <measure>The relevance between intravascular pressure gradients and CBF</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-operation, an average of 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be divided into 2 groups according to whether they have hemodynamic disorders before operation and improve after operation. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement will be analyzed in each group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The difference of ASL-CBF between pre- and post-operation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-operation, an average of 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The mean cerebral blood flow (CBF) of ipsilateral region of interest (ROI) in two different layers will be recorded as CBF in MCA perfusion area of this side. Relative CBF (rCBF) is defined as the ratio of the affected side CBF to the contralateral CBF. When preoperative rCBF&lt;0.9 and postoperative rCBF≥0.9, the patient will be considered to have hemodynamic disorders and be improved post-operation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The difference of FFR between pre- and post-operation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-operation, an average of 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>FFR measurement will be performed at rest by 0.014-inch pressure guide wires (C12008, Abbot St. Jude Medical, Minneapolis, MN, USA) designed for coronary diseases. The mean endovascular pressure of distal and proximal lesions will be measured and recorded as Pd and Pa, respectively. Pd/Pa and Pa-Pd will be calculated and recorded before and after endovascular treatment.</description>
