      The purpose of the SMART-EXAM (SMart Angioplasty Research Team-Pragmatic Randomized Trial for&#xD;
      Comparing Routine versus As-Needed EXercise or Pharmacologic Stress Testing in Asymptomatic&#xD;
      Patients with High-Risk Coronary CalciuM) trial is to compare the major adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events between routine stress testing and as-needed stress testing in&#xD;
      asymptomatic patients with high-risk coronary calcium (Agatston Score ≥ 400) without proven&#xD;
      ASCVD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The coronary artery calcium (CAC) scan, a marker of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis, has&#xD;
      become popular for individuals at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. CAC is&#xD;
      strongly associated with atherosclerotic burden and predicts coronary heart disease events&#xD;
      and mortality, regardless of their age, sex, race, or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      (ASCVD) risk. Furthermore, the progression of CAC is associated with an increased risk for&#xD;
      future hard and total coronary heart disease events. The use of CAC scoring was associated&#xD;
      with significant improvements in the reclassification and discrimination of incident ASCVD.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the current guidelines recommend CAC measurement for selected cases only with&#xD;
      borderline or intermediate risk of ASCVD. However, in real-world practice, CAC testing is&#xD;
      increasingly being promoted to the public as a means of self-assessment of cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk and is widely being used regardless of ASCVD risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive stress testing is often recommended to exclude potentially dangerous coronary&#xD;
      artery disease. However, stress testing in asymptomatic individuals has low sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity.9 Although the 2019 Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Guidelines do&#xD;
      not comment on functional or invasive testing in asymptomatic individuals with a high CAC&#xD;
      score, the 2009 Appropriate Use Criteria for Cardiac Radionuclide Imaging report gives a&#xD;
      level A recommendation for obtaining a stress test in asymptomatic individuals with CAC score&#xD;
      ≥400.10 In addition, the 2013 update of the 2009 document also considers stress imaging&#xD;
      appropriate for patients with CAC score &gt;100. However, there have been no large randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials or observational studies that have evaluated the utility of functional or&#xD;
      invasive testing in asymptomatic individuals free of ASCVD with high CAC scores.&#xD;
      Theoretically, early detection and revascularization of ischemia producing lesions in&#xD;
      asymptomatic patients with high-risk coronary calcification without proven ASCVD might reduce&#xD;
      the future risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.&#xD;
