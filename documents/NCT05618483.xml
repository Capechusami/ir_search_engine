      Xlear have developed and patented a xylitol containing nasal spray for the treatment of&#xD;
      upper-respiratory tract infections. The nasal spray is comprised of xylitol and GSE&#xD;
      (Grapefruit Seed extract) which provides antibacterial properties as well as preventing viral&#xD;
      adhesion in the nasal passage. Studies into Xlear's antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2 are&#xD;
      currently ongoing but hypothetically, a Xylitol Based Nasal spray may prove to be a useful&#xD;
      and inexpensive treatment for COVID-19 infection.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND and RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the wake of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, worldwide healthcare has&#xD;
      rapidly evolved in response. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is&#xD;
      a novel virus responsible for COVID-19, which at the most severe end of the spectrum of&#xD;
      disease can require hospitalisation or ICU admission. Preventative measures are currently&#xD;
      being taken with numerous vaccination programs across the world. However, there is currently&#xD;
      no established treatment for mild COVID-19 infection, i.e., symptomatic infection not&#xD;
      requiring hospitalisation, which makes up a significant proportion of cases. Xylitol has&#xD;
      shown promising results in combating SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and this study aims to explore&#xD;
      whether Xlear's Xylitol based Nasal Spray has an effect in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 COVID-19 Infection SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense, single-strand RNA virus comprised of&#xD;
      four structural proteins: Nucleocapsid (N) protein, Membrane (M) protein, Spike (S) protein&#xD;
      and Envelope (E) protein. These structural proteins play an important role in receptor&#xD;
      binding, transcription, replication and assembly of the virus in host cells (Boopathi et al.,&#xD;
      2020). The nasal epithelium acts as the primary site for SARS-CoV-2 binding to angiotensin&#xD;
      converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) - the receptor responsible for COVID-19 infection (Zhou et al.,&#xD;
      2020). With nasal carriage playing a vital role in transmission, drugs administered&#xD;
      intranasally could be a viable therapeutic option (Sungnak et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Drug: Xylitol Xylitol is a sugar alcohol derived from plants. It is used in the dental&#xD;
      profession to prevent plaque build-up and inhibit enamel demineralisation by interfering with&#xD;
      the metabolism of Streptococcus mutans, causing cell death and thus preventing dental caries&#xD;
      (Janakiram et al., 2017). Xylitol not only demonstrates antimicrobial behaviour but can also&#xD;
      modulate immunity and contribute to wound healing (Salli et al., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2.1 Xylitol and Respiratory Tract Infections Xylitol's inhibitory effect on Streptococcus&#xD;
      mutans growth has prompted more research into its interactions with other nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      pathogens responsible for respiratory tract infections. An in vitro study into&#xD;
      alpha-haemolytic Streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-haemolytic Streptococci treated with 1%&#xD;
      and 5% xylitol showed statistically significant inhibition of growth over a 24-hour&#xD;
      incubation period (Kontiokari et al., 1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another team established xylitol's ability to kill coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. 5%&#xD;
      xylitol administered to 21 participants compared to a control group using a saline solution&#xD;
      showed a significant decrease in Staphylococcus count from 597 colony forming units (CFU) per&#xD;
      swab to 99 CFU per swab (Zabner et al., 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2.2 Xylitol and Viruses Xylitol's inhibitory effects on bacteria are well documented but&#xD;
      little is known regarding its antiviral properties. Dietary xylitol was used to treat&#xD;
      influenza A virus in vivo. Mice given a combination of xylitol and red ginseng had 100%&#xD;
      survival rate at 33mg/kg/day of xylitol and 60% survival rate at 3.3mg/kg/day after day 14 of&#xD;
      infection versus 0% survival rate on PBS (control), red ginseng and xylitol separately. This&#xD;
      suggests a synergistic effect between xylitol and red ginseng (Yin et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study into xylitol and its interactions with human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) was&#xD;
      conducted in 2015. Xylitol was tested in vitro on a hRSV suspension and in vivo in mice. The&#xD;
      in vitro effect of xylitol showed complete inhibition at concentrations of 3.13mg/ml. Xylitol&#xD;
      significantly reduced lung viral titres in mice with 3.3mg/kg/d proving the most effective&#xD;
      dose (Xu et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Grapefruit Seed Extract (GSE) Grapefruit seed extract (GSE) is made from grapefruit&#xD;
      seeds. It is used as a natural remedy due to its antioxidant and antimicrobial properties&#xD;
      (Reagor et al., 2002; Salehi et al., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3.1 GSE and Viruses GSE was tested on multiple viruses to determine if it had any&#xD;
      inhibitory effects. GSE exhibited virucidal activity against avian influenza virus (AIV) and&#xD;
      Newcastle disease virus (NDV) but not against infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) (Komura&#xD;
      et al., 2019). These findings may be important as AIV and NDV are enveloped viruses like&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 whilst IBDV is not (Schoeman et al., 2019). It could be hypothesised that GSE&#xD;
      could exhibit similar inhibition on SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Xlear's Xylitol based Nasal Spray Xlear have developed and patented a xylitol containing&#xD;
      nasal spray for the treatment of upper-respiratory tract infections. The nasal spray is&#xD;
      comprised of xylitol and GSE which provides antibacterial properties as well as preventing&#xD;
      viral adhesion in the nasal passage. Studies into Xlear's antiviral effects on SARS-CoV-2 are&#xD;
      currently ongoing but hypothetically, a Xylitol Based Nasal spray may prove to be a useful&#xD;
      and inexpensive treatment for COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4.1 Xlear and Coronavirus Xylitol has been shown to exhibit antiviral properties against&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Bansal et al., 2021; Ferrer et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      USA-WAI/2020 strain was prepared and passaged in Vero 76 cells for testing with Xlear&#xD;
      (experiment 2) and its components xylitol and GSE separately (experiment 1). GSE 0.2% reduced&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 from 3.67 log10 CCID50/0.1 mL to undetectable in experiment 1. Xlear in virucidal&#xD;
      assays completely inhibited viral infectively at varying concentrations (90%, 80%, 50%) and&#xD;
      reduced viral titre by 2.17 log in 20% concentration indicating a dose-dependent response&#xD;
      (Appendix 1) (Ferrer et al., 2020). A subsequent study showed statistically significant&#xD;
      reduction in viral titres treated with Xlear nasal spray treatment - 4.2 log10 CCID50/0.1mL&#xD;
      to 1.7, a reduction of 2.5 log10 CCID50 (Cannon et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent private report by Dr Cagno's team in Lausanne (April 2021) has confirmed the viral&#xD;
      killing properties of Xlear in 2021 SARS-CoV-2 strains. Viral stocks were grown in Vero E6&#xD;
      cells belonging to two lineages, B1.1.7 and B1.351. Complete inhibition of viral infectivity&#xD;
      was observed in 90%, 60% and 20% concentration Xlear virucidal assays for B1.351. Viral&#xD;
      infectivity was similarly completely inhibited in B1.17 at 90% and 60% concentration with a&#xD;
      3.06 log reduction at 20% illustrated in Appendix 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A case study was conducted on individuals who had taken Xlear as treatment for COVID-19&#xD;
      infection. Participants were required to spray into each nostril four times per day (140 ÂµL&#xD;
      per spray). All individuals showed improvement in symptoms with quicker turnarounds from&#xD;
      turning positive to negative via COVID-19 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      (RT-PCR) nasal swabs. Importantly, some individuals had relevant co-morbidities such as&#xD;
      current smoking status and obesity. Although it is difficult to attribute symptom improvement&#xD;
      and viral load decrease to Xlear's spray, it does provide rationale for a double-blind&#xD;
      placebo controlled randomised clinical trial (Go et al., 2020).&#xD;
