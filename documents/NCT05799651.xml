  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glycovax Pharma has developed a glycoconjugate vaccine candidate called Glycovax-002 to fight&#xD;
      the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the origin of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      Glycovax-002 in humans. The study is a phase I, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study&#xD;
      conducted in 36 healthy females and males aged between 18 and 55 years old. The vaccine will&#xD;
      be administered three times with a two-week time interval between each dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation is conducted in three steps. At each step, 9 participants receiving the&#xD;
      vaccine will be randomized with 3 participants receiving placebo (normal saline). Progression&#xD;
      to next step is conditional to a DSMB's approval.&#xD;
