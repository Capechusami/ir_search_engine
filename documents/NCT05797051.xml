  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Morning urine samples of patients with IgA nephropathy, idiopathic membranous nephropathy,&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy, and minimal degenerative nephropathy confirmed by renal needle biopsy&#xD;
      in our hospital from November 2020 to January 2022 were collected. By scanning the morning&#xD;
      urine samples of corresponding patients with microhyperspectral imager, machine learning and&#xD;
      deep learning were used to classify microhyperspectral images, and the classification&#xD;
      accuracy was greater than 85%. Thus, hyperspectral imaging technology could be used as a&#xD;
      non-invasive diagnostic means to assist the diagnosis of glomerular diseases.&#xD;

    <description>Urine samples were collected from patients with IgA nephropathy, idiopathic membranous nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy and minimal change nephropathy. The samples were centrifuged and frozen in a refrigerator at -80 degrees Celsius. The images were divided into a training set and a test set at a fixed ratio. The digital images were input into classification models such as one-dimensional convolutional neural network to learn and test. The training set was used for the training and parameter iteration of the artificial intelligence non-invasive fluid diagnosis model, and the test set was used for the recognition and interpretation of the model. The confusion matrix, accuracy and ROC curve were calculated through the interpretation results to evaluate the performance of the model.</description>
