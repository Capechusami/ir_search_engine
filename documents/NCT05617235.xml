      Effective pain control after thoracotomy increases the patient's respiratory functions and&#xD;
      related quality of life, reduces the length of hospital stay and the amount of analgesia use.&#xD;
      Kinesiology taping has been used in sports injuries for many years and has been used in&#xD;
      recent years to reduce pain after major surgery. This study was conducted to examine the&#xD;
      effect of kinesiology taping on pain, respiratory function and respiratory muscle strength in&#xD;
      patients who underwent thoracotomy.In this prospective randomized controlled experimental&#xD;
      study, individuals between the ages of 20-75 who underwent thoracotomy with posterolateral&#xD;
      thoracotomy and who agreed to participate in the study were included. Unlike the control&#xD;
      group, kinesiology taping was applied to the study group for 7 days after surgery. Pain,&#xD;
      respiratory functions, respiratory muscle strength, amount of analgesic drug use, and quality&#xD;
      of life were evaluated preoperatively, postoperative day 0, before tape application,&#xD;
      postoperative 1st day, postoperative 2nd day, postoperative 7th day and postoperative 1st&#xD;
      month.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are few studies showing the efficacy of kinesio taping for alleviating postoperative&#xD;
      pain. Kinesio taping reduces postoperative pain, functional activity impairment, analgesic&#xD;
      drug use, and lymphedema. Kinesio taping can improve cough reflex, secretion excretion,&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle strength and respiratory function.Kinesio taping has been used in sports&#xD;
      injuries for many years and has been used in recent years to reduce pain after major surgery.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine the effect of kinesio taping on pain, respiratory&#xD;
      function and respiratory muscle strength after thoracotomy.This study was conducted on&#xD;
      patients who underwent posterolateral thoracotomy. Written informed consent was obtained from&#xD;
      each patient. The study protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee. The&#xD;
      study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned to 1:1 Kinesio taping group or control group using a&#xD;
      computerized random number generator (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California) on&#xD;
      postoperative day 0.The first group of the study consisted of patients in the Kinesio taping&#xD;
      group, who underwent kinesio taping in addition to postoperative pulmonary rehabilitation and&#xD;
      standard pain medication applications, and the second group consisted of patients in the&#xD;
      control group, who underwent postoperative pulmonary rehabilitation and standard pain&#xD;
      medication applications. On the postoperative 0th day, kinesiology taping was applied to the&#xD;
      patients in the Kinesio taping group whose hemodynamic status was stable after extubation by&#xD;
      an expert physiotherapist. The material we used for kinesio taping was Kinesio® Tex Gold™&#xD;
      (Kinesio Holding Corporation, Albuquerque, NM, USA), a 100% cotton, latex-free, 5 cm wide&#xD;
      elastic band. A The kinesio tape can stay for 3-4 days if the patient does not develop any&#xD;
      discomfort. After 3-4 days, the tape was renewed. The bands were removed at 1 week&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were followed from the preoperative period until discharge. For each patient,&#xD;
      age, gender, weight and height measurements, educational status, type of surgery, whether&#xD;
      there is any additional systemic disease, smoking, alcohol habits, medications they&#xD;
      constantly use, previous operations, postoperative complications, surgical procedure,&#xD;
      duration of operation, duration of anesthesia, Chest tube incision time and hospital stay&#xD;
      were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The G*power sample size calculator was used to determine the sample size of the study. A&#xD;
      sample size of 35 subjects for each group was estimated, assuming sample size, 0.05 type I&#xD;
      error rate (α) and 90% power (1-α). A total of 88 patients were included to avoid possible&#xD;
      loss or exclusion. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 23 statistical&#xD;
      software program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). In the comparisons between the two groups,&#xD;
      Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test was used. Chi-square test (Fisher exact test,&#xD;
      2-tailed) was used to compare categorical variables. Two-way analysis of variance was used in&#xD;
      repeated measures to evaluate the change over time of the measured variables of the treatment&#xD;
      and control groups and the group-time interactions.&#xD;

    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used as a one-dimensional scale for pain assessment. VAS is a self-administered, one-dimensional measure of pain intensity widely used in various adult populations. The VAS is a 10 cm long line in which participants mark the point they believe best represents the severity of pain. Always &quot;0&quot; means no pain, while &quot;10&quot; means excruciating pain.&#xD;
When asked, patients touch a point corresponding to their degree of pain, and this mark indicates the degree of pain on the scale. Higher scores indicate greater pain severity. Preoperative, postoperative day 0, pre-taping, postoperative 1st day, postoperative 2nd day, postoperative 7th day and postoperative 1st month were evaluated.</description>

    <description>Pulmonary function testing was performed using a digital spirometer (Pony FX, COSMED Inc., Italy) with subjects in a comfortable 90-degree sitting position.This test was repeated 3 times for each patient and the best value was recorded. A 1-minute rest period was given between each test. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), Forced vital capacity (FVC), 1 second forced expiratory volume to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC), peak expiratory flow (PEF), 25-75% forced expiratory flow (FEF25-75) have been recorded. The tests were performed preoperatively, postoperative day 0, before tape application, postoperative day 1, postoperative day 2, postoperative day 7, and postoperative 1 month.</description>

    <measure>Change of Respiratory Muscle Strength</measure>

    <description>Respiratory muscle strength was evaluated by measuring maximal inspiratory and maximal expiratory pressures with a portable intraoral pressure measuring device (Pony FX, COSMED Inc., Italy). During the measurements, participants were verbally encouraged for maximum performance. The maneuvers were repeated at least 5 times at intervals of at least 30 seconds, and the best among the measurements with a 5-10% difference was selected for analysis. MIP and MEP values were determined as cmH2O. The tests were performed preoperatively, postoperative day 0, before tape application, postoperative day 1, postoperative day 2, postoperative day 7, and postoperative 1 month.</description>

    <description>The Short Form-36 (SF-36) quality of life scoring was used to evaluate the quality of life of the patients. SF-36 is a questionnaire with 8 subscales that gives information about the health status and quality of life of the person. SF-36 was translated into Turkish in 1999. Confirmation studies were conducted in different patient groups.The tests were applied in the preoperative period, at the postoperative 1st month.</description>

    <description>On the postoperative 0th day, kinesiology taping was applied to the patients in the study group whose hemodynamic status was stable after extubation by an expert physiotherapist. All tapes were applied by the same physiotherapist on clean and shaved skin (if necessary). Investigators applied kinesiology taping as described below:&#xD;
In order to stimulate the facilitation of the diaphragmatic function, a 5 cm wide kinesiological tape was applied on the skin.&#xD;
Taping was applied to the latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior muscles, which were cut during the thoracotomy.&#xD;
In addition, kinesiology taping can be performed on the trigger pain point of the patient (usually above the pectoralis major).&#xD;
The kinesiology tape can stay for 3-4 days if the patient does not develop any discomfort. After 3-4 days, the tape was renewed. Thus, taping was done twice for each patient. The bands were removed at 1 week postoperatively.</description>
