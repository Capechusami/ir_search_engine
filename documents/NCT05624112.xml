  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 16-week, open label, exploratory study designed to investigate dupilumab's effect&#xD;
      on skin barrier function as measured by transepidermal water loss (TEWL) before and after&#xD;
      skin tape stripping. During the first 2 treatment weeks, patients will have 2 on-site&#xD;
      visits/week, followed by one on-site visit/week up to Week 4, one on-site visit every two&#xD;
      weeks from Week 4 to Week 8, and one on-site visit every 4 weeks up to Week 16 End of&#xD;
      Treatment phase visit (EoT) thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up visit by phone 4 weeks after the last study assessment at Week 16 will end the&#xD;
      study for each participant (End of Study: EoS). The maximum duration of the study per&#xD;
      participant will be 24 weeks.&#xD;
