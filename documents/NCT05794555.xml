    <textblock>
      This multicenter trial is being conducted to determine if sequential lactulose and Tele&#xD;
      (virtual) Tai-Chi reduces the rate of injurious fall, non-injurious falls, incident overt&#xD;
      Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE), and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that are enrolled will be randomized to stage one of this project for&#xD;
      approximately 12 weeks. After completing stage one, participants will be re-evaluated and if&#xD;
      eligible will be re-randomized to stage 2 of the project that will last approximately 12 more&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesizes that sequential lactulose/TeleTai-Chi will reduce falls, incident&#xD;
      overt HE, death and physical frailty and will improve cognitive function, and Health Related&#xD;
      Quality of Life (HRQOL) over 24 weeks compared to other treatment combinations.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized in stage 1 to enhanced usual care or enhanced usual care plus lactulose. After 12 weeks participants will be re-evaluated to continue into stage 2 will be re-randomized to TeleTai-Chi (at-home, via Zoom, supervised by a study team instructor) vs. continued enhanced usual care. The participants that took lactulose in Stage 1 will continue to take lactulose through Stage 2 until their participation is complete.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>A hierarchical composite of events over 24 weeks: injurious falls, non-injurious falls, incident Hepatic Encephalopathy, and death</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 weeks (following stage 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Composite outcome is defined as any of the following:&#xD;
Injurious Fall: Fracture, dislocation, cut, head injury, soft - tissue injury requiring hospitalization&#xD;
Non - Injurious Fall: Inadvertently coming to rest on the floor or lower level&#xD;
Incident Overt HE: Acute disorientation requiring hospitalization or the initiation of HE - directed therapy, confirmed by a gastroenterologist or study investigator&#xD;
Death: Mortality with any cause</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Function based on the Animal Naming Test (ANT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 weeks (following stage 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The animal naming test assesses cognitive function. It is a timed test that that consists of participants listing as many unique animals as possible in 60 seconds. This is a validated test used for the assessment of hepatic encephalopathy. The score is the number of unique animals stated (higher is better).</description>

    <description>Patients will be provided and counseled on two methods which will enhance care. The first is a handout on nutrition recommendations and protein supplementation. This will include the recommendation of both high protein snacks during the daytime (e.g., protein bars) and a high-protein night-time snack (e.g., peanut butter and crackers). The second will be to counsel participants on falls prevention methods that can be enacted in day-to-day life. All participants will be provided with a standard hand-out of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-endorsed fall-risk reduction measures.</description>

    <description>Patients will be prescribed lactulose and will also receive enhanced usual care. Lactulose will be taken on a specific schedule based on the average number of bowel movements on average per day. It will be started at 15 milliliter (mL) dose and will be instructed to slowly increase the lactulose dose over the course of the first week of Stage 1 participation. The prescribed maximum dose will be 30 mL (20g) twice daily. The dose will slowly increase toward the maximum or until participants reach 2-3 soft bowel movements daily.&#xD;
Participants that receive Lactulose during stage 1 will continue this in stage 2 (if re-randomized).</description>
