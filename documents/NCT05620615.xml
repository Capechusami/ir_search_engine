  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To observe the safety and efficacy of intensive drug therapy for ischemic stroke&#xD;
      patients.Patients with acute stroke caused by intracranial arterial stenosis (stenosis rate&#xD;
      ≥70%) were enrolled and accept dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) (aspirin 100 mg/d and&#xD;
      clopidogrel 75 mg/d for 90 days, followed by aspirin 100 mg/d for long term) under the&#xD;
      guidance of platelet function analysis (Verifynow) combined with the intensive statin therapy&#xD;
      (40 mg/d for 14 days, followed by 20 mg/d for long term).&#xD;

      Patients (35 to 80 years ) with acute ischemic stroke, who can be treated within 72 hours of&#xD;
      symptom onset will be enrolled. Patients fulfilling all of the inclusion criteria and none of&#xD;
      the exclusion criteria will be randomly selected.Patients were treated with dual antiplatelet&#xD;
      therapy (DAPT) (aspirin 100 mg per day and clopidogrel 75 mg per day were administered for 90&#xD;
      days, followed by aspirin 100 mg per day for long term) and atorvastatin (40 mg per day for&#xD;
      14 days, followed by 20 mg per day long term) after enrollment. Patients with aspirin&#xD;
      resistance (aspirin reaction units [ARU] ≥550) or clopidogrel resistance (P2Y12 reaction&#xD;
      units [PRU] ≥208) were excluded on the 7th day of therapy.The primary objective is to observe&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of intensive drug therapy for ischemic stroke patients. A Data and&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety during the study. The trial has&#xD;
      been approved by the Ethics Committee of Huashan Hospital.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) changes</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Assess patients' prognosis by the score of modified Rankin Scale (mRS). In the mRS, the lowest score is 0, the highest score is 6, and higher scores mean worse outcome. A score of 0 indicates the patients have no symptoms at all, and a score of 6 indicates the patients are dead. In this study, we evaluate patient's outcomes by the following criteria. A favorable outcome is defined as an mRS score of 0 to 2, an excellent outcome is defined as an mRS score of 0 to 1, whereas a poor outcome is defined as mRS&gt;2.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of functional recovery or deterioration from baseline to 7 days after stroke onset, is measured by the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, short for NIHSS. NIHSS score from 0-42, higher scores mean worse outcome. We define early functional improvement as an improvement of ≥ 4 points on the NIHSS or the resolution of the neurologic deficit, and early neurological deterioration as a decline by ≥ 4 points in the total NIHSS score within 7 days of symptom onset.</description>
