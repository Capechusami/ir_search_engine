  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that nociceptive afferences in visceral pain and visceral disorders increase&#xD;
      sensitization in subjects suffering from fibromyalgia. These patients use to present visceral&#xD;
      comorbidities. Those comorbidities include that of peridiaphragmatic organs, which are&#xD;
      supplied by the phrenic nerve among other innervations. It is known that peridiaphragmatic&#xD;
      organs trigger referred pain in the neck area, via the phrenic nerves. So, the phrenic&#xD;
      nociceptive afferences can be contributing to enhance the state of sensitization in&#xD;
      fibromyalgia. This study aims to analyze the ability of phrenic nerve infiltration to&#xD;
      diminish sensitization in subjects suffering fibromyalgia, by means of a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a major problem due to issues such as the impact on quality of life and the&#xD;
      associated health and social costs. It is characterized by a generalized state of&#xD;
      sensitization, with a high level of perceived pain, among other features. Peripheral pain&#xD;
      sources potentially exacerbate the central sensitization and its symptoms of chronic diffuse&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain and hyperalgesia. It has been shown that visceral pain enhances the&#xD;
      level of central sensitization typical of the syndrome. So, it has been claimed that&#xD;
      systematic assessment and treatment of visceral pain comorbidities should be a part of the&#xD;
      management strategy in fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with fibromyalgia present visceral comorbidities. Those comorbidities include that&#xD;
      of peridiaphragmatic organs, which are supplied by the phrenic nerve among other&#xD;
      innervations. It is known that peridiaphragmatic organs trigger referred pain in the neck&#xD;
      area, via the phrenic nerves. So, the phrenic nociceptive afferences can be contributing to&#xD;
      enhance the state of sensitization in fibromyalgia. This study aims to analyze the ability of&#xD;
      phrenic nerve infiltration to diminish sensitization in subjects suffering fibromyalgia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, the investigators intend to perform a randomized clinical trial, assessing&#xD;
      the effects on pain threshold to pressure, visual analogue scale, range of motion and&#xD;
      fibromyalgia specific questionnaires. There will be only one intervention session. The&#xD;
      experimental group will receive an ultrasound-guided anaesthetic infiltration of the phrenic&#xD;
      nerve, while the control group will receive a placebo infiltration. A one-week follow-up,&#xD;
      with intermediate measurements, will be carried out to assess the evolution of sensitization&#xD;
      and symptomatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will make it possible to establish the role of phrenic afferences&#xD;
      in fibromyalgia sensitization, thus making it possible to specify a specific therapeutic&#xD;
      target (phrenic nerve) as well as the importance of visceral treatment in subjects with&#xD;
      fibromyalgia.&#xD;

    <measure>Fibromyalgia Survey Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention. Post-intervention: 7 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Fibromyalgia Survey Questionnaire (Questionnaire) (parts I and III). The Fibromyalgia Survey Questionnaire will be used in the Spanish version. This questionnaire assesses the severity of fibromyalgia symptoms. The first part of this questionnaire is constituted by 3 questions related to the last week, and they have to be answered by likert scales of 3 points. Higher scores indicate higher disability. The third part of this questionnaire is constituted by a qualitative localization of pain in the last week. A higher number of body regions suffering pain constitute a worse outcome. Parts II and IV of the questionnaire will not be considered as an outcome measure since they evaluate periods of 6 months and 3 months respectively, and our post-intervention measurement will be performed just 7 days after intervention, so these parts of the questionnaire have no interest as outcome measures.</description>

It will be used in the Spanish version. This questionnaire assesses the severity of fibromyalgia symptoms. Scores range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating higher disability.</description>
