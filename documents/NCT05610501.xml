      In a transvaginal tru-cut biopsy, guided by ultrasound, a needle is inserted through the&#xD;
      vaginal wall into a pelvic lesion and a few pieces of tissue are obtained for examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is organized to evaluate the safety and efficacy of transvaginal tru-cut&#xD;
      biopsy in a large group of patients with tumors in the small pelvis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is known to be the 4th most lethal tumour in women and has the highest&#xD;
      mortality rate of all gynaecological malignancies. In most women, the disease is not&#xD;
      diagnosed until advanced stage [1]. Moreover, the pelvis and ovaries in particular, are also&#xD;
      a common place for secondary metastases. In 4% of ovarian masses, metastasis can be found&#xD;
      from a tumour with another primary origin [2]. In primary ovarian cancer, patients may&#xD;
      benefit from either primary debulking surgery or neoadjuvant therapy, depending on tumour&#xD;
      staging and patients' comorbidities [5]. In recurrent disease treatment may include surgery,&#xD;
      radiotherapy or systemic therapy, depending on primary tumour histology, extent of&#xD;
      recurrence, previous treatment and disease-free interval [6-8]. In pelvic masses with&#xD;
      ultrasound features suggesting metastatic disease, management will be guided by the origin of&#xD;
      the primary tumour [9,10]. Therefore, histological diagnosis is important to select the&#xD;
      optimal treatment strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue sampling by diagnostic laparoscopy or explorative laparotomy requires general&#xD;
      anaesthesia and hospital admission, leading to higher costs and to potential surgical&#xD;
      morbidity. Moreover, diagnostic laparoscopy is associated with a risk of port-site&#xD;
      metastasis, ranging from 0.3-0.4% in endometrial and cervical cancer [11] and even 17-49% in&#xD;
      advanced ovarian cancer [12,13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimally invasive procedures for diagnosis include fine-needle aspiration and tru-cut&#xD;
      biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At fine-needle aspiration the quantity and integrity of the tissue is limited, enabling&#xD;
      cytological evaluation only [14]. Tru-cut biopsy results in a higher specificity compared to&#xD;
      fine needle biopsy and it enables histological examination including immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      [15,16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tru-cut biopsy can be performed under the guidance of different imaging modalities&#xD;
      including ultrasound, Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However,&#xD;
      percutaneous CT-guided biopsies of deep pelvic masses are challenging because vital&#xD;
      structures often obstruct the needle pathway [17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have investigated the use of ultrasound-guided biopsies for the assessment&#xD;
      of abdominal and pelvic masses which showed a high diagnostic adequacy and minimal&#xD;
      complication rate [4,16,18-25]. This can be done by percutaneous transabdominal approach , a&#xD;
      transvaginal or transrectal approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of this prospective study is to evaluate the safety and tissue yield of&#xD;
      ultrasound guided transvaginal or transrectal tru-cut biopsy in patients with pelvic tumors.&#xD;
      Secondly, factors affecting the reliability of the biopsy-results will be analyzed, as well&#xD;
      as patients' experience and pain. Finally, a comparison of biopsy results and final&#xD;
      histological diagnosis will be performed in those patients undergoing surgical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Study aims Primary Aim The main goal of our study is 1) to evaluate the safety (defined as&#xD;
      absence of procedure-related complications) and 2) tissue yield (defined as sufficient amount&#xD;
      of tissue for histological analysis) of ultrasound guided transvaginal or transrectal tru-cut&#xD;
      biopsy in patients with pelvic masses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyzing factors affecting the safety and tissue yield. (The influence of selected&#xD;
           variables such as number of biopsies per target lesion, length of the shot (15 vs 22&#xD;
           mm), thickness of needle (16-18 G), target lesion, target lesion size, histotypes etc.&#xD;
           on these outcomes will be assessed.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of patients' overall experience, assessment of pain and discomfort during the&#xD;
           procedure and afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of biopsy result with final histological diagnosis: histological type (only&#xD;
           in patients finally undergoing surgery)&#xD;

    <description>All consecutive patients (&gt; 18 years) undergoing a tru-cut biopsy at the participating centers during the study periof will be eligible for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
All biopsies will be performed by trained operators in gynecologic ultrasound and tru-cut biopsies. Tissue samples will be assessed by experienced pathologists, dedicated in gynecologic oncology. Data will be collected by reviewing patients' electronic medical file including data concerning further treatment-strategy and pathology reports. Patients' level of pain and overall experience will be assessed by an independent investigator not present during biopsy. This will be performed from 0-72h after the biopsy using a numeric rating scale (0-100). Safety and complication-rate will be assessed by both using the collected data and via postprocedural assessment and by phone after six weeks. Inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found elsewhere.</description>
