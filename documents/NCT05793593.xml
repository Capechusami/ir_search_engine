  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Black community has higher rates of colorectal cancer and lower rates of colorectal&#xD;
      cancer screenings than whites. Getting screened through FIT testing may help catch colorectal&#xD;
      cancer earlier, when it is easier to treat. MSK has created a program to help people who have&#xD;
      been FIT tested to also help their peers (family, friends, and colleagues) in their community&#xD;
      get FIT tested. The researchers think that training people on peer outreach, such as telling&#xD;
      people in your social network about FIT testing and how to get it, may increase the rate of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer screening. The purpose of this study is to see if training people on peer&#xD;
      outreach increases the number of people who get screened for colorectal cancer through FIT&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;

    <description>All participants will be educated, on a simplified clinical and medical background of CRC; causes and risk factors for CRC; eligibility criteria for screening; lifestyle modifications to lower risk of developing CRC; screening methods for CRC, including FIT and colonoscopy; addressing myths and misconceptions about CRC; and information about resources for low-cost and no-cost screening, screening for the uninsured and screening for those without legal immigration documentation. Participants will also be educated on elements of fecal immunochemical testing (detects signs of cancer in the stool, can be done at home and sent to a laboratory for analysis, needs to be done yearly to ensure maximal effectiveness for cancer screening). Follow-up Assessment at 8 months complete follow-up form and assist in completion of peer outreach tracker Provide reminders to encourage participants to encourage peers to get FIT tested.</description>
