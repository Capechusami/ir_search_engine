    <textblock>
      We retrospectively reviewed 1317 patients who had undergone HT and completed 9-month&#xD;
      follow-up between January 2018 and June 2021 at 4 medical centers. The incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative folliculitis and the patient demographics were assessed. Logistic regression&#xD;
      analysis was used to identify the risk factors, and the characteristics of different types of&#xD;
      folliculitis were compared.&#xD;

      Postoperative folliculitis is a common complication after hair transplantation (HT) and&#xD;
      requires effective preventive interventions. This study aimed to characterize postoperative&#xD;
      folliculitis and determine the risk factors in patients underwent HT. The study was conducted&#xD;
      at 4 clinical sites: Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University, the First Affiliated&#xD;
      Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, the Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical&#xD;
      University, and Peking University Third Hospital. Data of 1317 patients who had undergone HT&#xD;
      and completed a 9-month follow-up from January 2018 to June 2021 were collected. The&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative folliculitis and the patient demographics were assessed. Logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors, and the characteristics of&#xD;
      different types of folliculitis were compared.&#xD;
