    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic surgery has become the standard of care for surgical procedures across multiple&#xD;
      specialties, reducing perioperative complications, accelerating recovery and providing&#xD;
      superior cosmetic results. Trocars are used in laparoscopic procedures to provide a portal&#xD;
      for the placement of surgical instruments. Typically, three to four or more trocars of&#xD;
      different sizes ranging from 5 to 15 mm in diameter are used in abdominal and pelvic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several methods for closure of trocar wounds are known in laparoscopic surgery including&#xD;
      mostly transcutaneous or subcuticular suture or adhesive paper tape. The skin closure method&#xD;
      should aim to keep the skin closely opposed during the hemostatic and inflammatory healing&#xD;
      phases until the overlapping proliferative phase is able to provide tensile strength. The&#xD;
      choice of technique is often based on the surgeon's personal experience. and is largely&#xD;
      dependent on training exposure and local opinion. There is currently no consensus as to the&#xD;
      optimal method of closure of the skin following laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous meta-analyses examining skin closure methods for all surgical wounds have found&#xD;
      suture to have significantly decreased rates of wound dehiscence compared to tissue adhesive.&#xD;
      Meta-analysis published recently by Aitchison et al. compared between sutures, tissue&#xD;
      adhesives and adhesive paper tape. They reported no difference in patient-evaluated cosmesis,&#xD;
      prolonged pain, or patient satisfaction between the three groups. Nevertheless, no data&#xD;
      specifically address the obese population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Port-site trocar incision closure is a challenging procedure in laparoscopic surgeries,&#xD;
      particularly in patients with clinically severe (morbid) obesity. Complications related to&#xD;
      port-site trocars, even if uncommon, may have severe consequences that can lead to&#xD;
      reoperation and permanent damage Studies comparing laparoscopic incision closure in bariatric&#xD;
      population are limited. Fecso et al conducted a retrospective cohort study including 1579&#xD;
      bariatric patients, of them 494 were treated with tissue adhesive for skin closure. They&#xD;
      reported that the use of tissue adhesive was more common in patients who developed incisional&#xD;
      surgical site infection compared with those without incisional surgical site infection (SSI)&#xD;
      (54.3 vs. 30.8%, p = 0.003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our department usually practice subcuticular and adhesive glue for the closure of&#xD;
      laparoscopic incisions, based on surgeon's preference. As obese population comprise most of&#xD;
      our surgical candidates, and due to the aforementioned, the aim of our study is to compare&#xD;
      the outcomes of both techniques in obese women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods This is a prospective study that will be conducted in a single tertiary&#xD;
      medical center. Study population will include all women undergoing gynecologic laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery with BMI of 30 kg/mÂ² or above. Women with connective tissue disease will be excluded&#xD;
      from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Each woman will undergo both interventions therefore will serve as her own control. All&#xD;
           ports up to 8 mm (following robotic or conventional laparoscopy) will be eligible for&#xD;
           inclusion in the study. The umbilicus will serve as a reference separating the right and&#xD;
           left side incisions. Each side will be closed randomly using one of the two techniques.&#xD;
           Randomizing the closure technique will be done based on the serial number given to each&#xD;
           woman on recruitment (En block randomization) :&#xD;
&#xD;
           Odd serial number: Right side - subcuticular suturing, Left side- adhesive glue Even&#xD;
           numbers: Right side- adhesive glue, Left side- subcuticular suturing&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Incisions would be closed by one or the other following techniques: 1- Subcuticular&#xD;
           closure- using 4-0 Monocryl suture will be used; 2- Adhesive glue (Dermabond).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. On follow up visit 2- and 8-weeks post operation - each woman will complete the&#xD;
           validated Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ) on follow-up at 2- and 8-weeks&#xD;
           post operation for the right and left side of the abdomen(10). The PSAQ consists of 4&#xD;
           scored subscales: Appearance, Consciousness, Appearance Satisfaction, and Symptom&#xD;
           Satisfaction. Each subscale has a set of questions with a 4-point categorical response&#xD;
           (1=most favorable, 4=least favorable). The sum of the scores quantifies each subscale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical characteristics will be collected from women's medical files.&#xD;
      Operative and post-operative data will be collected including: operation duration, estimated&#xD;
      blood loss, operation complications (hypotension, bladder gut or vascular perforation),&#xD;
      post-operative complications (hemorrhage, endometritis, vascular - thromboembolic event,&#xD;
      ileus).&#xD;
