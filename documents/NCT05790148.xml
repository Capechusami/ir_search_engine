  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trials to evaluate precision of different scanbodies in same&#xD;
      participant group. The main guestion it aim to answer is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Are the precision of the three different scanbodies used in direct digitalization the same&#xD;
      for the produce of implant-supported prostheses?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are healty and have short edentulous span in posterior region that will receive&#xD;
      implant-supported prostheses.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Twenty-five patients receiving two implant supported restorations in treatment of short-span&#xD;
      partial edentulism were enrolled into the study. Three different scanbodies, original,&#xD;
      non-original and generic, were employed for direct digitalization technique. Full contour&#xD;
      PMMA restorations were CAD/CAM fabricated from each digital record, and were evaluated in&#xD;
      terms of implant fit, axial- and occlusal-contact. Additionally, patient's impressions for&#xD;
      digitalization and delivery procedures were recorded using a visual analog scale. Scanbody&#xD;
      scan recordings were subjected to reverse engineering for analytical evaluation of 3D virtual&#xD;
      implant positioning.&#xD;

    <description>Patient impression was done in two clinical stages, registration and restoration delivery, and a scale of five points from 0 to 100 was used. A value of 0 is set to be straightforward and 100 complex. During the registration phase, the patient's anxiety level about the direct digitalization procedure, which was explained in detail before registration, was determined. After the registration, it was asked to evaluate the difficulty of the process. The time spent for adjustment during the restoration delivery phase and the comfort feeling of the restoration after adjustment were evaluated.</description>

    <description>Three different brand scanbodies (Straumann, Medentika, 3Shape) that applied in same participant group with randomization are used in this clinical study. These three different scan bodies are digitized using an intraoral scanner. Three different temporary restorations are designed in the CAD program and three different bridges are produced with the milling technique using the temporary restoration block. Clinical and analytic evaluations were perform and primarly, seconderly outcomes were achieved.</description>
