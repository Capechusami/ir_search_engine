        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Infants &lt;8 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Infants with a clinical diagnosis of Cow's Milk Allergy (CMA) per local hospital&#xD;
             practice, including any of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Based on clinical examination with a careful history, parent-reported symptoms&#xD;
                  suggestive of CMA, and disappearance of the symptoms when cow's milk was&#xD;
                  eliminated from the diet for at least two weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Based on clinical examination with a careful history, parent-reported symptoms&#xD;
                  suggestive of CMA, and disappearance of the symptoms while being breastfed with&#xD;
                  maternal cow's milk protein elimination diet for at least two weeks prior to&#xD;
                  study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. History of CoMiSS® score &gt;10 indicating symptoms are likely cow's milk allergic&#xD;
                  prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. History of positive result of an oral food challenge with cow's milk prior to&#xD;
                  study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Presence of specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) to cow's milk protein based on skin&#xD;
                  prick test (wheel size ≥3mm) or radio-allergosorbent-test (RAST) (&gt;0.7 kilounit&#xD;
                  per liter (kU/L)) prior to or on the day of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. 3. Infants that are still on dairy-derived extensively hydrolysed formula, amino&#xD;
             acid-based formula, hydrolysed rice protein formula, soy-based formula or being&#xD;
             breastfed by mothers who are on cow's milk protein elimination diet at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Parents / guardians confirm their intention not to administer any products containing&#xD;
             cow's milk protein during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Expected to consume the specified age-dependent minimum amount of study product per&#xD;
             day during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Expected to require a milk substitute for CMA management for at least 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Written informed consent provided by parents / guardians, according to local law.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

          2. Infants &lt;37 weeks gestation requiring specific premature formula at the time of study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Infants with severe concurrent illness and/or have undergone gastrointestinal surgery&#xD;
             such as bowel resection or stoma placement and/or with Down syndrome or other&#xD;
             syndromes where functional gastrointestinal disorders are common.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Infants that are more suitable to use Amino Acid Formula (AAF) as first-line formula,&#xD;
             including but not limited to those with high risk of anaphylaxis (prior history of&#xD;
             anaphylaxis and currently not using extensively Hydrolysed Formula (eHF)), faltering&#xD;
             growth / failure to thrive, or severe forms of non-IgE-mediated CMA such as&#xD;
             eosinophilic oesophagitis, enteropathies, or Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis&#xD;
             Syndrome (FPIES).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Infants with diagnosis of rice allergy or known allergy to any of the ingredients in&#xD;
             the study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Investigator's uncertainty about the willingness or ability of the parents / guardians&#xD;
