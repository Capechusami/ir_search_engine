    <textblock>
      The Tender Study is a prospective, open-label, single-center, randomized,&#xD;
      investigator-initiated clinical study seeks to investigate the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      DEXTENZA insert in pediatric patients following retinal surgery or laser treatment under&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to enroll 30 pediatric patients undergoing routine retinal surgery or laser&#xD;
      treatment under anesthesia. Patients in each treatment group (surgery or laser) will be&#xD;
      randomized 2:1 at the time of surgery/laser to receive either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Treatment Arm: Dextenza insert intraoperatively for perioperative ocular inflammation&#xD;
           and pain. These patients will not be prescribed topical steroid drops post-operatively,&#xD;
           or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control Arm: Prednisolone forte 1% steroid drop taper for 28 days post-operatively to&#xD;
           treat perioperative ocular inflammation and pain; drops four times per day (QUID) on&#xD;
           days 0-7, three times per day (TID) on days 7-14, twice per day (BID) on days 14-21 and&#xD;
           once per day (QD) on days 21-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment group (surgery or laser) will include 15 patients total, 10 receiving Dextenza&#xD;
      and 5 receiving the control drug. Drops for dilation and antibiotic coverage will be used as&#xD;
      clinically indicated in all groups throughout the study period. Follow up will occur at&#xD;
      post-op day 1, 7, 28/30 and 45 ( +/- three days for all post-operative timepoints).&#xD;
