  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to form a chronological map of common diseases and rare diseases&#xD;
      in Chinese population by determining the prevalence of different diseases in each age group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studying the distribution of various diseases in specific populations can help explore the&#xD;
      causes of diseases, elucidate the distribution patterns, and develop preventive and control&#xD;
      measures. Based on an overall assessment of prevalence, the combination of relevant results&#xD;
      with age at diagnosis for multiple diseases is important for further understanding of the&#xD;
      distribution of diseases at the population level. Therefore, this study aims to form a&#xD;
      chronological map of common diseases and rare diseases in Chinese population by determining&#xD;
      the prevalence of different diseases in each age group, thus providing a reference for more&#xD;
      effective prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases.&#xD;
