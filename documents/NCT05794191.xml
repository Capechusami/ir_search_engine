  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about how well a vaccine (Prevnar 13, PCV13) works in&#xD;
      preventing disease in adults with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diseases studied are pneumonia. Mostly the ones caused by the bacteria - pneumococcus.&#xD;
      This study also evaluates the type of pneumonia that is spread into the bloodstream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in the study will be identified in health care databases. Adults with HIV&#xD;
      will be identified by looking for a medical diagnosis that has confirmed HIV from the&#xD;
      databases. Vaccination will be identified in the databases by looking for vaccine&#xD;
      administration or for PCV13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed in the databases to see if they have one of the diseases&#xD;
      mentioned above or not. The number of vaccinated participants with the diseases will be&#xD;
      compared to the number participants without the vaccines but with the diseases. This will&#xD;
      help to understand how well the vaccine worked.&#xD;
