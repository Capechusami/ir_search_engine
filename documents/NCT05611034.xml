  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating a new technique for delivering chemotherapy directly into the&#xD;
      lungs at the time of surgery. Delivering chemotherapy directly to the lungs could potentially&#xD;
      kill any microscopic cancer cells that are present in the lungs at the time of surgery, while&#xD;
      sparing other major organs in the body from the side effects of chemotherapy. This technique&#xD;
      is called In Vivo Lung Perfusion (IVLP). At the University Health Network, this IVLP&#xD;
      technique has been used recently in a Phase I study in patients with sarcoma, and we are now&#xD;
      expanding on that experience to include patients with colorectal metastases. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to test the safety of the IVLP technique and find the dose that seems right in&#xD;
      humans. Participants are given oxaliplatin into one lung via IVLP and are watched very&#xD;
      closely to see what side effects they have and to make sure the side effects are not severe.&#xD;
      If the side effects are not severe, then more participants are asked to join the study and&#xD;
      are given a higher dose of oxaliplatin. Participants joining the study later on will get&#xD;
      higher doses of oxaliplatin than participants who join earlier. This will continue until a&#xD;
      dose is found that causes severe but temporary side effects. Doses higher than that will not&#xD;
      be given. The other lung will not be infused with anything, so that we can limit unforeseen&#xD;
      toxicity to a single lung and see if one lung does better than the other.&#xD;
