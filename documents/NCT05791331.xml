    <textblock>
      This study is an interventional, non-pharmacological, multicentric, randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      superiority, non-profit study. Its primary objective is to evaluate if the administration of&#xD;
      surfactant based on FOT assessment will allow a 5-day reduction in the duration of&#xD;
      respiratory support as compared to standard practice in preterm infants between 27+0 and 32+6&#xD;
      weeks' gestation. The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine if a lung mechanics-based approach for administering surfactant will change&#xD;
           treatment timing; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to assess the impact of the novel approach on other neonatal general outcomes. The study&#xD;
           will take place within the neonatal intensive care units. Non-invasive respiratory&#xD;
           support will be delivered by nasal CPAP with a starting pressure of 5-8 cmH2O. FiO2 will&#xD;
           be titrated in order to achieve the target SpO2 91-95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants matching the clinical criteria for inclusion will be randomized in two arms following&#xD;
      the current data protection and confidentiality regulations. Central, computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization (allocation 1:1) with variable block sizes according to gestational age will be&#xD;
      used. Infants will be stratified according to gestational age (27+0 -28+6 weeks; 29+0 -30+6&#xD;
      weeks; 31+0 -32+6 weeks) and center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Surfactant administration following oxygenation-based criteria (clinical assessment)&#xD;
      (control) B) Surfactant administration following both lung mechanics assessment OR&#xD;
      oxygenation-based criteria (clinical assessment) (intervention).&#xD;
