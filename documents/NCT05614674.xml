  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-efficacy is defined as a person's confidence or belief that one can achieve a certain&#xD;
      behavioral or cognitive state. Self-efficacy is one of the most important assesment&#xD;
      parameters in the self-management model. It is accepted that patients with chronic low back&#xD;
      pain with high self-efficacy have a better prognosis than those with low self-efficacy. Due&#xD;
      to the complex nature of pain; The relationship between psychological and physical parameters&#xD;
      such as pain catastrophy, disability level, depression, physical performance, self-efficacy,&#xD;
      pain intensity and fear avoidance arouses curiosity. The aim of this cross-sectional study is&#xD;
      to examine the relationship between the level of self-efficacy and sensory, perceptual and&#xD;
      motor skills in people with chronic low back pain.&#xD;
