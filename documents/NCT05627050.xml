    <textblock>
      Video Communications, like ZOOM, have been widely used in the time of this epidemic. But how&#xD;
      about to design an AR / VR communication system with coaching from clinician to facilitate&#xD;
      training at home in this time of epidemic. Vulnerable individuals at home can interact with&#xD;
      the training platform and his/her clinician can provide online training progamme with&#xD;
      guidance.&#xD;

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month after the first training</time_frame>
    <description>Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper-Extremity the maximum score is 66, divided into 33 items in the form of a 3-point scale (0-2), 0 is cannot perform and 2 performs fully.&#xD;
Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Lower-Extremity consists of 34-level cumulative scoring system to examine lower-limb functions of hemiplegic stroke patients quantitatively through a set of lower-limb movement tasks in reflex, flexor/extensor synergy, volitional movement, coordination and speed (Fugl-Meyer, et al., 1975).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The 12-item Short Form Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month after the first training</time_frame>
    <description>It is a self-reported outcome measure assessing the impact of health on an individual's everyday life. It is often used as a quality-of-life measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Barthel Index</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month after the first training</time_frame>
    <description>It assesses functional independence, generally in stroke patients.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month after the first training</time_frame>
    <description>Berg Balance Scale (BBS), consists of 56-level measures to examine balance ability and to predict falling risk with high reliability (ICC=0.98) (Steffen, Hacker &amp; Mollinger, 2002). Stroke patients were assessed based on their performance on 14 simple mobility tasks, including transfer, standing, and reaching</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month after the first training</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), consists of 4-level scale to examine joint spasticity based on muscle tone and resistance detected during passive stretching with good inter-rater reliability (ICC =0.85) (Bohannon &amp; Smith, 1987).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Ambulation Category Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month after the first training</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Ambulatory Category (FAC) is a reliable measurement of independent walking ability on level-ground walking and stair ambulation, which is a good prediction of independent community walking post-stroke (Mehrholz, et al., 2007). FAC consists of 6-level scale: patients with FAC=4 requires supervision in level ground walking, FAC=5 requires supervision only when walking on non-level surface such as stairs.</description>
