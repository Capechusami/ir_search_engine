  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm community-based feasibility study examining recruitment, retention,&#xD;
      adherence, and satisfaction with ENGAGE, a community-based intervention designed to address&#xD;
      pandemic-related social isolation among people with disabilities. We will also examine&#xD;
      preliminary, within-group effects on social participation. The findings of this study will&#xD;
      inform a larger trial to examine intervention efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social isolation has been shown to negatively affect physical and mental health, particularly&#xD;
      among people with disabilities. Social isolation among people with disabilities has been&#xD;
      exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Even now, people with disabilities remain hesitant to&#xD;
      return to social and community activities due to ongoing risk of severe cases and death. Yet,&#xD;
      we do not have strong models of intervention designed to address this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENGAGE is an intervention that may address this gap. ENGAGE was designed to address social&#xD;
      and community participation among people with stroke. We have since conducted qualitative&#xD;
      research to inform adaptation of ENGAGE to meet the needs of a broader range of people with&#xD;
      disabilities related to participation in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This&#xD;
      study is the next step in testing and refining the adapted intervention protocol. At the end&#xD;
      of this study, we will have a finalized adapted intervention protocol ready for large-scale&#xD;
      efficacy testing.&#xD;
