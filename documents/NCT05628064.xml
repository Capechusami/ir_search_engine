    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to characterize the extend of 1C70 meeting the amputees needs&#xD;
      in comparison with their everyday and a comparator foot, in regards of daily activities,&#xD;
      mobility and balance, as well as quality of life and pain.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D-5L: 1C70 vs everyday foot</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline measurement vs 2 months after fitting with 1C70</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of health status composed of 5 dimensions: mobility, ability to self-care, ability to undertake usual activities, pain and discomfort, anxiety and depression. Each dimension is rated on a 5-point scale indicating the level of perceived problems for each dimension (level 1 indicating no problems and level 5 indicating extreme problems). Each health state can potentially be assigned a summary index score based on societal preference weights for the health state. These weights, sometimes referred to as 'utilities', are often used to compute QALYs for use in health economic analyses. Health state index scores generally range from less than 0 (where 0 is the value of a health state equivalent to dead; negative values representing values as worse than dead) to 1 (the value of full health), with higher scores indicating higher health utility.</description>
