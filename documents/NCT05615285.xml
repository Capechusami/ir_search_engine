      There is strong evidence that exercise can help improve physical and mental wellbeing after&#xD;
      treatment for cancer. However, at present, people with cancer in Ireland are not given the&#xD;
      opportunity to have an individual assessment of their physical and psychological wellbeing as&#xD;
      part of standard care and are not routinely prescribed exercise-based rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will run and evaluate a system to i. assess physical and psychological&#xD;
      wellbeing of people who have completed cancer treatment, ii. apply a rehabilitation triage&#xD;
      system, based on findings of the assessment, iii. refer participants to one of three&#xD;
      rehabilitation pathways, as per outcome of the triage process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation pathways are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants who are currently active and have no cancer-specific impairments will&#xD;
           receive advice from the physiotherapist on maintaining their current levels of activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants who are not active and have no cancer-specific impairments will be referred&#xD;
           to a suitable community-based exercise programme. This programme must contain both&#xD;
           resistance and aerobic training and should have some level of supervision from a fitness&#xD;
           professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants who are not active and have ongoing cancer-specific impairments will be&#xD;
           referred to an oncology specialist physiotherapist, funded through this work, at St&#xD;
           James's Hospital for assessment and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be encouraged to visit www.cancerrehabilitation.ie for information&#xD;
      through out the study. Participants will be reassessed 12 weeks after the initial assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of this system will be evaluated using the RE-AIM framework.&#xD;

      Background During and following treatment for cancer, people can experience negative&#xD;
      side-effects of treatment, including loss of fitness, weakness, fatigue and psychological&#xD;
      issues such as depression and anxiety. There is strong evidence that exercise can help&#xD;
      improve these symptoms. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic means that many people who had&#xD;
      cancer treatment since March 2020 may need additional support to achieve optimum physical and&#xD;
      psychological wellbeing. At present, people with cancer in Ireland are not given the&#xD;
      opportunity to have an individual assessment of their physical and psychological wellbeing as&#xD;
      part of standard care and are not routinely prescribed exercise-based rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To run and evaluate an exercise-based rehabilitation triage and assessment clinic for&#xD;
      people who had cancer treatment since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were diagnosed with cancer in St James Hospital since March 2020 will be invited&#xD;
      to participate in the study. Participants will attend an appointment with a physiotherapist,&#xD;
      who will assess their physical and mental wellbeing. On the basis of the assessment findings,&#xD;
      participants will be assigned to one of three categories, which will determine their ongoing&#xD;
      rehabilitation plan. The three categories are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants who are currently active and have no cancer-specific impairments will&#xD;
           receive advice from the physiotherapist on maintaining their current levels of activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants who are not active and have no cancer-specific impairments will be referred&#xD;
           to a suitable community-based exercise programme. This programme must contain both&#xD;
           resistance and aerobic training and should have some level of supervision from a fitness&#xD;
           professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants who are not active and have ongoing cancer-specific impairments will be&#xD;
           referred to an oncology specialist physiotherapist, funded through this work, at St&#xD;
           James's Hospital for assessment and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will also be advised to visit a website designed by the PERCS research group&#xD;
      through a co-design process with patient representatives (www.cancerrehabilitation.ie.)&#xD;
      Participants will receive a follow-up phone call one week after the first assessment and will&#xD;
      then be re-assessed 12 weeks after the first assessment. A further follow-up phone call will&#xD;
      be conducted, if the PERCS research team feel it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment and triage clinic will be assessed using a framework for evaluating&#xD;
      intervention; this will look at how the intervention was implemented and how it will best&#xD;
      operate in future practice.&#xD;
