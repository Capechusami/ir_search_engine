  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish a deep learning system of various ocular fundus disease analytics based on the&#xD;
      results of multimodal examination images. The system can analyze multimodal ocular fundus&#xD;
      images, make diagnoses and generate corresponding reports.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ocular fundus is the only part of the human body that can directly see the blood vessel&#xD;
      microcirculation and nerve tissue. Through various imaging tests, including Color Fundus&#xD;
      Photograph (CFP), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Fluorescein Fundus Angiography (FFA)&#xD;
      and Indocyanine Green Angiography (ICGA), etc., it is possible to statically overview or&#xD;
      dynamically observe the retina and choroid, the condition of blood vessels and nerves, and&#xD;
      comprehensive diagnosis of the disease. The screening, interpreting and accurate diagnosis of&#xD;
      ocular fundus diseases are crucial for disease prevention, control and precise treatment.&#xD;
      However, due to the variety of fundus examination methods, and the complexity and&#xD;
      professionalism of the examination, there is a lack of fundus specialists who have sufficient&#xD;
      clinical experience and knowledge to interpret fundus examinations. With the continuous&#xD;
      development of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosing fundus diseases, various modalities&#xD;
      of imaging examination methods are gradually applied to the development of fundus disease&#xD;
      diagnosis systems. Moreover, medical images often come with corresponding reports, which are&#xD;
      mostly generated by clinicians' or radiologists' experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, we are establishing a fundus disease diagnosis and report-generating system based on&#xD;
      cross-modal ocular fundus imaging examinations, and fundus lesions were visualized at the&#xD;
      same time. Multi-center data verification will also be conducted. The results of the research&#xD;
      will assist in fundus lesions diagnosis and imaging reports generation. We hope this could&#xD;
      popularize more complex fundus imaging examination methods to society, and help improve the&#xD;
      early diagnosis and treatment of fundus lesions that cause blindness.&#xD;
