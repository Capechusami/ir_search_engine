    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between the dental plaque indices&#xD;
      measured different imaging systems and conventional clinical indices that assess dental&#xD;
      plaque. From among the patients who visited Marmara University, Faculty of Dentistry 30&#xD;
      adults between the age of 18-30, who had under 3 DMFT scores, were selected for full-mouth&#xD;
      imaging. Digital dental photography, digital scanning system and fluorecam methods were used&#xD;
      for taking intraoral images. The Turesky Modified Quigley Hein Plaque Index (TMQHPI) was&#xD;
      scored both by the clinical examination method and on the images taken. The correlations&#xD;
      between the clinical examinaton, digital photography, digital scanning system and fluorecam&#xD;
      scores were analyzed. Maxillary and mandibulary anterior teeth's buccal surfaces were scored&#xD;
      to TMQHPI after using disclosing agent.&#xD;

      The study was performed with 30 adult patients aged between 18-35, recruited from among the&#xD;
      outpatients who visited the Marmara University, Faculty of Dentistry, Restorative Dentistry&#xD;
      Department, agreed to the terms of the experiment, had a DMFT score 3 or lower, and had&#xD;
      relatively even teeth arrangement. Among patients, those with orthodontic bracket placed,&#xD;
      severe crowding of teeth not visually verified in the photograph, fixed or implant&#xD;
      restoration installed, more than 3 DMFT score, and serious systemic diseases were excluded&#xD;
      from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to standardize the study, the volunteers were informed that they shouldn't eat any&#xD;
      nutrients and do oral hygiene practices after dinner. Visualization of plaque samples formed&#xD;
      in the mouth at least 8-12 hours between 08:30 and 10:00 a.m. in the morning and collecting&#xD;
      dental plaque samples for microbiological examination were performed after the volunteers&#xD;
      signed the informed consent form. The Turesky Modified Quigley Hein Plaque Index (TMQHPI) was&#xD;
      scored both by the clinical examination method and on the images taken. The correlations&#xD;
      between the manuel examinaton, digital photography, digital scanning system and fluorecam&#xD;
      scores were analyzed. Maxillary and mandibulary anterior teeth's buccal surfaces were scored&#xD;
      to TMQHPI after using disclosing agent. Using the standard toothbrush provided to the&#xD;
      volunteers, they were asked to brush their teeth twice a day for 21 days with the recommended&#xD;
      brushing method. After 21 days, dental plaque scoring and imaging procedure was repeated and&#xD;
      dental plaque samples were collected again and placed in Eppendorf tubes. Eppendorf tubes&#xD;
      were kept at -80 Â°C during the study. Bacterial changes in the samples taken on Day 0 and Day&#xD;
      21 were examined by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method in Marmara University Faculty of&#xD;
      Medicine, Department of Clinical Microbiology. The levels in plaque samples of Streptococcus&#xD;
      mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinomyces viscosus, , Candida albicans, Staphylococcus&#xD;
      aerus, were measured.&#xD;
