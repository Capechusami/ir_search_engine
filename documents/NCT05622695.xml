  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac remote monitoring devices have expanded our ability to track physiological changes&#xD;
      used in the diagnosis and management of patients with cardiac disease. Implantable remote&#xD;
      monitoring technologies have been shown to predict heart failure events, and guide therapy to&#xD;
      reduce heart failure hospitalizations. The CardioMEMs System, the most studied and&#xD;
      established remote monitoring system, relies on a pulmonary artery implant for continuous PAP&#xD;
      measurement. However, there are no commercially available wearable systems that can reproduce&#xD;
      continuous PAP tracings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine if a machine-learning algorithm with data from a wearable&#xD;
      cardiac remote-monitoring system incorporating EKG, heart sounds, and thoracic impedance can&#xD;
      reproduce a continuous PAP tracing obtained during right heart catheterization.&#xD;

    <description>Swan-Ganz catheterization (also called right heart catheterization or pulmonary artery catheterization) is the passing of a thin tube (catheter) into the right side of the heart and the arteries leading to the lungs. It is done to monitor the heart's function and blood flow and pressures in and around the heart.</description>
