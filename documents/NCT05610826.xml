    <textblock>
      Doctors and researchers leading this study hope to learn more about peptide receptor&#xD;
      radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in combination with cytoreduction (surgically removing tumors).&#xD;
      They hope to learn if combining PRRT in combination with cytoreduction would be more&#xD;
      effective than cytoreduction alone. PRRT itself is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for people with PanNETs however the combination with cytoreduction is&#xD;
      considered experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this research will last about 2 years. The purpose of this research is&#xD;
      to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of PRRT.&#xD;

      Your participation in this research will last about 2 years. The purpose of this research is&#xD;
      to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of PRRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRRT is a form of targeted treatment (think of a &quot;lock and key&quot;) done by the use of a small&#xD;
      molecule (Lutathera) Lutathera acts as a &quot;key&quot; to &quot;lock&quot; onto certain areas your tumor cells&#xD;
      called receptors when injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. Lutetium-177&#xD;
      is the radionuclide in Lutathera which is a chemical that delivers strong radiation directly&#xD;
      into your tumor cells and works by causing death of the cancerous tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRRT can only be done on patients who have tumors that have the somatostatin receptors.&#xD;
      Before being given PRRT, your treating doctor will run imaging tests to make sure your tumors&#xD;
      have these targeted receptors. Your participation in this research will last about 2 years.&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      PRRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized (like the flip of a coin) to one of two arms. Arm 1 is the&#xD;
      control arm, which will undergo standard of care cytoreductive surgery (for the tumor). Arm 2&#xD;
      will undergo four cycles of PRRT before cytoreductive surgery.&#xD;

    <description>PRRT is a molecular targeted therapy used to treat neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Molecular targeted therapies use drugs or other substances to identify and attack cancer cells while reducing harm to healthy tissue. PRRT delivers high doses of radiation to tumors in the body to destroy or slow their growth and reduce disease side effects.</description>
