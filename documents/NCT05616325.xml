  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, single-center, longitudinal cohort study. In order to evaluate the&#xD;
      gonadotoxicity of chemotherapy, an AMH monitoring was initiated in 2006 in our fertility&#xD;
      observatory in young patients with lymphoma before, during and after chemotherapy. This study&#xD;
      is part of the project &quot;She will get better and then want a child&quot; and is supported by the&#xD;
      ARS hauts de France (n° DOS/SDES/AR/FIR/2019/282). Our first study published in 2010 shows&#xD;
      that AMH decreases sharply during chemotherapy, regardless of the chemotherapy protocol. At&#xD;
      the end of chemotherapy, AMH recovery profiles differ according to the protocol received.&#xD;
      This follow-up is therefore essential in order to adapt our practices and our preservation&#xD;
      strategies, particularly to the type of chemotherapy. Patients are primarily concerned about&#xD;
      their chances of subsequent pregnancy, and there is little evidence in the literature about&#xD;
      the impact of chemotherapy on ovarian reserve and long-term fertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fisrt objective of our study is to evaluate, at distance from chemotherapy, the evolution&#xD;
      of ovarian function in patients treated for lymphoma by evaluating follicular reserve&#xD;
      parameters (AMH and antral follicle count) at 5 and 10 years after the end of chemotherapy&#xD;
      compared with the initial workup performed before chemotherapy and the workup performed at 12&#xD;
      months after the end of chemotherapy.&#xD;
