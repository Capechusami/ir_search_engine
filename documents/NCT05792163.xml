  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of approximately 86 healthy male and female adult participants between 18 and 55&#xD;
      years of age, inclusive, will be enrolled in this study, that will be conducted in 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1-Single Ascending Dose (SAD) and Part 2 -Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD). Part 1 is&#xD;
      subdivided into Part 1a and Part 1b. Part 1b is a cohort for cerebrospinal fluid sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 6 cohorts planned for Part 1a SAD, 1 cohort for Part 1b SAD and 3 cohorts for Part&#xD;
      2 MAD.&#xD;

             by) the Investigator and Sponsor is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any concomitant disease, condition, or treatment that could interfere with the conduct&#xD;
