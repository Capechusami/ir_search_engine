      In this single center , retrospective study, 5355 covid patient were selected from 2020 to&#xD;
      2022, with recorded blood pressure before covid and recording after covid. Blood pressure&#xD;
      before and after covid were compared, by pair T test.&#xD;

      design and participants This single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted at an&#xD;
      outpatient cardiology clinic in Shiraz, Iran, between February 15, 2020, and December 28,&#xD;
      2022. We evaluated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by RNA reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction&#xD;
      assays from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab specimens according to World Health&#xD;
      Organization guidelines (12). Two physicians (PA, MY) reviewed the patients' electronic&#xD;
      medical records, including demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, treatments, and&#xD;
      outcomes. Ambiguities were resolved by a third author (MM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study included all COVID-19 patients who had at least one documented blood&#xD;
      pressure measurement in the three months preceding infection and one documented measurement&#xD;
      one to three months following recovery. The following patients were excluded: those under 18,&#xD;
      with hospital admission due to COVID-19, who received corticosteroid therapy, those with a&#xD;
      history of systemic inflammatory disease, kidney or liver, immunocompromised patients, and&#xD;
      those who switched their antihypertensive regimen during the study. Finally, 5,355 eligible&#xD;
      patients were investigated . The primary outcome was to assess BP variation following&#xD;
      infection (particularly a prolonged rise in BP) among non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome was to identify the predictor factors of BP variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of Medical&#xD;
      Sciences under code IR.SUMS.MED.REC.1401.465 , and the need for informed consent was waived&#xD;
      due to the study's retrospective nature and the absence of patient identifiers in the&#xD;
      presented data.&#xD;
