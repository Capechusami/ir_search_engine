  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the mechanism of action and our previous pilot data, the primary aim of the present&#xD;
      study is to examine the efficacy and safety of 8-week treatment with tolcapone vs. placebo in&#xD;
      adults with moderate to severe OCD, as indicated by a score of at least 21 on the Yale Brown&#xD;
      Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), a scale of illness severity, at the baseline visit. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that tolcapone will significantly improve symptoms of OCD compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim of the proposed study is to examine the cognitive effects of tolcapone in&#xD;
      OCD, by conducting objective neuropsychological tasks pre- and post-pharmacological trial.&#xD;
      The rationale for this approach is that: dopamine plays a key role in cognition; cognitive&#xD;
      effects of tolcapone are likely to be relevant in explaining symptomatic effects; and&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction constitutes an important treatment target in OCD that is not generally&#xD;
      ameliorated by current first-line interventions. We hypothesize that any symptomatic benefit&#xD;
      with tolcapone would also be associated with improvement in executive functions including&#xD;
      cognitive flexibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another secondary aim of the proposed study is to evaluate whether the single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphism (SNP) Val-158-Met polymorphism significantly relates to changes in symptoms and&#xD;
      cognition observed with tolcapone. Prior data indicate cognitive effects of tolcapone are&#xD;
      affected by this SNP. We hypothesize that the val/val COMT variant will be associated with&#xD;
      significantly higher tolcapone-related improvements in cognition and symptoms, since this is&#xD;
      linked to lower cortical dopamine function.&#xD;
