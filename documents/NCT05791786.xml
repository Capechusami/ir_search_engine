      To establish a clinical registry of suspected cases of AFE. The existing registry will be&#xD;
      migrated to a new platform,&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The registry and the biorepository have prospective and retrospective components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective component of the registry and the biorepository focuses on the collection of&#xD;
      demographic, clinical, and biological material of patients prospectively identified as having&#xD;
      the AFE syndrome, including the collection of future samples from survivors and related&#xD;
      individuals. Typically, healthcare providers, family members of an affected patient, or&#xD;
      patients themselves contact the AFE Foundation. The AFE Foundation provides information about&#xD;
      the natural history of the syndrome and its outcomes and invites patients to participate in&#xD;
      the registry and biorepository. The AFE Foundation obtains informed consent from patients or&#xD;
      next of kin for enrollment in this observational study. There is no randomization or placebo&#xD;
      group for this registry as it is exclusively an observational study. If maternal specimens&#xD;
      are available pre- and post-event during the hospital admission for delivery, these samples&#xD;
      will also be collected from each patient. The only group assignment will be the subjects with&#xD;
      a diagnosis of AFE and the subjects' family members including the partner(s) and child&#xD;
      (children).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrospective component of the registry consists of obtaining clinical information and&#xD;
      biological material from patients who have been previously affected by the AFE syndrome. This&#xD;
      objective includes obtaining medical records, patient-provided information, pathology&#xD;
      reports, autopsy reports, and tissue blocks. Biological samples can also be obtained from&#xD;
      survivors and relatives to determine whether there are biomarkers in previously affected&#xD;
      patients or whether biomarkers can be elicited from the stimulation of peripheral blood&#xD;
      cells. In addition to collecting data and specimens from the patients that are consented and&#xD;
      enrolled through the registry, a query of all maternal deaths within 24 hours of birth&#xD;
      between 1/2012 to 1/2023 will be performed at the Hermann Hospital system to identify if any&#xD;
      of these deaths occurred secondary to AFE. The investigators intend to perform a detailed&#xD;
      chart review and collect otherwise discarded tissue if available from the respective hospital&#xD;
      to perform special immunohistochemistry staining among women who underwent autopsy.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria for participants of the AFE registry and biorepository include affected&#xD;
        individuals diagnosed with AFE (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects or their next of kin must be able to provide a signed and dated informed&#xD;
             consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the case of lethal AFE, the surviving family member or next of kin must be able to&#xD;
             provide a signed and dated informed consent form with an accompanying death&#xD;
             certificate and proof of legal kinship.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants are expected to be willing to permit collection of data about their&#xD;
             affected pregnancy, previous and future pregnancies, and their current and future&#xD;
             health conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Providing biological samples is not required for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any maternal death in the Hermann Hospital System suspected of having an AFE within 24&#xD;
             hours of childbirth between 1/2012 and 1/2023 will also be included for data analysis&#xD;
             and biospecimen studies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical records will be abstracted into a comprehensive case report form and then&#xD;
             reviewed by a team of three experts with consensus to determine case classification of&#xD;
             three categories, according to criteria previously reported and based on data&#xD;
             generated from the previously existing registry:&#xD;
&#xD;
             (1) Classic AFE is defined by the following indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute hypotension or cardiac arrest,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute hypoxia, defined as dyspnea, cyanosis, or respiratory arrest,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Coagulopathy, defined as laboratory evidence of intravascular consumption or&#xD;
             fibrinolysis or severe clinical hemorrhage in the absence of other explanations,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Onset of the above during labor, cesarean section, or dilation and evacuation or&#xD;
             within 30 minutes post-partum, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of any other significant confounding condition or potential explanation for&#xD;
             the signs and symptoms observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             (2) Not AFE:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anything that clinically appears to be a likely result of another pathophysiology,&#xD;
             e.g., delayed treatment of postpartum hemorrhage from uterine atony.&#xD;
&#xD;
             (3) Atypical AFE:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjective determination by the chart reviewer that lies between &quot;classic&quot; and &quot;not,&quot;&#xD;
             e.g., the patient presents some of the registry criteria and no other explanation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             (4) Indeterminate: There is not sufficient information to classify in 1-3 above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The classification of AFE is for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The inability of an individual to provide a signed and dated informed consent form or&#xD;
             those who do not wish to participate.&#xD;
