  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to explore the efficacy of a text message based safety behavior&#xD;
      fadinig intervention compared to an unhealthy behavior fading intervention for appearance&#xD;
      concerns.&#xD;

      Description: Appearance-related safety behavior fading intervention procedures will follow&#xD;
      methodology previously used in the Cougle Lab. The safety behavior fading intervention is&#xD;
      designed to target a decrease or elimination of appearance-related safety behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals randomly assigned to the safety behavior fading condition will receive&#xD;
      instructions to decrease or eliminate their endorsed appearance-related safety behaviors. In&#xD;
      addition, they will receive daily reminders via text message to decrease these behaviors,&#xD;
      along with a safety behavior monitoring checklist in which the participant indicates the&#xD;
      extent to which they decreased and/or eliminated each safety behavior over the previous day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals randomly assigned to the unhealthy behavior fading condition will receive&#xD;
      instructions to decrease or eliminate unhealthy behaviors. They will also receive daily&#xD;
      reminders via text message to decrease these behaviors, along with a safety behavior&#xD;
      monitoring checklist in which the participant indicates the extent to which they decreased&#xD;
      and/or eliminated each safety behavior over the previous day.&#xD;
