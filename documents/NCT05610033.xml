  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PIONEER EV PACING Study is prospective, multi-center, acute (in-hospital), single-arm,&#xD;
      pilot study. The study objective is to characterize preliminary safety and performance of the&#xD;
      AtaCor EV Temporary Pacing Lead System when used as intended for clinical use as a temporary&#xD;
      pacing lead.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary safety endpoint is freedom from Adverse Device Effects, CTCAE Grade 3 or higher.&#xD;
      The primary performance endpoint is percentage of Subjects with demonstrated pacing capture&#xD;
      following lead fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled at up to three (3) investigation centers. Enrolled&#xD;
      subjects will undergo insertion of a StealthTrac Lead within one calendar day of an eligible&#xD;
      planned index procedure that requires a temporary pacing lead. Echocardiographic evaluations&#xD;
      will be performed before and after StealthTrac Lead insertion, as well as after the index&#xD;
      procedure, to assess for pericardial effusion. Post-operative fluoroscopic images are&#xD;
      required in all subjects to document the final lead position. In subjects without an&#xD;
      underlying ventricular escape rhythm, a concomitant, commercially available pacing lead is&#xD;
      required. Lead measurements (Thresholds, Impedance, R-Waves) and an insertion procedure&#xD;
      survey will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be restricted to bed rest while the StealthTrac lead remains inserted. The&#xD;
      StealthTrac Lead will be connected to a commercially available, constant-current temporary&#xD;
      pacemaker programmed by the investigator to provide temporary pacing support. The StealthTrac&#xD;
      Lead will remain inserted until the next calendar day, at a minimum, and will be removed once&#xD;
      the clinical need for temporary pacing ends. The maximum duration of lead insertion is two&#xD;
      (2) days following the lead insertion procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up evaluations will be performed for as long as the StealthTrac Lead remains inserted.&#xD;
      Subjects will also undergo a 30-day post-removal follow-up before completing participation.&#xD;
      On the final follow-up, prior to StealthTrac Lead removal, Subjects may be tested in multiple&#xD;
      postures. Subjects with pacing capture in the upright posture may have ECGs recorded during&#xD;
      various isometrics or while walking with pacing from the StealthTrac Lead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to removal, a final lead evaluation will be performed and fluoroscopy will be used to&#xD;
      document the final lead position. Echocardiographic imaging will be obtained before and after&#xD;
      the removal procedure to characterize any new or worsened pericardial effusions. A final&#xD;
      post-removal follow-up will be performed in person or remotely to document any latent adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall study is expected to last four (4) months, comprising two (2) months for&#xD;
      enrollment and follow-up and two (2) months to monitor study data and prepare a final report.&#xD;
