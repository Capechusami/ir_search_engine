  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common condition affecting the liver,&#xD;
      owing to its association with obesity and the metabolic syndrome. The largest study to date&#xD;
      using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify liver triglyceride (TG) content showed that&#xD;
      approximately 33% of individuals have hepatic steatosis. NAFLD encompasses a continuum of&#xD;
      histological findings that starts with steatosis that can progress to nonalcoholic&#xD;
      steatohepatitis (NASH), which is characterized by inflammation and cell death, and eventually&#xD;
      cirrhosis. Given the large number of individuals afflicted with this condition, there is a&#xD;
      clear need to develop effective and safe therapies to treat NAFLD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with NAFLD were recruited in the current study and divided into NAFLD group, and&#xD;
      NASH group. The researchers will collect various clinical examination indexes of the subjects&#xD;
      in the process of diagnosis and treatment, including but not limited to ALT, AST, TG, TC,&#xD;
      etc. Characteristic and prognosis of patients will be recorded. The serum, feces, urine and&#xD;
      liver (if necessary) samples of all subjects will be taken after enrollment and stored for&#xD;
      probably testing in the future. This study has no additional intervention and treatment for&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
