      The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of using ketotifen in&#xD;
      patients with NAFLD patients without cirrhosis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by the accumulation and deposition&#xD;
      of fats in the hepatocytes which affect the liver structure and function. Causes of NAFLD&#xD;
      vary but mainly attributed to dyslipidemia and obesity. Prevalence of NAFLD has been raised&#xD;
      over years from 25% in 2005 to over 37% in 2016 and continues to increase to become one of&#xD;
      the most common chronic liver disease (Li J et al., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease progress from steatosis and inflammatory infiltration that is known as&#xD;
      nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and ultimately&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite these serious outcomes, no definitive known approved&#xD;
      medication for NASH has been developed. NAFLD management is mainly dependent on diet control,&#xD;
      physical activity, and some supportive treatments mainly to prevent the disease complications&#xD;
      (Mundi et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mast cells (MCs) are responsible releasing mediators, including preformed bioactive&#xD;
      metabolites (histamine and tryptase,), newly synthesized cytokines [transforming growth&#xD;
      factor beta (TGF-β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (Pham et al., 2022). MCs can lead to&#xD;
      microvesicular steatosis, ductal reaction (DR), biliary senescence, inflammation,&#xD;
      angiogenesis, and liver fibrosis during NAFLD/NASH (Huang et al., 2022). Consequently, MC&#xD;
      stabilizer such as ketotifen has emerged as promising approach to improve patients with NASH&#xD;
      through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (Kim et al., 2014; Abdelzaher et al.,&#xD;
      2020).&#xD;
