  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elastic Tension Digital Neoprene Orthosis is a new device that can increase the dose of&#xD;
      treatment of the proximal interphalangeal flexion contractures. This treatment improved the&#xD;
      results in extension and also reducing the time to obtain it.&#xD;

      Question: In fingers with proximal interphalangeal joint flexion contractures, do significant&#xD;
      differences exist between the passive range of motion improvement achieved in joints that&#xD;
      receive higher doses of daily total end range time compared to those that receive lower doses&#xD;
      of daily total end range time?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized parallel-group trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding and&#xD;
      intention-to-treat&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Fifty-seven fingers in fifty patients suffering a proximal interphalangeal&#xD;
      joint flexion contracture&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The treatment consisted of an exercise program in conjunction with the use of&#xD;
      an extension elastic tension digital neoprene orthosis to generate extension. Researchers&#xD;
      applied two different daily total end range time doses. Group A patients used the orthosis&#xD;
      with a dose of twenty to twenty-two hours of daily total end range time while group B&#xD;
      patients used the elastic tension digital neoprene orthosis to achieve a daily total end&#xD;
      range time between eleven and thirteen hours. The exercise program was the same for both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The researchers performed the goniometric measurements manually twice at&#xD;
      the beginning of every session during the three-week period. The first measurement was at the&#xD;
      patient arrival after a preconditioning and the second was after twenty minutes. This&#xD;
      measurement at the first session was included as a Modified weeks test while at the second,&#xD;
      third and forth session was recorded as a contraction test. Patient report of orthosis wear&#xD;
      time and&#xD;
