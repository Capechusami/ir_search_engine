  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      : CP is a neurodevelopmental condition. A set of irreversible impairments of movement and&#xD;
      posture development, resulting in activity limitation. Acquired CP can be the outcome of a&#xD;
      variety of issues that arise after the first 28 days of a baby's existence. A CP diagnosis&#xD;
      can now be made as early as 16 weeks. speech-language pathologists (SLPs) began collaborating&#xD;
      with OTs and PTs for Infants and toddlers who also struggle with speech impediments, feeding&#xD;
      and swallowing disorder. Oral motor exercises (OMEs), also known as &quot;mouth exercises,&quot;&#xD;
      &quot;non-speech oral motor training,&quot; and &quot;oral motor treatment&quot; were designed for their&#xD;
      treatment. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of oral motor exercises in&#xD;
      children with cerebral palsy having feeding and swallowing difficulties.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 17 million people throughout the world are living with cerebral palsy (CP), making it&#xD;
      the most common physical disability among children. CP is a neurodevelopmental condition[1].&#xD;
      Cerebral palsy is a fitting classification of the condition and its associated deficits&#xD;
      because the word cerebral means &quot;pertaining to the brain&quot; and palsy means &quot;loss of muscle&#xD;
      control.&quot; A set of irreversible impairments of movement and posture development, resulting in&#xD;
      activity limitation, that are linked to non-progressive disruptions that occurred in the&#xD;
      developing foetus or infant brain, was chosen as the official definition of CP in 2005 by the&#xD;
      International Consensus [2]. It's important to keep in mind that the phrase &quot;cerebral palsy&quot;&#xD;
      refers to a spectrum of conditions, each of which has its own unique appearance, set of&#xD;
      symptoms, and prevalence rate within the general population. In addition to the&#xD;
      musculoskeletal and neurological symptoms of CP, epilepsy and other sensory and cognitive&#xD;
      impairments are also common&#xD;

    <masking_description>All patients of study were screened for following information before randomization such as age, gender, location duration of disease and medical history. Each participant of current study was undergoing through questionnaire regarding demographic information. For oral motor therapy assessment and the Functional Feeding Assessment (FFA) subscale of the multidisciplinary Feeding Profile (MFP) were used. A blinded pedagogue who was not involve in the training sessions performed the Bayley scales of infant development (BSID-II) before and after the training.</masking_description>

    <description>These are exercises designed to increase the range of movement in tongue, lips, and jaw, which helped in speech and/or swallow functioning. It is important to move the designated area as far as can in each direction until feel the muscles stretch. Stop if feel any pain, and mention it to speech therapist or doctor. Practice these exercises, once through, 10 times a day.</description>

Pre-language skills (vocalizations) manual sign languages, gestures, picture communication boards, voice output communication devices were used. Playing and talking, using pictures, books, objects, or ongoing events to help language development. Use of repetition exercises to build speech and language skills.</description>
