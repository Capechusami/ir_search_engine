  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Eisenmenger syndrome corresponds to the most advanced form of pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension associated with congenital heart disease. The syndrome causes chronic hypoxemia,&#xD;
      with an increase in erythrocyte mass, which predisposes to thrombotic complications.&#xD;
      Pentoxifylline is a xanthine derivative and it is considered as a hemorrheological agent with&#xD;
      described effects of reduction in erythrocyte and platelet aggregation, adhesion and&#xD;
      activation of leukocytes, and endothelial damage. The main objective of this study is to&#xD;
      verify if the chronic oral administration of pentoxifylline to Eisenmenger patients induces&#xD;
      an increase in the circulating levels of thrombomodulin, a naturally occurring proteoglycan&#xD;
      with anticoagulant, anti thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Eisenmenger syndrome corresponds to the most advanced form of pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension associated with congenital heart disease. The syndrome causes chronic hypoxemia,&#xD;
      with an increase in erythrocyte mass, which predisposes to thrombotic complications. It also&#xD;
      involves endothelial dysfunction characterized by increase in the circulating levels of von&#xD;
      Willebrand factor, tissue-type plasminogen activator and P-selectin, with a reduction in the&#xD;
      plasma concentration of thrombomodulin. The usual drug treatment is represented by the use of&#xD;
      prostanoids, endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and, eventually,&#xD;
      anticoagulation with warfarin. However, the difficulty of controlling the chronic use of&#xD;
      warfarin and the few studies with other oral anticoagulants, brings the possibility of using&#xD;
      drugs not specifically designated as coagulation inhibitors, such as pentoxifylline. This&#xD;
      drug is a xanthine derivative and it is considered as a hemorrheological agent with described&#xD;
      effects of reduction in erythrocyte and platelet aggregation, adhesion and activation of&#xD;
      leukocytes, and endothelial damage. It is, therefore, considered as an agent capable of&#xD;
      reducing blood viscosity and improving erythrocyte deformability probably due to an increase&#xD;
      in intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), with a reduction in Ca++ and phosphorylation&#xD;
      of membrane proteins. The objective of this study is to verify if the chronic oral&#xD;
      administration of pentoxifylline: 1) induces an increase in the circulating levels of&#xD;
      thrombomodulin, a naturally occurring proteoglycan with anticoagulant, anti thrombotic and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory properties; 2) stabilizes or induces a reduction in circulating tissue&#xD;
      factor and thrombin-antithrombin complexes; 3) changes the expression of thrombomodulin and&#xD;
      tissue factor in circulating monocytes; 4) offers protection against the occurrence of&#xD;
      predefined clinical events; 5) provides improvement in physical capacity, peripheral oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, hematocrit level and right ventricular function. The main study outcome is&#xD;
      biochemical: change from baseline (increase) in circulating levels of thrombomodulin at 3&#xD;
      months and 6 months of oral use of pentoxifylline. It will be a prospective, single-center,&#xD;
      randomized study. Forty-eight adult patients with Eisenmenger syndrome who are already using&#xD;
      specific therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension will be included and these will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive pentoxifylline as an adjunctive treatment or remain under routine&#xD;
      therapeutic measures for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Oral pentoxifylline will be started&#xD;
      at the dose of 400 mg/day for 30 days, followed by 800 mg/day for 5 months, completing the&#xD;
      6-month period of the study. The routine treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension will&#xD;
      be maintained for all patients.&#xD;
