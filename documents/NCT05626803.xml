    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two monovalent Norovirus&#xD;
      (NoV) oral tableted vaccine candidates, VXA-G1.1-NN and VXA-GII.4-NS co-administered&#xD;
      (bivalent delivery) against a matching placebo arm. Bivalent GI.1 and GII.4 vaccines are&#xD;
      being investigated for the prevention of noroviral gastroenteritis caused by norovirus GI.1&#xD;
      and GII.4.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Norovirus infections are a leading cause of sporadic and epidemic gastroenteritis across all&#xD;
      age groups worldwide. This study is designed as a standard double-blind placebo-controlled&#xD;
      single administration, dose ranging study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 2&#xD;
      different doses of VXA-GII.4-NS plus VXA-G1.1-NN (high and medium dose administered orally&#xD;
      for the prevention of Norovirus infection), compared with a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll 10 sentinel subjects in an open label period (dosing staggered to&#xD;
      not-more-than 2 subjects per 24 hours) and randomize 125 subjects in three arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 10 sentinel subjects will receive the open label high dose of active vaccine. If no&#xD;
      dose-related toxicities are observed, and upon the recommendation of the SMC following review&#xD;
      of safety data, subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of the 3 study arms to&#xD;
      receive active vaccine or placebo. After vaccination on Day 1, the study will include an&#xD;
      Active Study Period that runs through 4 weeks after administration (Day 29), and a Follow-up&#xD;
      Period of one year for safety and duration of immune response.&#xD;
