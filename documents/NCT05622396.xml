  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility (primary objective) and the&#xD;
      effects (secondary objectives) of an Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program&#xD;
      adapted specifically for patients with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Parkinson's disease (PD) the psychological distress (anxiety and depression), is&#xD;
      particularly impacting and often resistant to conventional drug treatment explaining the&#xD;
      growing interest of patients in non-drug methods, such as mindfulness meditation. The&#xD;
      Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program has been evaluated in Parkinson's disease,&#xD;
      showing main effects on anxiety and depression symptoms. These data remain, however, still&#xD;
      fragile, particularly in terms of methodological robustness and number of patients involved&#xD;
      and variable size of effects. A clinical trial was recently conducted at the Bordeaux&#xD;
      University Hospital with 28 patients with Parkinson's disease . Preliminary results suggest&#xD;
      that a program tailored specifically to the expectations and needs of patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease could, optimize accessibility, acceptability, and patient compliance for&#xD;
      this type of approach while preserving clinical efficacy on anxiety and depression.&#xD;

    <description>Inspired by the standard Mindfulness Based Stress Reductio program, the study MAdaPARK is a 8 week program with weekly sessions of 2h30 and a full day of practice designed from the analysis of the post-program interviews carried out as part of the M-PARK study,as well as the reflections of the working group specially set up for this purpose. Several areas of adaptation have been identified: shorter mediations, a break time during the sessions, more times for exchanges, a more developed practice in movement, and finally, more important work based on self-esteem and self-compassion.</description>
