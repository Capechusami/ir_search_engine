      Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a widely used therapeutic resource in neonatal intensive care&#xD;
      unit (NICU); however prolonged MV is known to be associated with serious complications&#xD;
      including ventilator associated pneumonia, blood stream infections, bronchopulmonary&#xD;
      dysplasia (BPD) and periventricular leukomalacia. At the same time, extubation failure&#xD;
      increases morbidities and mortality. Hatch et al (2016) in their prospective study on 162&#xD;
      infants described adverse events in 40% of intubations and severe complications including&#xD;
      need for CPR in 9%. Reintubations are frequently associated with hypoxemia, bradycardia,&#xD;
      fluctuations in blood pressures and cerebral perfusion. Each intubation attempt increases the&#xD;
      risk of traumatic injury to the upper airway, lung atelectasis and infections. Thus, there is&#xD;
      a clear need to establish objective criteria that would help avoid extubation failure and the&#xD;
      need for reintubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently used criteria for extubation are subjective and based on clinical evaluation, chest&#xD;
      radiograph findings, amount of ventilatory support and arterial blood gas (ABG) parameters.&#xD;
      An accurate bedside test for extubation readiness in preterm infants born is even more&#xD;
      important as this population is more susceptible to the complications of re-intubation. There&#xD;
      are several studies that showed that reintubation after elective extubation is independently&#xD;
      associated with increased likelihood of death and BPD in extremely preterm infants. The&#xD;
      greatest risks are attributable to reintubation within the first 48 hours post-extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that a low lung volume and small chest radiograph lung area after&#xD;
      extubation could predict extubation failure. Infants who have a low lung volume after&#xD;
      extubation may have an unfavourable balance between respiratory muscle strength and&#xD;
      respiratory load. Ideally, these infants should be identified before removal of the&#xD;
      endotracheal tube.&#xD;
