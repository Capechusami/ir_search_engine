      To correlate fetal Pulmonary artery Doppler parameters with neonatal outcome in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertensive disorders include gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, chronic hypertension,&#xD;
      preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension. They complicate up to 10% of pregnancies.&#xD;
      As a group they are one member of the deadly triad, along with hemorrhage and infection, that&#xD;
      contributes greatly to maternal morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preeclampsia, either alone or superimposed on chronic hypertension, is the most dangerous.&#xD;
      Most hypertension related deaths are preventable. Also, nonsevere preeclampsia may progress&#xD;
      rapidly to severe disease causing headache or visual disturbance that precede eclampsia. They&#xD;
      also cause epigastic or right upper quadrant pain and elevated hepatic transaminases that&#xD;
      frequently accompany hepatocellular necrosis, ischemia and edema, thrombocytopenia that&#xD;
      represents platelet activation and aggregation, microangiopathic hemolysis, renal involvement&#xD;
      and placental abruption. On the long term, preeclampsia is also associated with adverse&#xD;
      health problems including chronic hypertension, ischemic heart disease, atherosclerosis,&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity and&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Termination of pregnancy is the only known cure for preeclampsia. Moreover, expectant&#xD;
      management of preterm severe preeclampsia leads to disastrous results as increase in&#xD;
      perinatal mortality rate, placental abruption, eclampsia, renal failure, hypertensive&#xD;
      encephalopathy, intracranial hemorrhage or even rupture in hepatic hematoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early attempts have been made to predict fetal maturity on the basis antenatal&#xD;
      ultrasonographic parameters including lung characteristics, bowel pattern, placental grading,&#xD;
      the presence or absence of intraamniotic particles (vernix caseosa) and the epiphyseal&#xD;
      ossification centers appearance and enlargement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More recently, fetal pulmonary artery Doppler has been used to predict neonatal respiratory&#xD;
      rate (RDS). It was found that an elevated acceleration-to-ejection time ratio was&#xD;
      significantly associated with neonatal RDS. However such indices cannot be generalized in all&#xD;
      cases, especially those with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy who have abnormal&#xD;
      trophoblastic invasion of uterine vessels affecting fetoplacental circulation resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, no available studies have correlated fetal pulmonary artery&#xD;
      Doppler indices with neonatal outcomes in patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.&#xD;
      Presence of such signs of maturity can aid the obstetrician to choose the most appropriate&#xD;
      timing for termination especially in low income countries who have limited access to neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care units. Being cost effective and non invasive ultrasonography is used as a&#xD;
      routine obstetrics scanning tool. This study will help determine the utility of ultrasound&#xD;
      and Doppler in assessing the fetal lung maturity in such patients.&#xD;
