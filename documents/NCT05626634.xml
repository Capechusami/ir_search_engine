    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of&#xD;
      adjunctive therapy of LP352 in subjects with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies who&#xD;
      completed participation in Study LP352-201.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, multiple-dose extension clinical study is designed to&#xD;
      evaluate long-term safety of LP352 in subjects with developmental and epileptic&#xD;
      encephalopathy who completed Study LP352-201.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a Screening Period (Day -1) and a 50-week open-label Treatment Period&#xD;
      that includes a 15-day Up-titration Period (during which time subjects will titrate up to&#xD;
      their highest tolerated doses) and an open-label Maintenance Period (48 weeks). The Treatment&#xD;
      Period will be followed by a Down-titration/Taper Period (up to 15 days) and Follow-up Period&#xD;
      (14 days after completion of down-titration). The starting dose of up-titration will be 6 mg&#xD;
      TID. The target final maintenance doses are 6 mg TID, 9 mg TID, and 12 mg TID after a 15-day&#xD;
      up-titration period, if tolerated.&#xD;
