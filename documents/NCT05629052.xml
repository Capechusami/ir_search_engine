  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational patient registry is to learn how expert centers treat patients&#xD;
      with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). CTEPH is a condition in which&#xD;
      blood clots block the blood vessels in the lungs. There are currently three treatment options&#xD;
      for patients with CTEPH:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  surgery to remove blood clots from large vessels in the lungs (pulmonary endarterectomy&#xD;
           (PEA))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the use of a small balloon to unblock smaller blood vessels (balloon pulmonary&#xD;
           angioplasty (BPA))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can also receive a combination of these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main question this registry aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many patients receive a given kind of treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How do expert centers combine the different treatments?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are patients doing better after they receive a given kind of treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many patients are alive 1, 3 and 5 years after they receive a given kind of&#xD;
           treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the same treatments that they would receive if they did not&#xD;
      participate in the study. During the study, patients will visit their doctors as they would&#xD;
      do normally. The doctors will collect information on the patients' health and enter it into&#xD;
      the study database. The follow-up time will be at least 3 years for all patients.&#xD;
