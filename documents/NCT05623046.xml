  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a remotely delivered&#xD;
      intervention for civilians and service members with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) who&#xD;
      have difficulty recognizing and regulating their emotions. Post-treatment outcomes of&#xD;
      interest include emotional self-awareness and regulation, resiliency, and affective symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I proof of principle pilot study of the Building Emotional Self-awareness&#xD;
      Teletherapy (BEST) intervention will use a quasi-experimental, non-randomized, one-group&#xD;
      pretest-posttest design with a double pretest and a 3-month follow-up in approximately 40&#xD;
      participants with mTBI (~20 civilians and ~20 service members). Study objectives are to&#xD;
      explore the feasibility and early efficacy of BEST to improve psychological health outcomes&#xD;
      in civilian and Service Member (SM) participants with mTBI who have alexithymia (poor&#xD;
      emotional self-awareness) and emotion dysregulation. We anticipate BEST will have good&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability in both civilian and service member participants, and&#xD;
      post-treatment assessments will show significant improvements in alexithymia, emotion&#xD;
      regulation, resiliency, and affective symptoms.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, Week 12, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 20-item self report questionnaire comprised of three sub-constructs (Difficulty Identifying feelings, Difficulty Describing feelings, Externally-oriented Thinking). The full scale range is 20-100 (higher scores indicate higher (worse) alexithymia). Subscales are summed to compute a total score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, Week 12, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Objective, performance-based measure of emotional awareness and labeling. Short hypothetical scenarios are presented and participants are asked to describe how they and others would feel in the context of the scenarios. More discrete emotions earn more points (e.g., &quot;sad&quot; scores better than &quot;bad&quot;). Participants' responses are scored with an electronic system, removing human bias and interpretation. The LEAS has parallel forms (A and B), which will alternate at testing sessions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Difficulty with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, Week 12, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Using a 5-point Likert scale, participants rate the frequency they utilize self-regulation behaviors in response to general emotional distress. There are 6 subscales: Lack of Emotional Awareness; Lack of Emotional Clarity; Difficulties Controlling Impulsive Behaviors when Distressed; Difficulties Engaging in Goal-Directed Behavior when Distressed; Non-acceptance of Negative Emotional Responses; and Limited Access to Effective Emotion Regulation Strategies. Items are summed to provide a Total Emotion Dysregulation score. Scores range from 5 (low) to 180 (high). Higher scores are indicative of more emotion dysregulation problems. The DERS has high internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and good construct validity.</description>

Higher scores are indicative of greater resilience. Total score is determined by calculating the average across all 6 responses. Scores can then be classified as Low, Normal, or High Resilience.</description>

Using a 5-point scale, participants rate the extent to which they have experienced each mood state during a specified time frame. Subscale scores for positive and negative affect are calculated with scores ranging from 10-50. For the Positive subscale, higher score equal more positive affect. For the negative affect subscale, higher scores are indicative of more negative affect.</description>
