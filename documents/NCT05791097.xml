  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary scientific question of interest is whether the addition of ociperlimab to&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy and tislelizumab improve progression-free survival (PFS) or&#xD;
      overall survival (OS) compared to pembrolizumab and platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line&#xD;
      therapy for participants with locally advanced or metastatic squamous or non-squamous NSCLC&#xD;
      with PD-L1 expression of ≥1%.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter, phase III study&#xD;
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of ociperlimab in combination with tislelizumab and&#xD;
      platinum-based doublet chemotherapy as first-line treatment for participants with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic NSCLC without actionable driver mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment every three weeks and will continue to receive it&#xD;
      until RECIST 1.1 disease progression as determined by Investigator and confirmed by BIRC,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity that precludes further treatment, treatment is discontinued at the&#xD;
      discretion of the Investigator or participant, participant withdrawal of consent, pregnancy,&#xD;
      lost to follow-up, or death.&#xD;

    <measure>Time to definitive 10-point deterioration in physical and role functioning on the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire developed to assess the health-related quality of life of cancer participants. It assesses 15 domains consisting of 5 functional domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, social) and 9 symptom domains (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties) and a global health status/quality of life (QoL) scale. All of the domain scores range from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional scale indicates a high and healthy level of functioning but a high score for a symptom scale indicates a high level of symptoms.&#xD;
The time to definitive 10 point deterioration of physical functioning and role functioning is defined as the time from the date of randomization to first onset of ≥10 points increase from baseline (worsening) of the corresponding scale score, with no later change below this threshold or death due to any cause.</description>

    <description>The Lung Cancer module of the EORTC's quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-LC13) is used in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ-C30 and provides information on an additional 13 items specifically related to lung cancer. The lung cancer module incorporates one multi-item scale to assess dyspnea, and 9 single items assessing pain, coughing, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, and hemoptysis. All of the domain scores range from 0 to 100. A high score indicates a high level of symptoms.&#xD;
The time to first 10 point deterioration symptom scores of chest pain, cough and dyspnea is defined as the time from the date of randomization to first onset of ≥10 points increase from baseline (worsening) of the corresponding scale score, with no later change below this threshold or death due to any cause.</description>

    <description>EQ-5D-5L is a standardized participant completed questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life and translates that score into an index value or utility score. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Higher scores indicated greater levels of problems across each of the five dimensions.</description>
