      This study is evaluating music vs midazolam as a means of anxiolysis for preoperative&#xD;
      single-shot nerve block placement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative anxiety is common and can adversely affect a patient's perioperative course by&#xD;
      elevating stress markers, promoting fluctuations in hemodynamics and negatively impacting on&#xD;
      postoperative recovery. Preoperative anxiety is routinely treated with pharmacologic agents&#xD;
      such as midazolam, a benzodiazepine, which has known, undesirable side effects including&#xD;
      respiratory depression, hemodynamic perturbations, and paradoxical effects such as hostility,&#xD;
      aggression, and psychomotor agitation. The use of sedative medications requires continuous&#xD;
      vital sign monitoring of patients by either anesthesia or nursing personnel and there is a&#xD;
      question of whether midazolam helps reduce pre-procedural anxiety compared with placebo.&#xD;
      Music is a non-pharmacologic intervention that has been shown to significantly decrease&#xD;
      preoperative anxiety. This intervention can be used as an adjunct or even replace&#xD;
      pharmacologic agents to help with preoperative anxiety. Music is a modality that is virtually&#xD;
      harm-free and relatively cheap in cost. Patients who are unable to tolerate pharmacologic&#xD;
      agents to treat preoperative anxiety can greatly benefit from non-pharmacologic options such&#xD;
      as music.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional anesthesia procedures such as an ultrasound guided, peripheral nerve block is a&#xD;
      common bedside procedure done preoperatively. Patients may have some anxiety prior to the&#xD;
      administration of this nerve block procedure and may receive sedation for it. However, it is&#xD;
      imperative not to over sedate them as constant feedback from the patient is necessary during&#xD;
      the procedure. Commonly, midazolam is used to reduce this anxiety, but non-pharmacologic&#xD;
      therapies can also reduce anxiety. In our recent published study, we evaluated the use of&#xD;
      research-selected, relaxing music, to reduce anxiety before the nerve block is administered.&#xD;
      In this study, we used noise-canceling headphones and played research-selected music as our&#xD;
      anxiolytic music modality and compared this with midazolam. The findings showed no difference&#xD;
      between both groups in the change in anxiety scores from after to before the nerve block,&#xD;
      however patients had better satisfaction in the midazolam group and increased difficulty in&#xD;
      communication in the music group. We attributed this to not allowing patients to choose their&#xD;
      own selection of music and the use of noise-canceling headphones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this follow-up study, we aim to evaluate the use of patient-selected music via&#xD;
      non-noise canceling headphones as a preoperative anxiolytic prior to the administration of a&#xD;
      bedside, peripheral nerve block procedure. This study will be conducted at an ambulatory&#xD;
      surgical center in a university setting.&#xD;
