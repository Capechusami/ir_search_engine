    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: • Subjects, age 22 to 65 years, in general good health.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with diagnosed hypotrichosis of the eyebrows.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with active hair loss within the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients willing to refrain from initiation of any new vitamins or nutritional&#xD;
             supplements for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients willing to refrain from use of any hair growth therapies (oral or topical)&#xD;
             other than the investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria: • Subjects with an active disease or infection, or chronic&#xD;
        dermatological condition (eczema, psoriasis, infection, etc.) of the scalp that may&#xD;
        interfere with the assessment of scalp skin health in the treated regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hair transplants, scalp reduction, current hair weave or tattooing in the&#xD;
             target area, artificial hair coloring two months prior to initiation of study which&#xD;
             makes it difficult to perform hair count assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with hair loss for greater than 5 years, as medical therapy is unlikely to&#xD;
             have much effect at restoring hair follicles inactive for that long of a time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of chemotherapy, receiving cytotoxic agents, radiation, or&#xD;
             laser/surgical therapy of the scalp within the past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any known or underlying medical problem that could influence hair growth such as HIV&#xD;
             infection, connective tissue disease, a thyroid condition, inflammatory bowel disease&#xD;
             or other medical conditions, at the discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with clinical diagnosis of hair loss other than hypotrichosis of the&#xD;
             eyebrows.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with severe cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled or untreated hypertension,&#xD;
             arrythmia or clinically relevant hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with known or suspected hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to any of the&#xD;
             active or inactive components of the test articles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating females or planning to become pregnant for the duration of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects using medications that potentially cause drug-induced hair loss (e.g.,&#xD;
             depotestosterone, haloperidol, methotrexate, methylprednisolone, prednisone,&#xD;
             testosterone, divalproex sodium) within the last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current enrollment in any other investigational medication (drug) study within the 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to study initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or recent (2 months) history of severe diet or eating disorder.&#xD;
