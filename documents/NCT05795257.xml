  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim is to compare the composition and spatial heterogeneity of the following in&#xD;
      critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients: i) immune cell populations and their&#xD;
      activation patterns, ii) the surrounding cytokine-chemokine milieu, including&#xD;
      trans-compartmental fluxes of these mediators between the lung and bloodstream, and iii) the&#xD;
      lung microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The immune cell population in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with&#xD;
           ARDS is dominated by neutrocytes, while T cells are depleted, and show evidence of&#xD;
           hyper-activation and exhaustion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T cell hyper-activation and exhaustion is specifically compartmentalised to the lungs,&#xD;
           and much more pronounced in moderate-to-severe than none-to-mild ARDS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cyto- and chemokines derived from pulmonary immune cells are higher in&#xD;
           moderate-to-severe than none-to-mild ARDS with a greater release from lungs to the&#xD;
           bloodstream, notably of IL-6 and IL-8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The differences in T cell profile in BALF, notably the ratio between regulatory T cells&#xD;
           and T helper 17 cells, will change with disease severity over time, and can be explained&#xD;
           by the presence of tI-IFN antibodies and/or a low microbial diversity of the respiratory&#xD;
           tract with low enrichment from the oral cavity.&#xD;

      Background Pulmonary hyperinflammation with neutrocyte and macrophage invasion and T cell&#xD;
      depletion are common features of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but it&#xD;
      remains to be elucidated whether the T cells in the lungs of patients with ARDS are&#xD;
      hyperactivated and/or exhausted, and to which extent this contributes to neutrocyte invasion&#xD;
      and thus lung tissue destruction. Furthermore, the pulmonary microbiome has shown a reduction&#xD;
      in diversity and interactions in ARDS, which may be important for normal T cell function. At&#xD;
      present, immune cell-microbiome interactions and their relation to disease severity and&#xD;
      progression have not yet been studied in ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall design In 20 mechanically ventilated patients with none-to-mild and 20 with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe non-COVID-19 ARDS according to the Berlin definition an endotracheal&#xD;
      aspirate and BAL fluid (BALF) from separate lung segments will be obtained. Furthermore, an&#xD;
      oral and nasal swab and blood samples will be collected. This will be done within 72 hours&#xD;
      after intubation, and again after 7-10 days if the patient is still intubated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's electronic health record The following is obtained after inclusion: diagnosis codes&#xD;
      and medication (type and dosage, including vasopressors and sedatives), and smoking history&#xD;
      (current/previous/never smoker; pack years); admission time; blood pressure, heart rhythm and&#xD;
      heart rate, temperature, ventilator settings, supportive care (dialysis, ECMO), blood tests&#xD;
      results at admission and on the study days (blood cell counts, coagulation parameters, renal,&#xD;
      liver, and electrolyte panel; arterial and mixed venous blood gases); clinical scores at&#xD;
      admission and on the study days (SAPS3, APACHE II, SOFA), death within 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling Arterial blood samples are drawn from the patient's invasive arterial catheter&#xD;
      (inserted at ICU admission for clinical purposes: for continuous invasive blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring and repeated arterial blood gas collection) immediately before BALF collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchoscopy with BALF collection This procedure is performed in a standardized fashion&#xD;
      according to current clinical guidelines. Immediately prior to the procedure, an oral swab,&#xD;
      nasal swab and an endotracheal aspirate (ETA) are obtained. FIO2 is then increased to 1.0,&#xD;
      and the bronchoscopy procedure is performed using a disposable videoscope with an outer&#xD;
      diameter of 5.0 mm). Three successive 50-ml aliquots of prewarmed (37Â°C) isotonic saline are&#xD;
      instilled in the medial segment of the right middle lobe, aspirated immediately with low&#xD;
      negative suction pressure (&lt; 100 cm H2O), and pooled into a sterile glass container on ice to&#xD;
      obtain a BALF specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards a mini-BAL is performed in the upper and lower lobe of the right lung with a&#xD;
      single installation of 20 ml isotonic saline in each lobe with immediately aspiration into a&#xD;
      sterile container.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements The composition of the immune cell population, as well as the function and&#xD;
      differentiation of various cell lines will be investigated by single-cell RNA sequencing&#xD;
      (scRNA-seq) on selected immune cells from BALF, ETA, and blood, and this will be supplemented&#xD;
      by bulk RNA sequencing with sample barcoding and multiplexing, giving a detailed expression&#xD;
      pattern of all samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The composition microbiome in BALF, ETA, and oral swabs will be assessed by targeted amplicon&#xD;
      sequencing of the hyper-variable regions 1 through 3 of the 16S subunit of ribosomal RNA gene&#xD;
      for bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed using R statistical software version 4.1.1 (R Project&#xD;
      for Statistical Computing) within RStudio statistical software version 1.4.1717 (RStudio),&#xD;
      and p&lt;0.05 considered statistically significant. Inspection of normality and variance&#xD;
      homogeneity will be done by creating qq-plots and histograms. The statistical inference tools&#xD;
      SPIEC-EASI and HeatMaps will be used, and based on correlational analyses, principal&#xD;
      component analyses, including non-hierarchal cluster analysis, will be applied to identify&#xD;
      traits in the two groups.&#xD;
