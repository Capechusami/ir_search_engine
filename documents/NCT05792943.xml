  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irinotecan is commonly used to treat lung, colorectal, pancreatic, stomach, esophageal, and&#xD;
      other types of cancer. The main metabolic pathway of SN-38, the active product of Irinotecan,&#xD;
      is grape glycoalkaloid acidification by UDP - glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) and then&#xD;
      excreted through bile and urine. Clinically, Irinotecan treatment can cause many adverse&#xD;
      reactions, and differences in UGT1A1 genotypes can lead to structural changes or functional&#xD;
      defects in enzymes, causing reduced acidification of grape glycolaldehyde, and increasing&#xD;
      Irinotecan side effects. Therefore, if the patient's ability to metabolize the drug can be&#xD;
      assessed before taking the drug, it will be of great help in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until 2021, cancer will remain the top ten causes of death in Taiwan, of which colorectal and&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer rank third and seventh among the top ten cancers in Taiwan, respectively,&#xD;
      and these two cancers often use complex chemotherapy including irinotecan. Routine detection&#xD;
      of UGT1A1 genotype in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer before irinotecan&#xD;
      treatment predicts the drug metabolism capacity of irinotecan and adjusts the dose, allowing&#xD;
      patients receiving irinotecan to reduce the harm of side effects. At present, the UGT1A1&#xD;
      genotype evaluated is usually only UGT1A1*28, but the common UGT1A1 genotype in Taiwan also&#xD;
      has UGT1A1*6 and UG1A1*63, etc. There is no literature on Taiwanese cancer patients with&#xD;
      actual irinotecan chemotherapy, so this study aims to explore the influence of the UGT1A1&#xD;
      genotype and develop other UGT1A1 genotype test methods. It is expected that molecular&#xD;
      testing tools can improve cancer precision medicine and provide personalized medicine.&#xD;
