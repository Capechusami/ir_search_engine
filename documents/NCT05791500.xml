  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is already known that lifestyle is closely related to human health, disease formation,&#xD;
      learning and work efficiency. Although there have been relevant researches on lifestyle,&#xD;
      there is no research on the current situation of college students' lifestyle and its&#xD;
      correlation with their studies; In addition, how to effectively and scientifically intervene&#xD;
      unhealthy lifestyles and observe the sustainability of the intervention effect has not been&#xD;
      reported. Therefore, this research takes the students in Zhejiang University of Traditional&#xD;
      Chinese Medicine as the research object to carry out a survey, understand the current&#xD;
      situation of their lifestyle, analyze the influence of gender, major, grade and education on&#xD;
      their lifestyle, and explore the correlation between lifestyle and academic performance; And&#xD;
      then the targeted intervention is to be carried out against the unhealthy lifestyle factors&#xD;
      in order to observe the intervention effect and its sustainability&#xD;

      1、Population：Domestic undergraduates, no major diseases, lower grades (freshman, sophomore,&#xD;
      junior, senior), are not receiving any special treatment or in a state of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2、intervention：&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dietary habits intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
           (1)．Canteen intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Select some shops from the dining hall of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, and&#xD;
                randomly set them into the control group and the intervention group by drawing&#xD;
                lots. Before the intervention, take photos of all kinds of food in the shop and&#xD;
                collect their monthly sales data, calculate their caloric value according to the&#xD;
                Chinese food composition database, score each dish through DQI-I(Dietary Quality&#xD;
                Index-International), and make food labels.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Put up food labels on the menu of the intervention group's door shop, and do not&#xD;
                paste food labels on the control group's door shop. A one month intervention&#xD;
                experiment will be carried out after ensuring that there won't be any other&#xD;
                activities like discount or any changes to the dishes sold in the shop during the&#xD;
                experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. After the intervention, the sales data of various kinds of food products in the&#xD;
                shops of the control group and the intervention group in November were counted&#xD;
                again.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (2)． Crowd intervention 4、80 volunteers (α =0.05、1- β =0.9, SD(standard deviation)=&#xD;
           6.79, δ =5),are recruited in Zhejiang Chinese Medical University by posting posters in&#xD;
           the dining hall and in the form of posters spread by QQ or WeChat(two popular social&#xD;
           media platforms) , and divide them into the control group and the intervention group by&#xD;
           randomly drawing lots, Before the intervention, the baseline dietary health data of&#xD;
           volunteers are collected by food pictures taken within three days and filling in the&#xD;
           KABP(Knowledge,Attitude,Belief,Practice) questionnaire for college students' health&#xD;
           literacy: food pictures are scored according to the International Dietary Quality Index&#xD;
           (DQI-I), and then the dietary health literacy data of college students (including&#xD;
           dietary health level, dietary health knowledge and dietary health attitude) is obtained&#xD;
           through the Knowledge-Attitude,Belief-Practice(KABP) model based questionnaire for&#xD;
           dietary health.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5、lay down dietary health education measures based on KABP model, which emphasizes on&#xD;
           improving people's belief in diet health (In the course, students can be taught the&#xD;
           dangers of unhealthy diet through some videos, and it is not difficult to form a healthy&#xD;
           diet, and students can realize the benefits of healthy diet, so that students can&#xD;
           understand the importance of healthy diet, which will improve their attitude and brief&#xD;
           towards dietary health.), The course topics may include reasonable diet to lose weight,&#xD;
           how to carry out the nutrition matching of three meals, and the classification of&#xD;
           unhealthy food. And the courses are scheduled on every Wednesday afternoon for four&#xD;
           times.&#xD;
&#xD;
           6、After the four courses, the students were asked to upload the pictures of the food&#xD;
           they had eaten for three days again, fill in the KAP(Knowledge,Attitude,Practice)&#xD;
           questionnaire on dietary health again, and we will calculate the total score and analyse&#xD;
           the differences&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exercise habit intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1．Intervention object： A total of 90 healthy student volunteers (mainly sophomores and&#xD;
           juniors) are recruited from Zhejiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.There&#xD;
           are 30 people in the blank control group and 60 people in the intervention group (30&#xD;
           people in the running group and 30 people in the jumping rope group).Numbers will be&#xD;
           adjusted depending on recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2. Theory teaching The PE teacher is invited to give a theoretical teaching before the&#xD;
           sports training intervention to explain the benefits, functions and methods of physical&#xD;
           exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Athletic training The volunteers are randomly assigned to three groups (blank control&#xD;
           group, running group and rope skipping group). The two groups of intervention students&#xD;
           are given running exercise and rope skipping exercise training at least 4 times a week,&#xD;
           each time at least 50 minutes for boys and at least 40 minutes for girls, for a&#xD;
           consecutive semester. Before the experiment, students in the two intervention groups&#xD;
           learn the basic movements and complete sets of movements of the two exercise&#xD;
           prescriptions , so as to ensure the training quality in the experiment period and reduce&#xD;
           injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Remarks: The training intensity of the exercise intervention will be strengthened&#xD;
           according to the actual situation in the middle and later period of the intervention;&#xD;
           Exercise interventions are expected to use applications and other forms of objective&#xD;
           data collection and monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4．index testing： Students are tested uniformly before the intervention, Selection of&#xD;
           college students' body mass index (BMI,kg/m^2), the main life/physiological indexes&#xD;
           (blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, etc.) in succession, crook proneness, standing&#xD;
           long jump, pull-ups (male)/sit-ups (female) and 1000 - meter run (male) / 800 - meter&#xD;
           run (female), 50 meters, body fat index to assess students' flexibility quality, power&#xD;
           quality, endurance quality. At the end of the experiment, students are tested again.&#xD;
           Finally, the scores of each physical test are analyzed and compared between the&#xD;
           intervention group and the blank control group, and the scores of the last physical test&#xD;
           before and after the intervention are analyzed and compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Life Schedule And Habits Intervention Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Recruit experimental volunteers（The specific method is to send advertisements&#xD;
                online,place recruitment roll-ups at the entrance of the canteen, and release&#xD;
                promotional posters in the WeChat and grade groups），and randomly divide them into&#xD;
                three groups: Life Schedule Intervention Group, Lifestyle Intervention Group and&#xD;
                Control Group.Before the intervention experiment, all volunteers are required to&#xD;
                fill out a questionnaire to collect the current status and relationship between the&#xD;
                lifestyle and academic performance of the volunteers before the intervention&#xD;
                experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Life Schedule and habits Intervention Group requires the volunteers to have a daily&#xD;
                work and rest time of 7-8 hours, adjusted according to their original work and&#xD;
                rest, but no later than 9:00 to get up and 23:00 to fall asleep; Volunteers are&#xD;
                asked to record daily schedule and approximate time of falling asleep and getting&#xD;
                up. Upload the screenshots of their mobile phones and schedules every week. In the&#xD;
                same time, volunteers are required to change their intimate clothes every day and&#xD;
                clean themselves at least twice a day（mainly including brushing their teeth and&#xD;
                washing their faces at least twice in the morning and evening, and showering&#xD;
                once）The bed is guaranteed to sun/wash the quilt once a month, the sheets are&#xD;
                changed twice a week in spring and autumn, and once a month in winter. The desk in&#xD;
                the dorm is arranged neatly and orderly, the study and daily necessities are sorted&#xD;
                and placed, at least there is place for office and study, the bed is clean and&#xD;
                tidy, no garbage, no dirt. It is required to upload the hygiene situation of the&#xD;
                bedroom (including the desk and the bed) once a week, and take a photo every time&#xD;
                the bedding is changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Before and during the intervention, the researchers shared relevant popular science&#xD;
                videos, public accounts, articles, etc. on factors such as lifestyle and life&#xD;
                schedule to the Life Schedule Intervention Group, Lifestyle Intervention Group. The&#xD;
                intervention lasts one semester. The control group did not do the above&#xD;
                intervention treatment, but still carried out relevant data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of the intervention experiment, all volunteers (including the intervention&#xD;
      group and the control group) filled in the questionnaire to collect the current situation and&#xD;
      relationship between the volunteers' lifestyle and academic performance before the&#xD;
      intervention experiment. Two months after the end of the intervention, the current lifestyle&#xD;
      status of all volunteers is re-collected, and the effect of the intervention is assessed on&#xD;
      the current status and relationship between the intervention and lifestyle, academic&#xD;
      performance, and each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3、Comparison：No interventions above, only the questionnaire is required to collect basic&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4、Outcome：The level of health status of college students (diet, exercise, psychology, work&#xD;
      and rest, bad habits), academic level 5、Study design：randomised controlled trials&#xD;
