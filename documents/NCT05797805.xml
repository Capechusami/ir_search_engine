  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who&#xD;
      have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tegavivint will be administered as a single-agent first in a dose escalation, optimization,&#xD;
      and subsequent expansion cohort at the recommended phase 2 dose. Single agent dose escalation&#xD;
      will follow a standard 3+3 design to determine the tegavivint maximum tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
      Upon completion of the dose escalation section, the dose selection optimization will expand&#xD;
      two selected dose levels before declaring the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for use in the&#xD;
      monotherapy dose expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If sufficient clinical benefit is observed, the combination of tegavivint with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      in patients with mutations in either CTNNB1 or AXIN1 genes and previously treated with a&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor will be explored in the second part of the study. This study will begin&#xD;
      with a brief dose escalation part. The starting dose will be based on the RP2D determined&#xD;
      from the monotherapy dose escalation and optimization. The dose escalation will follow a&#xD;
      standard 3+3 design and the dose escalation increments for tegavivint will follow the&#xD;
      monotherapy dose escalation schedule to determine the combination MTD. Upon completion of the&#xD;
      combination dose escalation, a randomized (1:1) dose selection optimization will be used to&#xD;
      determine the combination RP2D.&#xD;

                  measurement is not possible due to factors such as a pacemaker or bundle branch&#xD;
                  block, the patient may be evaluated by a cardiologist who must document no&#xD;
                  apparent increased risk for Torsades de Point or other morbidity associated with&#xD;

             any significantly invasive procedure into a major body cavity (abdomen, cranium etc.)&#xD;
             and/or surgery requiring extensive recuperation (joint replacement). Please discuss&#xD;
             with the Medical Monitor if there are any questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study. The effects of&#xD;
             tegavivint on the developing human fetus have the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. There is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with tegavivint&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men who are sexually active with WOCBP&#xD;
             must agree to use one highly effective method of contraception, including hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives (e.g. combined oral contraceptives, patch, vaginal ring, injectables,&#xD;
             and implants); intrauterine device or intrauterine system; vasectomy or tubal&#xD;
             ligation; and one effective method of contraception, including male condom, female&#xD;
             condom, cervical cap, diaphragm or contraceptive sponge or abstaining from sex for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation and for at least 4 months following completion of&#xD;
             tegavivint and pembrolizumab (if applicable) administration. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for PK interactions with tegavivint.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusions for patients treated on study with pembrolizumab:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have received a live vaccine or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to&#xD;
                  the first dose of study drug. Administration of killed vaccines is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or are receiving chronic systemic steroid&#xD;
                  therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other&#xD;
                  form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
                  drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2&#xD;
                  years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or&#xD;
                  immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or&#xD;
                  physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary&#xD;
                  insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is&#xD;
                  allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that&#xD;
                  required steroids or have current pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior allogeneic organ or bone marrow transplant&#xD;
