  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with a decline in cardiovascular health, cognitive function and losses in&#xD;
      muscle strength, with half or more of those over age 65 suffering from two or more&#xD;
      comorbidities (e.g., heart disease, type 2 diabetes). The worldwide population of older&#xD;
      adults is growing rapidly, with one in six people expected to be over age 65 by 2050. This&#xD;
      will place further financial burden from chronic diseases on already stressed healthcare&#xD;
      systems. While studies show that frequent exercise is an effective way for older adults to&#xD;
      maintain or improve cardiovascular and metabolic health, older individuals are less&#xD;
      physically active and do not adhere well to exercise programs, often due to physical or&#xD;
      medical limitations. Therefore, alternative methods for older adults to get the same health&#xD;
      benefits as exercise require further exploration. Recent work has shown that passive heat&#xD;
      therapy may be one such alternative solution.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with declines in cardiovascular health and cognitive function as well as&#xD;
      chronic inflammation and the development of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's&#xD;
      and Parkinson's disease. Additionally, ageing results in a loss of muscle size and strength,&#xD;
      commonly referred to as sarcopenia, leading to increased risk of falls or adverse&#xD;
      exercise-related events. It is well understood that frequent exercise improves cardiovascular&#xD;
      and metabolic health whilst lowering the risk of disease and all-cause mortality, acting as a&#xD;
      treatment for many different health conditions. Despite the evidence of its efficacy, many&#xD;
      individuals struggle with adherence to exercise programmes, particularly older adults and&#xD;
      clinical populations, with many individuals within these populations unable to perform&#xD;
      exercise due to physical limitations or medical contraindications. With one in six people&#xD;
      expected to be over the age of 65 years by 2050 and corresponding increases in&#xD;
      non-communicable diseases (e.g., cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) anticipated from&#xD;
      this aging population, the development of adjunct treatments or alternatives to exercise to&#xD;
      improve general health in older populations is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent work has shown that a potential solution could be the use of passive heat therapy&#xD;
      (PHT) (e.g., hot water immersion, sauna), which can achieve health benefits comparable to&#xD;
      exercise. Previous work by Brunt and colleagues using eight weeks of chronic heat therapy has&#xD;
      demonstrated systemic macro- and microvascular adaptations in young, healthy individuals&#xD;
      including improved endothelial function, reduced arterial stiffness and cutaneous vascular&#xD;
      conductance. Chronic passive heat acclimation in young, healthy adults has also been shown to&#xD;
      improve working memory. Additional studies have shown that ten weeks of passive heating&#xD;
      improved muscle strength in middle-aged men and ten days of daily pulsed shortwave diathermy&#xD;
      attenuated immobilization-induced muscle atrophy in young, healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One potential mechanism for the physiological benefits obtained from PHT is the increase of&#xD;
      cytoprotective heat shock proteins (HSP) (specifically HSP27, HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90)&#xD;
      intracellularly (i) and extracellularly (e) in response to increases in deep body&#xD;
      temperature. Increases in the expression of these HSPs have been shown to play a role in&#xD;
      reducing inflammation and protecting the vasculature via increases in endothelial nitric&#xD;
      oxide synthase activity. Increased HSP concentrations may also prevent the accumulation of&#xD;
      harmful biomarkers in the brain that play a role in cognitive decline and development of&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases. Aging, however, is associated with a reduction in HSP&#xD;
      transcription activity in various tissues, resulting in an impaired heat shock response and&#xD;
      development of a pro-inflammatory state. Previous work using acute hot water immersion has&#xD;
      shown increases in eHSP70. The only study to test the effects of chronic hot water immersion&#xD;
      on resting iHSP70 showed no effect, however, the magnitude of stimulus (39°C water) applied&#xD;
      by Hoekstra and colleagues and the resultant changes in core temperature were likely too low&#xD;
      to induce any changes in HSPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies provide promising evidence that health benefits from PHT similar to those from&#xD;
      exercise could translate to older adults. However, most studies testing the effects of PHT on&#xD;
      humans have been performed in young, healthy adults, whereas older individuals are likely to&#xD;
      derive the greatest benefit from any positive effects of PHT. To date, no study has examined&#xD;
      the longer-term effects of PHT on macrovascular, microvascular, cognitive or muscle function,&#xD;
      or HSPs in older adults. Therefore, further research is needed to confirm that heat therapy&#xD;
      confers the same beneficial health adaptations in older adults.&#xD;
