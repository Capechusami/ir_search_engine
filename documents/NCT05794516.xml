             Male participants must also agree not to donate sperm from the signing of the informed&#xD;
             consent to 6 months after the last scheduled dose of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to understand the characteristics and purposes of the study,&#xD;
             including possible risks involved, and willing to comply with all the study&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Use of prescription medications, biological products, or other medicines within 2&#xD;
             weeks before Study Day 1 or 5 half-lives of the product, whichever is greater. Use of&#xD;

             unless considered by the Investigator to not pose a risk or impact the study results.&#xD;

          -  Positive for HIV, active hepatitis C or B, Covid-19 virus, tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bacteria, viruses, systemic fungi, parasites, or other opportunistic infections within&#xD;
             30 days before Study Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;

             urine drug Screening (Day -28 to Day -1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donated blood (including component blood) or lost &gt; 400 mL within 3 months before&#xD;
             Screening or received a transfusion within 3 months of Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of relevant allergies (including allergy to any murine or human-derived&#xD;
             protein or immunoglobulin products, rubber or latex, or other allergies that in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator make inclusion in the study inappropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Average daily smoking &gt; 10 cigarettes/day (or equivalent) within 6 months of&#xD;
             Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consume &gt; 14 standard units of alcohol per week (1 standard unit is equivalent to&#xD;
             approximately 360 mL of beer, 45 mL of spirits with 40% alcohol, or 150 mL of wine) or&#xD;
             a positive alcohol breath test on Day -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any disease that might interfere with the safety evaluation of the investigational&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
