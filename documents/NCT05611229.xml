  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an observational study utilizing electronic health record (EHR)-derived data&#xD;
      collected retrospectively during routine care of real-world patients with advanced melanoma&#xD;
      from NOBLE (Novartis Braf+ meLanoma patients ObsErvational) dataset.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NOBLE database was built from the harmonization of two customized oncology specific EHR&#xD;
      databases: Flatiron Health Spotlight and Concerto Custom Patient360. BRAF v600 mutated&#xD;
      advanced (i.e., stage III or IV) patients treated at oncology practices across the US were&#xD;
      identified in these two databases for potential inclusion. Both the Flatiron Health&#xD;
      EHR-derived database and the Concerto Patient360 database contain clinical, demographic,&#xD;
      treatment, and mortality information for melanoma patients from the time of initial diagnosis&#xD;
      until death or the most recent data cut-off, which is August 31, 2020 (for population 1), and&#xD;
      May 31, 2020 (for population 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For population 1 (patients treated in the adjuvant setting): included patients were aged more&#xD;
      than or equal to 18 years, were required to have a diagnosis of melanoma (ICD-9 172.x &amp;&#xD;
      ICD-10 C43.x or D03.x), pathologic stage III disease, evidence of resection, adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment with Immunotherapy (IO) (e.g., Nivolumab (nivo) or Pembrolizumab (pembro)) or&#xD;
      Targeted Therapy (TT) (e.g., Dabrafenib+ Trametinib (dab+tram)) on or after January 1, 2014&#xD;
      and prior to August 30,2020 (data cut-off), and any evidence of a BRAF+ result. Patients were&#xD;
      required to have at least 6 months of follow-up after initiation of adjuvant treatment.&#xD;
      Patients were followed until the earlier of death, data cut-off, loss of follow-up, or&#xD;
      received MM diagnosis. While the first systemic therapy approved for use in the adjuvant&#xD;
      melanoma setting occurred in 2015, the study period of interest begins on January 1, 2014, to&#xD;
      include any potential off-label use of these therapies as adjuvant therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For population 2 (patients with Low tumor burden (LTB) treated in the metastatic setting):&#xD;
      included patients were aged more than or equal to 18 years, and were required to have a&#xD;
      diagnosis of melanoma (ICD-9 172.x &amp; ICD-10 C43 or D03x), a pathologic stage IV diagnosis,&#xD;
      treatment with IO (e.g. Ipilimumab (ipi), nivo, pembro, ipi+nivo) or TT (dab+tram,&#xD;
      Vemurafenib+Cobimetinib, Encorafenib+Binimetinib (vem+cobi, enco+bini) on or after January 1,&#xD;
      2014 and prior to May 31, 2020 (data cut-off), and evidence of a BRAF+ result after therapy&#xD;
      initiation. Patients were required to be classified as LTB at the time of stage IV diagnosis.&#xD;
      LTB was defined as having normal LDH and &lt;3 metastatic sites at the time of stage IV&#xD;
      diagnosis. To align with recent FDA approvals for combination therapies use in the MM&#xD;
      setting, the study period of interest began on January 1, 2014. Furthermore, this sampling&#xD;
      interval allowed for a maximum of 6 years of follow-up from the start of study period.&#xD;
