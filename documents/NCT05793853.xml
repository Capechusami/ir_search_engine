    <textblock>
      This is a prospective three year natural history study of adults with hypoparathyroidism. The&#xD;
      goal is to monitor patients with hypoparathyroidism to define end-organ damage in the context&#xD;
      of the disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to prospectively collect data on the natural history of&#xD;
      hypoparathyroidism (HPT). This will enable longitudinal data collection of complications in&#xD;
      this disease, specifically defining the epidemiology of end-organ complications of HPT that&#xD;
      are related to high calcification propensity. It will also determine relationships between&#xD;
      calcification burden and end-organ disease severity and progression risk and assess the&#xD;
      utility of traditional and novel biomarkers of mineral and bone metabolism on disease&#xD;
      diagnosis and monitoring. These data will inform future investigations on the development,&#xD;
      study, and implementation of HPT end-organ disease modifying strategies and impact clinical&#xD;
      practice in hypoparathyroidism.The study objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Build a prospective cohort of patients to study HPT-associated end-organ damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine end-organ physiologic consequences of HPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Elucidate determinants of HPT-associated end-organ damage.&#xD;
