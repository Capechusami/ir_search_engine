    <textblock>
      Dental caries is a preventable major public health disease affecting people of all ages and&#xD;
      substantially impacting overall health. Caries remain the single most common chronic&#xD;
      childhood disease. Dental caries is a dynamic and complex process. Several variables&#xD;
      influence the occurrence of dental caries, including oral flora, saliva flow and composition,&#xD;
      and lifestyle. Dental caries development can be primary (new carious lesion) or secondary&#xD;
      (lesion progression or reactivated carious lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been much progress over the past several decades in the prevention of dental&#xD;
      caries, shifting from the management of dental caries from a &quot;surgical approach&quot; to a&#xD;
      &quot;medical prevention strategy&quot;, based on a better understanding of the caries disease process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caries Risk Assessment (CRA) is a significant part of successfully applying the minimum&#xD;
      intervention dentistry philosophy in managing dental caries. As recommended by AAPD, Dental&#xD;
      caries-risk assessment should be a routine component of new and periodic examinations by oral&#xD;
      health and medical providers. Therefore, this study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude,&#xD;
      and practice of a group of dental practitioners from Cairo and Riyadh regarding caries risk&#xD;
      assessment and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to Practitioner:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increasing awareness of the importance of CRA practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implementing a positive attitude regarding CRA and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve practices toward CRA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to Patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increasing the awareness and knowledge of early caries prevention by dentists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increasing awareness about Caries Risk Assessment and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to Community:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Increasing the knowledge and awareness of the community regarding preventive dentistry and&#xD;
      the importance of primary prevention&#xD;
