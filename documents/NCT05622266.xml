  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the effectiveness of pulpotomy in mature permanent tooth with&#xD;
      irreversible pulpits, and compare the clinical efficacy of pulpotomy and root canal therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, root canal therapy ( RCT ) is still the main treatment for mature teeth diagnosed&#xD;
      as irreversible pulpitis, but the teeth after RCT become non-vital, losing the immune defense&#xD;
      mechanism and regeneration potential of pulp, which is not conducive to the long-term&#xD;
      preservation of teeth. The traditional view is that mature permanent teeth with irreversible&#xD;
      pulpitis are not indications for pulpotomy. However, with the deepening of pulp biology&#xD;
      research and the availability of new pulp capping materials, the effect of pulpotomy is more&#xD;
      predictable. Recent studies have shown that pulpotomy for irreversible pulpitis teeth can&#xD;
      achieve good results, however, there is a lack of high-quality randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      studies, and the effect of pulpotomy compared with RCT studies rarely reported. Therefore,&#xD;
      this project intends to explore the curative effect of pulpotomy on mature permanent teeth&#xD;
      with irreversible pulpitis, and analyze the influence of age, tooth position and other&#xD;
      factors on its curative effect, broaden the indications of pulpotomy, and establish the&#xD;
      indications and standardized operation process of pulpotomy for mature permanent teeth with&#xD;
      irreversible pulpitis.&#xD;
