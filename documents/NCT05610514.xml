  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of e-cigarettes and continued smoking on&#xD;
      pulmonary and cardiac outcomes in a population with established pulmonary disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      E-cigarettes with nicotine can affect important cardiopulmonary outcomes and likely pose less&#xD;
      risk than cigarettes, but they are not harmless. Given the existing literature, there is a&#xD;
      need for controlled trials of e-cigarette use in populations with cardiopulmonary disease to&#xD;
      fill the gaps between these existing examinations. Clarifying how the pulmonary and cardiac&#xD;
      effects of e-cigarettes compare to use of conventional cigarettes in those with&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary disease beyond single acute exposures will provide important new health&#xD;
      information that can help inform policy.&#xD;
