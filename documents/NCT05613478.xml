  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer. Hepatectomy is a&#xD;
      curable and effective method. However, the recurrence rate is as high as 50%~70% in 5 years&#xD;
      after surgery. Perioperative treatment with immunotherapy combined with target therapy is&#xD;
      expected to improve the patient's prognosis. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of camrelizumab combined with apatinib mesylate in the perioperative period&#xD;
      of resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival (RFS) of camrelizumab combined with apatinib mesylate in the&#xD;
      perioperative period of hepatocellular carcinoma (CNLC Ib-IIIa). The secondary research&#xD;
      purpose is to evaluate the R0 resection rate, the rate of subjects with major pathological&#xD;
      response, the rate of subjects with pathological complete response, event-free survival&#xD;
      (EFS), overall survival and 12-months recurrence-free survival of camrelizumab combined with&#xD;
      apatinib mesylate in the perioperative period of resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The&#xD;
      safety and tolerability is also evaluated.&#xD;

      of resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. This trial includes subjects with CNLC&#xD;
      Ib/IIa/IIb/IIIa HCC. All eligible subjects will be randomized (1:1) to experimental group or&#xD;
      control group. In the experimental group, patients will be treated with following:&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy ( perioperative TACE treatment，camrelizumab and apatinib, 2 cycles),&#xD;
      radical surgery, postoperative TACE treatment, adjuvant therapy (camrelizumab and apatinib, 6&#xD;
      cycles); in the control group, patients will be treated with following: radical surgery,&#xD;
      postoperative TACE treatment. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival (RFS) of camrelizumab combined with apatinib mesylate in the&#xD;
