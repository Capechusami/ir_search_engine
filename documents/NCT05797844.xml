      This study aimed to evaluate how an educational intervention based on the existing&#xD;
      evidence-based guidelines, using both active and passive educational implementetion&#xD;
      strategies, could improve the knowledge of nurses regarding managing ETT cuff pressure&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis H1: There is a difference between the training given with the active and passive&#xD;
      implementation strategies method in improving the endotracheal cuff pressure control&#xD;
      knowledge of intensive care nurses.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study was carried out as a quasi-experimental two-group pretest-posttest research design&#xD;
      to evaluate the effect of endotracheal tube cuff pressure control training given with the&#xD;
      active and passive implementation strategies methods on the knowledge level of nurses. The&#xD;
      research was carried out in the intensive care units of a Training and Research Hospital,&#xD;
      between June and December 2022, in 6 intensive care units (General ICU 1-General ICU 2-&#xD;
      General ICU 3, CVC ICU, 2nd Level ICU, Coronary ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intensive care unit of the hospital where the study was conducted, the endotracheal&#xD;
      tube cuff pressure is controlled by the pilot balloon finger palpation method in four hours.&#xD;
      In addition, pressure measurement was not made with the cuff manometer. However, in&#xD;
      endotracheal tube cuff control, cuff pressure should be monitored to prevent aspiration and&#xD;
      the cuff pressure should be kept between 20-30 cmH2O. Before the data of the study started to&#xD;
      be collected, a cuff manometer was purchased by the hospital management to be used in the&#xD;
      intensive care units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The universe of the research consisted of 120 nurses working in the intensive care units&#xD;
      where the study was conducted. The necessary sample of the study was determined by using&#xD;
      G*Power computer software program version 3.0.1 as recommended to be used in calculating the&#xD;
      desired sample by previous studies. The sample consisted of 90 nurses scheduled for, with a&#xD;
      power value to represent 95% of the study population at a 80% confidence interval, 0.05 error&#xD;
      level, and 0.6 effect size according to power analysis. Research Randomizer software&#xD;
      (http://www.randomizer.org.) was used to generate a randomized list by applying a simple&#xD;
      randomization technique to each participant's allocation. The 90 participants were divided&#xD;
      into two even groups (Intervention Group =45, Control Group =43 nurses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographic and occupational characteristics form and knowledge level evaluation form&#xD;
      regarding endotracheal tube cuff pressure control were used to collect the data of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the nurses working in the intensive care unit work in day and night shifts, the&#xD;
      sociodemographic and occupational characteristics form to be applied before the training and&#xD;
      the knowledge level evaluation form on endotracheal tube cuff pressure control (pretest) were&#xD;
      collected by the researchers after the nurses' shift delivery hours. After applying the&#xD;
      pre-test questionnaires (experimental /Control group), on the days determined together with&#xD;
      the intensive care unit nurses in charge and the nursing services directorate, all nurses&#xD;
      were given theoretical training on endotracheal tube cuff pressure management through a&#xD;
      4-hour presentation prepared with evidence-based guide and literature. Thus, all nurses&#xD;
      gained equal knowledge. A PowerPoint presentation including endotracheal tube cuff pressure&#xD;
      normal values, complications related to endotracheal tube cuff pressure, management of&#xD;
      endotracheal tube cuff pressure, endotracheal tube cuff pressure control methods, methods&#xD;
      affecting endotracheal tube cuff pressure, how to measure endotracheal tube cuff pressure was&#xD;
      made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses included in experimental group were trained through a 4-hour presentation (passive&#xD;
      implementation strategy) prepared in the presence of evidence-based guidelines and&#xD;
      literature, in addition, they were given a brochure about cuff pressure measurement and a&#xD;
      brochure about cuff pressure was hung in the intensive care units where there are handwashing&#xD;
      sinks. In addition, 4 follow-up visits (active implementation strategy) were carried out for&#xD;
      ETT cuff pressure management using the one-on-one demonstration technique every 21 days.&#xD;
      These follow-ups included adherence to evidence-based guidelines, nurses' application of&#xD;
      endotracheal cuff pressure measurement and solving the problems encountered during its&#xD;
      implementation. Uncertainties associated with evidence-based guidance on endotracheal tube&#xD;
      cuff pressure control were clarified during these sessions. Nurses included in control group&#xD;
      were trained through a 4-hour presentation (passive implamentation strategy) prepared in the&#xD;
      presence of evidence-based guidelines and literature, in addition, they were given a brochure&#xD;
      about cuff pressure measurement and a brochure about cuff pressure was hung in the intensive&#xD;
      care units where there are handwashing sinks. No follow-up visits were made to this group. 3&#xD;
      months after the training, the Knowledge Level Evaluation Form (post-test) on Endotracheal&#xD;
      Tube Cuff Pressure Control was re-applied to all nurses working in intensive care units and&#xD;
      participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study were analyzed in the IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0 (Statistical Package&#xD;
      for Social Sciences IBM Corp., Armonk, NYC, USA) package program. Number, percentages, means,&#xD;
      standard deviations, were used for descriptive statistics of demographic and occupational&#xD;
      characteristics of the nurses. Correct answers to the questions on the knowledge level form&#xD;
      were given one point each while incorrect ones were given zero points. The knowledge level&#xD;
      scores were calculated by averaging the number of correct answers. The Shapiro-Wilk test was&#xD;
      used for normality. The t-test was used to evaluate the education level between the&#xD;
      intervention groups before and after the training. The Paired Sample t Test was used to&#xD;
      compare the pre-training and post-training average scores for each groups. In all results,&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
