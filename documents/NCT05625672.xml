      The aim of the present study is to determine the effectiveness of hemovigilance module&#xD;
      training given to nurses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      125 nurses from the clinic and intensive care units, who received the most intensive blood&#xD;
      transfusion from two different hospitals, were included in the study as the intervention and&#xD;
      control groups. The control group was not trained. Only the pretest was administered one week&#xD;
      after the posttest. After the pre-test was applied to the nurses in the intervention group,&#xD;
      five modules of training, which lasted four hours, were given using interactive methods. Five&#xD;
      modules of training were prepared by the researcher. These five modules are the 1st module of&#xD;
      training; definition of hemovigilance, its aims, the development of hemovigilance in the&#xD;
      world and in Turkey, and legal legislation, Module 2; Donor selection, Blood donation&#xD;
      Process, Phlebotomy and Donor reactions, Module 3; blood, blood transfusion, its purpose,&#xD;
      properties of blood and blood components, Blood transfusion process, Module 4; acute and&#xD;
      delayed transfusion reactions and management, Module 5; It consists of the national&#xD;
      hemovigilance system, the organization of the hemovigilance system at the hospital level,&#xD;
      Traceability, Trace-back from the Patient to the Donor, and Look-back from the Donor to the&#xD;
      Patient. the training was over, the final test was administered. One month later, this test&#xD;
      was repeated.&#xD;
