    <textblock>
      The technological advance of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has once&#xD;
      again brought lesion therapy back to the clinical frontline for the treatment of movement&#xD;
      disorder. Thus far, the safety of MRgFUS has been widely proven and has just been made&#xD;
      available in China in late 2020. We attempted to analyze the neuroplasticity characteristics&#xD;
      and altered neural circuit activity in patients subjected with MRgFUS thalamotomy via&#xD;
      Multiple MR Imaging study, and to explore potential biomarkers that could be used to predict&#xD;
      the treatment outcome.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson disease (PD) are the most prevalent tremor disorders. ET,&#xD;
      considered as a pure tremor disease, is characterized by upper limb intention or postural&#xD;
      tremor, while PD is characterized by a variety of motor and nonmotor symptoms, among them&#xD;
      rest tremor. Tremor suppression can be achieved by lesioning or stimulating a relay nucleus&#xD;
      of the thalamus, known as the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM). One emerging and promising&#xD;
      approach to lesion VIM is magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS). This&#xD;
      technique allows delivery of spherical phased converging beams to a specific brain target&#xD;
      using MR imaging (MRI) for guidance. A number of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety of ExAblate MRgFUS thalamotomy for medication-refractory tremor in patients with&#xD;
      ET/PD. MRgFUS thalamotomy has been approved for ET/PD patients in late 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a technique for measuring structural features and mapping&#xD;
      brain activity that is noninvasive and safe. It is being used in many studies to better&#xD;
      understand how the healthy brain works, and in a growing number of studies it is being&#xD;
      applied to understand how that normal function is disrupted in disease. The analysis of the&#xD;
      imaging data related to MRgFUS thalamotomy may help us to further understand the&#xD;
      neuroplasticity characteristics of patients around treatment and the altered brain network&#xD;
      dynamics. It would also further help us grasp the advantages and disadvantages of such brain&#xD;
      lesion therapy techniques and serves guidance for the next clinical studies. Therefore, we&#xD;
      registered this new study for our current prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brief summary of retrospective data：&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Medication-refractory ET and PD Patients subjected with MRgFUS thalamotomy were recruited&#xD;
      for multimodal MR scanning, including T2; T2 Flair; DWI; ESWAN; MRS; 3D ASL 2.0s; 3D-T1; DTI;&#xD;
      rs-functional MRI at baseline, postoperative 1-day, postoperative 1-week, postoperative&#xD;
      1-month, postoperative 3-months, postoperative 6-months, postoperative 1-year, postoperative&#xD;
      2-year, postoperative 3-year, postoperative 4-year, postoperative 5-year. Extra baseline info&#xD;
      were also collected, as well as ultrasound parameters (energy, power, duration time,&#xD;
      temperature, target location), clinical assessment (clinical rating scale for tremor (CRST),&#xD;
      Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), associated adverse effects and so on.&#xD;
