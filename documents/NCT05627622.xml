  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney and ureteral stones are a common problem in primary care practice with increasing&#xD;
      prevalence over the last few decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention of recurrent stones (which are usually composed primarily of calcium oxalate) is&#xD;
      aimed at decreasing the concentrations of the lithogenic factors. There are several metabolic&#xD;
      and dietary treatable components. In all patients with urolithiasis, adequate fluid intake&#xD;
      and lower body mass index are key components to reducing the risk of recurrent stones. For&#xD;
      most patients, additional beneficial dietary modifications are increasing intake of fruits&#xD;
      and vegetables which are rich in potassium, and reducing intake of candies and sweetened&#xD;
      juices which are rich in sucrose and fructose. In addition, for patients who have been&#xD;
      prescribed medications, adherence to medication may become an important issue over the long&#xD;
      term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile technology has the potential to optimize health care and patient's adherence,&#xD;
      especially through personal education and dissemination of health information. One of the&#xD;
      most common technologies available on mobile is the WhatsApp Messenger® application. WhatsApp&#xD;
      is a freeware messaging service; it allows streamlining patient-provider communication via&#xD;
      text and voice messages, video clips and images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypotheses are, first, that use of WhatsApp to disseminate information regarding&#xD;
      stones preventive measures will have a substantial positive effect on follow-up compliance&#xD;
      and on patient's adherence to the preventive measures. Second, we expect reduction in&#xD;
      cumulative stone recurrence rate.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Kidney and ureteral stones are a common problem in primary care practice with increasing&#xD;
      prevalence over the last few decades. Nineteen percent of men and nine percent of women will&#xD;
      be diagnosed with a kidney stone by the age of 70 years,and the rates of emergency department&#xD;
      visit for urolithiasis were increased from 178 to 340 visits per 100,000 individuals from&#xD;
      1992 to 2009 (United States).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention of recurrent stones, which are usually composed primarily of calcium oxalate, is&#xD;
      aimed at decreasing the concentrations of the lithogenic factors. There are several metabolic&#xD;
      and dietary treatable components. In all patients with urolithiasis, adequate fluid intake&#xD;
      and lower body mass index are key components to reducing the risk of recurrent stones. For&#xD;
      most patients, additional beneficial dietary modifications are increasing intake of fruits&#xD;
      and vegetables which are rich in potassium, and reducing intake of candies and sweetened&#xD;
      juices which are rich in sucrose and fructose. In addition, for patients who have been&#xD;
      prescribed medications, adherence to medication may become an important issue over the long&#xD;
      term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As early as the 1980s, &quot;The stone clinic effect&quot; on the recurrence rate of stone disease was&#xD;
      published. Hosking et al. demonstrated that a regimen of increased fluid intake and&#xD;
      appropriate dietary modifications, to avoid dietary excesses, reduces stone growth and new&#xD;
      stone formation in patients with idiopathic calcium urolithiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the 2019 European Association of Urology guidelines on urolithiasis, all stone&#xD;
      formers, independent of their individual risk, should follow preventive measures such as&#xD;
      circadian fluid drinking of 2.5-3 liter daily, limitation of NaCl content to 5 gram daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trials documenting benefit from these preventive measures required at least three years&#xD;
      before the results were significant. However, in an analysis of over 3000 patients followed&#xD;
      in a well-organized stone clinic at the University of Chicago, between 20% and 30% of&#xD;
      patients were lost to follow-up every year. Only 15 to 40 percent of patients complied with&#xD;
      the follow-up requirements by three years. Adherence to long-term therapy among those who did&#xD;
      not follow-up was presumably very low. Hence, improving patient's adherence and follow-up&#xD;
      compliance is of paramount importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile technology has the potential to optimize health care and patient's adherence,&#xD;
      especially through personal education and dissemination of health information. One of the&#xD;
      most common technologies available on mobile is the WhatsApp Messenger® application. WhatsApp&#xD;
      is a freeware messaging service; it allows streamlining patient-provider communication via&#xD;
      text and voice messages, video clips and images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypotheses are, first, that use of WhatsApp to disseminate information regarding&#xD;
      stones preventive measures will have a substantial positive effect on follow-up compliance&#xD;
      and on patient's adherence to the preventive measures. Second, we expect reduction in&#xD;
      cumulative stone recurrence rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Hypotheses will be tested in a randomized control trial. Participants will be&#xD;
      recruited at the stone clinic of Rabin Medical Center, an academic tertiary hospital.&#xD;
      Participants will randomly assign to one of two groups: A, the experimental group, receiving&#xD;
      stone-prevention information on a monthly basis, and B, the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Based on recurrence rates of previous studies the required number of&#xD;
      patients was calculated in expectation of 20% and 40% cumulative recurrence rate of renal&#xD;
      stones at 5 years in the experimental and control group, respectively. Type 1 error was set&#xD;
      to 5%, and type 2 error was set to 20%. With this assumption, each group has to include 81&#xD;
      patients. Risk and rate ratio of stone recurrence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be&#xD;
      calculated. Loss of patients from follow-up will be measured by proportion of patients lost&#xD;
      at each year.&#xD;
