    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational study is to compare the incidence of relapse in G-CSF/ATG&#xD;
      based and PT-Cy based haploidentical transplantation] in [patients aged 18 to 55 years with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of hematological malignancies who unmanipulated haplo-HSCT with myeloablative&#xD;
      conditioning]. The main question it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To compare the incidence of relapse in G-CSF/ATG based and PT-Cy based&#xD;
      haploidentical transplantation and illustrate the possible immune mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: To compare CMV infection, GVHD and survival outcomes, and to observe&#xD;
      the dynamic immune reconstitution of G-CSF/ATG based or PT-Cy based model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives: To compare the long-term quality of life among recipients who receive&#xD;
      G-CSF/ATG based or PT-Cy based protocol.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in the G-CSF/ATG group received a modified Bu/Cy plus ATG conditioning regimen as follows: cytarabine (4/g m2 per day IV.) on days -10 to -9; Bu (3.2 mg/kg per day IV.) on days -8 to -6; Cy (1.8 g/m2 per day IV.) on days -5 to -4; methyl chloride hexamethylene urea nitrate (Me-CCNU) (250 mg/m2 per day orally) once on day -3; and ATG (2.5 mg/kg per day IV; rabbit, Sang Stat, Lyon, France) on days -5 to -2.</description>

    <arm_group_label>PT-Cy group</arm_group_label>
    <description>Patients in PT-Cy group received a Bu/Flu/Cy-based conditioning regimen as follows: Flu (40 mg/m2 or 1 mg/kg IV) on days -8 to -4; Bu (3.2 mg kg/ d-1 IV) on days -7 to -4; Cy (14.5-40 mg/kg IV) on days -3 to -2;±cytarabine (3 g/m2/d IV) on days -9 to -8; and ± IDA (15 mg/m2/d IV) on days -9 to -8. The addition of IDA and/or cytarabine depended on the performance status of the patients and whether the patients were in relapse status. High-dose PTCy (50 mg/kg/d IV) was administered on days +3 and +4.</description>
