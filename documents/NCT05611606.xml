  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this observational study is to estimate the number of weeks of welfare&#xD;
      benefits, i.e. sickness benefit, unemployment benefit and social assistance, for individuals&#xD;
      with functional somatic disorders and compare them to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. healthy individuals, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. individuals with severe physical disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional somatic disorders (FSD) are common conditions characterized by persistent patterns&#xD;
      of physical symptoms that cannot be better explained by other physical or mental conditions&#xD;
      (1). The conditions may cause severe impairment for the patients who present with reduced&#xD;
      physical and mental health, lower social status, and poor labour market association (2-4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2005, it was estimated that FSD accounted for 3% of hospitalizations and 10-20% of health&#xD;
      care expenses in Denmark (5), and a newer Danish primary care study has shown patients with&#xD;
      FSD to have higher annual health care costs compared with conventionally-defined conditions&#xD;
      (6). In other countries, studies in clinical samples have shown increased direct and indirect&#xD;
      health care costs of FSD (7, 8) showing a dose-response relationship with severity of the FSD&#xD;
      (9). These studies into highly selected clinical samples may induce high risk of selection&#xD;
      bias, and studies including random selected general population samples are therefore needed.&#xD;
      One Canadian population-based study on health care costs of children, adolescents, and young&#xD;
      adults with FSD also found increased health care use and costs for this group (10). Studies&#xD;
      investigating the socioeconomic burden in terms of welfare benefits of FSD in an adult random&#xD;
      sample from the general population are, however, lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To estimate the number of weeks of welfare benefits, i.e. sickness benefit,&#xD;
      unemployment benefit and social assistance, for individuals with FSD and compare them to&#xD;
      individuals without FSD and individuals with severe physical disease.&#xD;

    <description>Data from the DanFunD baseline cohort will be included (11). It comprises a total of 9,656 (33.7% of the invited participants) men and women aged 18-76 years born in Denmark and living in the Western part of greater Copenhagen.&#xD;
Individuals with FSD are identified by means of self-reported questionnaires (n=9,656) (2) and diagnostic research interviews (n=1,590) (12).&#xD;
Participants with FSD will be defined as follows:&#xD;
FSD operationalised by the Bodily Distress Syndrome single- and multi-organ type will be defined with both self-reported questionnaires (14) and diagnostic interviews (3)&#xD;
Three functional somatic syndromes, i.e. irritable bowel (15), chronic widespread pain (16), and chronic fatigue (17) will be defined with questionnaires.&#xD;
Severe physical disease will be defined as having received at least one of the following five diagnoses: Cancer, stroke, myocardial infarction, other heart disease, and obstructive pulmonary disease.</description>

        Participants were randomly drawn from the adult general Danish population by means of the&#xD;
        the Danish Civil Registration system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The DanFunD baseline cohort comprises a total of 9,656 (33.7% of invited participants) men&#xD;
        and women aged 18-76 years, born in Denmark, and living in the Western part of greater&#xD;
        Copenhagen. All participants filled in questionnaires regarding physical symptoms and&#xD;
        psychological factors, among others. A stratified subsample (n=2,450) of every tenth&#xD;
        participant and every symptom high score participant on the DanFunD baseline symptom&#xD;
        questionnaires were invited to participate in a diagnostic interview, the Research&#xD;
        Interview for Functional somatic Disorders (RIFD), performed by trained family physicians&#xD;
        (28); 1,590 (64.9%) accepted and participated in the interview.&#xD;
