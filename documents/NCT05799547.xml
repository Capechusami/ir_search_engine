  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A healthy postpartum period is important for the health of the mother and baby. One of the&#xD;
      main problems that occur after cesarean section, which is a major surgical procedure, is&#xD;
      pain. However, since the mother is in the postpartum period, she may have problems in her own&#xD;
      care, healing process and baby care due to pain. Non-pharmacological treatment is methods&#xD;
      such as massage, acupressure, hot and cold application that can be applied at birth to&#xD;
      support scientific medicine. The cold application examined in our research, is among these&#xD;
      applications. participants will be determined by the block randomization method. Cold&#xD;
      application will be applied to the cesarean section site of the patient for 10 minutes in the&#xD;
      experimental group, followed by a break of 20 minutes, followed by a 10-minute application,&#xD;
      and immediately after the application, the patient will stand up. Only the routine practice&#xD;
      of the clinic will be applied to the control group. Data; will be collected using the&#xD;
      introductory information form, visual analog scale (VAS) and cold application satisfaction&#xD;
      evaluation form. When the studies were examined, no other study was found in the same&#xD;
      application as our study. Therefore, in this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      cold application on the patient's pain during the first leg, the need for painkillers and&#xD;
      satisfaction, due to the higher first take-off pain after cesarean section.&#xD;
