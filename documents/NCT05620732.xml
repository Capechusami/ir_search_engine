  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of advanced pancreatic cancer and gastric cancer needs to be further improved.&#xD;
      Claudin is a kind of integrin membrane protein in the tight junction between epithelium and&#xD;
      endothelium, which is highly expressed in gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer. Preclinical&#xD;
      studies suggest that Claudin18.2CAR-T can effectively improve the remission rate of patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
