    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to compare buprenorphine patch for induction (starting) of&#xD;
      buprenorphine in pregnant patients with opioid use disorder. The main questions it aims to&#xD;
      answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is there a buprenorphine induction method that results in the least moderate-to-severe&#xD;
           opioid withdrawal symptoms in pregnant patients with opioid use disorder?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is there a buprenorphine induction method that results in a higher treatment success&#xD;
           rate? Under normal circumstances, patients who are planning to start sublingual (under&#xD;
           the tongue) buprenorphine for opioid use disorder must first go into withdrawal to start&#xD;
           the medication safely. Study participants will be given a buprenorphine patch during the&#xD;
           required withdrawal period before starting sublingual treatment, and be surveyed daily&#xD;
           by phone to assess their withdrawal symptoms. They will also be followed at prenatal&#xD;
           appointments to evaluate treatment success based on urine drug screen results.&#xD;
           Researchers will compare patients receiving no buprenorphine patch according to the&#xD;
           current standard care protocol.&#xD;
