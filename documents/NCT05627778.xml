      Tumor bone metastasis refers to the metastasis of malignant tumors to the bone through lymph,&#xD;
      blood or direct invasion to generate daughter tumors, which is the most common bone tumor.&#xD;
      More than 40% of patients with malignant tumors will have bone metastasis, among which breast&#xD;
      cancer, prostate cancer is more common, once the tumor cells occur bone metastasis, it means&#xD;
      that the disease enters the advanced stage, posing a serious threat to the life safety of&#xD;
      patients, therefore, early diagnosis of various primary malignant tumor bone metastases, can&#xD;
      lay the foundation for clinical implementation of effective treatment measures. The&#xD;
      laboratory of Hank F. Kung at the University of Pennsylvania has developed a new generation&#xD;
      of 68Ga-labeled radiopharmaceutical P15-041 ([68Ga]Ga-HBED-CC-BP) based on existing&#xD;
      phosphonate-targeting molecular probes (Figure 1). Data from preclinical studies indicate&#xD;
      that P15-041 shows additional advantages in rapid and easy complex formation compared to&#xD;
      current [68Ga]Ga-BPAMD, [68Ga]Ga-NO2AP-BP, [68Ga]Ga-DOTA- (ZOL). In vivo experiments, P15-041&#xD;
      showed good bone resorption and rapid renal excretion in normal mice. Haiyan Hong et al. [13]&#xD;
      prepared multiple clinical doses of P15-041 and successfully evaluated it in patients,&#xD;
      followed by intravenous P15-041, followed by a whole body PET/CT scan. Robert K. Doot et al.&#xD;
      conducted dosimetric experiments on P15-041, analyzed the radioactive distribution of the&#xD;
      drug in normal organs and the dynamic change of the dose of the drug in the body over time,&#xD;
      and the results showed that P15-041 had high uptake in the bladder wall and bone cortex,&#xD;
      blood and other tissues cleared quickly, and there was obvious radioactive enrichment in the&#xD;
      myocardium in the early stage of imaging, and P15-041 had the potential to become a new&#xD;
      generation of excellent phosphonate molecular probes.&#xD;

      Tumor bone metastasis (Tumor Bone Metastasis) refers to the metastasis of malignant tumor to&#xD;
      the bone through lymphatic, blood or direct infiltration, resulting in sub-tumor, which is&#xD;
      the most common bone tumor. More than 40% of patients with malignant tumors will develop bone&#xD;
      metastasis, among which breast cancer and prostate cancer are more common. Once bone&#xD;
      metastasis occurs in tumor cells, it means that the disease has entered an advanced stage and&#xD;
      poses a serious threat to the life safety of patients. Therefore, early diagnosis Bone&#xD;
      metastases from various primary malignant tumors can lay the foundation for the clinical&#xD;
      implementation of effective treatment measures. At present, single photon emission&#xD;
      computer-aided tomography (SPECT) technetium-99 (99mTc)-methylenediphos-phonate (MDP) is the&#xD;
      preferred method for early diagnosis of tumor bone metastases , but benign bone Disease (such&#xD;
      as bone degeneration, trauma, inflammatory response) and reactive changes during treatment&#xD;
      ((scintillation phenomenon) can also be manifested as abnormal radioactive concentrations,&#xD;
      with the possibility of false positives . Positron emission tomography Imaging (PET)&#xD;
      technology is a nuclear medicine imaging method that integrates anatomical images of diseases&#xD;
      and functional metabolism. It combines radioisotopes with compounds to achieve the function&#xD;
      of imaging the metabolism of targeted substances. Compared with other imaging methods, PET&#xD;
      molecular probes have higher sensitivity. Clinically, [18F]F-FDG PET/CT is commonly used to&#xD;
      observe the metabolic status of bone metastases, which can show bone metastases that have not&#xD;
      yet undergone osteogenesis or osteolysis. Vine-labeled phosphonates are bone imaging agents&#xD;
      commonly used clinically to evaluate bone diseases such as infection (osteomyelitis),&#xD;
      noninfectious inflammation (arthritis), trauma, metabolic bone disease, benign and malignant&#xD;
      tumors, and metastases. ), the imaging agent reaches the bones of the whole body with the&#xD;
      blood flow through intravenous injection, and is distributed in the bone tissue through ion&#xD;
      exchange and chemical adsorption with the hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone, and the newly&#xD;
      formed collagen has a higher effect on the bone imaging agent. Recent studies have shown&#xD;
      that, the uptake mechanism of radionuclide-labeled phosphonates such as [99mTc]Tc-DPD,&#xD;
      [99mTc]Tc-HMDP and [99mTc]Tc-PYP in amyloid myocardial deposition It is not fully understood,&#xD;
      but some investigators have evaluated biopsies and found that microcalcifications are often&#xD;
      present in cardiac amyloid deposits and may be associated with positive phosphonate imaging.&#xD;
      However, [99mTc]Tc imaging agents are still not effective for Quantitative assessment of&#xD;
      amyloid deposition. Recently, with the successful application of 68Ga-somatostatin receptor&#xD;
      imaging agents in PET/CT, people have gradually shifted their attention to the &quot;new&#xD;
      generation&quot; positron nuclides 68Ga, 68Ge /68Ga radionuclide generator can prepare 68Ga based&#xD;
      PET tracer without adjacent cyclotron, in addition, 68Ga excellent physical properties (t1/2:&#xD;
      68min; 89%Î²+, 1.92mev maximum energy) Suitable for PET imaging, therefore, the development of&#xD;
      bisphosphonates labeled with 68Ga will meet the need for a source of PET tracers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the existing phosphonate-targeted molecular probes, the Hank F. Kung laboratory at&#xD;
      the University of Pennsylvania has developed a new generation of 68Ga-labeled&#xD;
      radiopharmaceutical P15-041 ([68Ga]Ga-HBED-CC-BP). Preclinical data show that P15-041&#xD;
      exhibits rapid and facile complex formation compared to current [68Ga]Ga-BPAMD,&#xD;
      [68Ga]Ga-NO2AP-BP, [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-(ZOL) an additional advantage. In in vivo experiments,&#xD;
      P15-041 exhibited good bone resorption and rapid renal excretion in normal mice. Haiyan Hong&#xD;
      et al. [13] prepared various clinical doses of P15-041 and successfully evaluated them in&#xD;
      patients who performed whole-body PET/CT scans after intravenous administration of P15-041.&#xD;
      Robert K. Doot et al conducted a dosimetry test on P15-041, and analyzed the radioactive&#xD;
      distribution of the drug in normal organs and the dynamic changes of the drug in vivo with&#xD;
      time. The cortical bone uptake is high, the blood and other tissues are cleared quickly, and&#xD;
      there is obvious radioactive enrichment in the myocardium in the early stage of imaging.&#xD;
      P15-041 has the potential to become a new generation of excellent phosphonate molecular&#xD;
      probes.&#xD;
