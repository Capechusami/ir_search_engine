  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The physical and social effects of exercise programs and daily exercise have already been&#xD;
      demonstrated in stroke. However, stroke survivors have shown a passive attitude towards the&#xD;
      exercise program and there was little guideline and experience of the stroke exercise program&#xD;
      in the community. Therefore, the study provides patients with an adequate guide to a complex&#xD;
      exercise program after discharge based on the medical records.&#xD;
