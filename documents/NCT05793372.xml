  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Age is its main risk&#xD;
      factor. AD is a multifactorial disease, combining genetic and environmental risk factors.&#xD;
      Autosomal dominant mutations have been identified (PSEN1, PSEN2, APP), leading to earlier and&#xD;
      more severe forms of the disease. Other genetic risk factors have been identified, such as&#xD;
      the Îµ4 allele of the APOE gene. . The environment also plays a major role, with the&#xD;
      identification of several risk factors such as air pollution or nutritional deficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AD patients frequently present hyperhomocysteinemia, a consequence of a dysfunction of&#xD;
      monocarbon metabolism. Homocysteine is an amino acid involved in the metabolism of methionine&#xD;
      and cysteine. High concentrations of homocysteine can be deleterious to the central nervous&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most prospective studies have shown that elevated homocysteine is a predictor of undefined&#xD;
      cognitive impairment or AD. Other studies have focused on clinical data and, in particular,&#xD;
      on cognitive function. For example, a meta-analysis found an inverse correlation between MMSE&#xD;
      score and homocysteine level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, our study seeks to evaluate the impact of hyperhomocysteinemia on the severity and&#xD;
      early onset of AD, while knowing the presence or absence of genetic risk factors associated&#xD;
      with AD.&#xD;
