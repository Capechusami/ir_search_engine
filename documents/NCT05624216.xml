  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of radiofrequency heating and&#xD;
      targeted pressure energy for reduction in the appearance or cellulite. The study is a&#xD;
      prospective multi-center open-label single-arm study. Subjects will be required to complete&#xD;
      four (4) treatment visits and two to three follow-up visits - 1, 3 and 6 months after the&#xD;
      last therapy visit. All of the study subjects will receive the treatment with the subject&#xD;
      device.&#xD;

      This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of radiofrequency heating and&#xD;
      targeted pressure energy for reduction in the appearance or cellulite. The study is a&#xD;
      prospective multi-center open-label single-arm study. Subjects will be required to complete&#xD;
      four (4) treatment visits and two to three follow-up visits - 1, 3 and 6 months after the&#xD;
      last therapy visit. All of the study subjects will receive the treatment with the subject&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit subject's weight will be recorded, together with hip and thigh&#xD;
      circumference. In addition, photographs of the treated area will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment administration phase will consist of four (4) treatments, delivered in 2-4&#xD;
      weeks. The applicator will be applied over the treatment area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the last therapy visit, the subject's weight will be recorded, together with hip and thigh&#xD;
      circumference. Photographs of the treated area will be taken. In addition, subjects will&#xD;
      receive Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire and Therapy Comfort Questionnaire to fill in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety measures will include documentation of adverse events (AE). Following each treatment&#xD;
      administration and at all of the follow-up visits, subjects will be checked for immediate&#xD;
      post-procedure adverse event assessment.&#xD;

    <measure>Evaluation of cellulite severity change based on photographs before and after the study procedure according to the Cellulite Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Three independent evaluators will evaluate photographs for a level of cellulite severity by assigning a score according to the Cellulite Severity Scale (CSS) validated by Hexsel et al. After follow-up visits are conducted, evaluators will be given a set of the coded photographs from each subject for an evaluation. The Cellulite Severity Scale evaluates five key morphological features of cellulite; number of depressions, depth of depressions, clinical appearance of evident raised lesions, presence of flaccidity and the grade of cellulite. Each item is graded from 0 to 3, allowing final classification of cellulite as mild, moderate and severe.</description>

    <measure>Photography evaluation according to the Global Aesthetic Improvement scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Three independent evaluators will evaluate photographs for a level of appearance change by assigning a score according to the Global Aesthetic Improvement scale, where the lowest possible grade is (-1), worsened state and the highest is (3) very much improved.</description>

    <measure>Therapy Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-point scale will be used for evaluating the comfort during the study treatment. Subjects will be evaluating the comfort/discomfort on a scale from 1 (&quot;No discomfort&quot;) to 10 (&quot;Unbearable discomfort&quot;)</description>

    <measure>Subject Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-point Likert scale Satisfaction questionnaire will be used to evaluate the participant's satisfaction with the therapy outcome. The subjects will be answering questions with possible answers varying from &quot;Strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly agree&quot;</description>
