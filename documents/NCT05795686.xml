  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, more than 150,000 strokes occur each year. Stroke is a major risk factor for&#xD;
      dependency, representing the leading cause of acquired non-traumatic disability in adults.&#xD;
      Head injuries, which are also very frequent, can leave similar neuropsychiatric sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These events are brutal and their physical, psychological, emotional, social and financial&#xD;
      consequences disrupt the lives of patients and their families. Thanks to improved access to&#xD;
      thrombolysis and thrombectomy for the management of acute stroke, the prognosis has been&#xD;
      profoundly improved. Nevertheless, the increase in post-stroke survival and the evolution of&#xD;
      the type of after-effects require the development of support systems dedicated to these&#xD;
      post-stroke patients. The same issues are raised for people who have suffered a head injury&#xD;
      with similar consequences that require specialised care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, health care is well structured for the acute phase and there is an improvement in&#xD;
      the provision of care in specialised rehabilitation services, but the dedicated medico-social&#xD;
      provision for people returning home remains insufficient despite the significant needs. The&#xD;
      ARRPAC association (Accompaniment, Rehabilitation, Respite after Stroke and Cerebral Palsy)&#xD;
      is setting up a new comprehensive medico-social support programme in Lyon (AVanCer programme,&#xD;
      opening in June 2022) to improve the autonomy and adaptation capacities of patients and to&#xD;
      relieve the social and psycho-affective burden of carers. This experimental day centre, which&#xD;
      complements functional rehabilitation and recurrence prevention care, offers adults with&#xD;
      brain injury sequelae and their carers therapeutic education programmes, adapted physical&#xD;
      activity, social and cognitive remediation and therapeutic workshops, as well as a place for&#xD;
      patients and their carers to exchange information and listen. To achieve its ambition, ARRPAC&#xD;
      and the AVanCer programme must be integrated into the existing support offer, create&#xD;
      partnerships with care structures and evaluate its added value to ensure its sustainability.&#xD;
      In case of efficiency and demonstrated benefits for patients, carers and the health system,&#xD;
      such a structure could be deployed in other territories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the implementation of the AVanCer programme in terms of its effect on&#xD;
      the target audience, participants' experience and implementation according to the REAIM&#xD;
      evaluative framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance).&#xD;

    <description>The GAS will quantify the achievement of the goals set by the patient. It will be calculated at the end of the programme (planned end or premature exit) on the basis of the objectives set when the patient was included in the programme. The objectives and the different steps to reach them are defined in consultation between the patient, the doctor and the nurse.&#xD;
It is a 5-point scale (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2); -2: level before participation, -1: less than expected; 0: expected goal achieved; +1: a little more than expected; +2: best possible outcome expected.</description>
