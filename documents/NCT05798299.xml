  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UP-C is a manualized, cognitive-behavioral, and emotion-focused group intervention with a&#xD;
      transdiagnostic approach aimed at the treatment of emotional problems (i.e., anxiety and&#xD;
      depression) in children aged 7 to 12 years old. This psychological intervention mainly&#xD;
      focuses on reducing the intensity and frequency of strong and aversive emotional experiences&#xD;
      in children through the development of skills that allow them to face these emotions in a&#xD;
      more adaptive way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By targeting the factors common to emotional disorders (avoidance, emotional reactivity,&#xD;
      affective intolerance) we believe this intervention might increase the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      treatment of these difficulties (mainly in the cases where comorbidity is present). It may&#xD;
      also contribute to therapists' expertise when dealing with different emotional disorders, by&#xD;
      not requiring the simultaneous mastery of multiple interventions, to a reduction of costs&#xD;
      associated with training and to the planning of more individualized and flexible&#xD;
      interventions. This approach could help to make interventions suitable for a set of problems&#xD;
      more accessible to the public - which is particularly relevant to the Portuguese context.&#xD;
      Thus, to better adapt to the limitations existent in mental health services in Portugal, a&#xD;
      modified version of the UP-C was developed by reducing the number of sessions for parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study seeks to understand whether this adapted version of the UP-C - the UP-C/C -&#xD;
      less demanding in terms of resources required for its application, is effective in reducing&#xD;
      children's emotional symptomatology and produces changes on maladaptive parenting strategies&#xD;
      used by parents. This version is mostly centered on the child, who participates in 15, 90&#xD;
      minutes, group sessions. In this version of the program, the parents adopt the role of&#xD;
      &quot;cotherapists&quot;, and support homework completion at home by the child. They also have access&#xD;
      to psychoeducational material (in video and written format). Additionally, the UP-C/C&#xD;
      includes three parental sessions that focus on parenting strategies shown to be useful in&#xD;
      challenging situations. This study also seeks to evaluate child and parent involvement in the&#xD;
      intervention and understand its predictors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These are the specific objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the efficacy of the UP-C/C through a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial&#xD;
           with two conditions (UP-C/C and Coping Cat in group format) on the primary outcomes&#xD;
           (child's anxiety and depression symptoms, interference of anxiety and depression in the&#xD;
           child's school, social and family functioning), secondary (quality of life, emotional&#xD;
           expression and cognitive errors), and on the transdiagnostic factors (avoidance,&#xD;
           emotional reactivity, affective intolerance) and on the parental variables (parents'&#xD;
           emotional behaviors, orientation towards the child's emotions, symptoms of anxiety and&#xD;
           depression);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the involvement of the child and parents in the program (attendance,&#xD;
           dropout, active participation) and find out its predictors (age; intensity of symptoms;&#xD;
           readiness for change; therapeutic alliance; expectations regarding the intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis of the study, relating to the efficacy study, is the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - UP-C/C is expected to have equivalent results to Group Coping Cat in outcomes related to&#xD;
      anxiety and quality of life and superior results in outcomes related to depression and&#xD;
      transdiagnostic mechanisms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited from schools located in Lisbon's metropolitan area (Portugal).&#xD;
      The selection of participants will be carried out through a two-phase screening, after&#xD;
      parental consent and assent from the children are obtained. In both phases, the children will&#xD;
      complete a questionnaire that assesses symptoms of anxiety and depression. Children whose&#xD;
      score in the screening of anxiety symptoms is in a percentile equal to or greater than 80&#xD;
      will be selected at both assessment times. Families of children selected through the&#xD;
      screening are invited to an individual assessment session. In this session, a brief set of&#xD;
      questions to parents is asked to ensure their child's eligibility, and current difficulties&#xD;
      are explored in more detail. If the necessary criteria are met, the pre-intervention&#xD;
      evaluation processes take place (child and caregivers complete a set of measures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To access the efficacy of the UP-C/C, this intervention will be compared with a&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral intervention previously shown to be effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      anxiety disorders, the Coping Cat program in a group format. Thus, once the recruitment and&#xD;
      evaluation of eligibility criteria is finished, the children and their parents will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to one of two conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. experimental group (i.e., children and parents who benefit from the UP-C/C program);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. control group (i.e., children who benefit from the Coping Cat, group format).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both conditions, 15/16 weekly sessions with the children will take place in groups of 5 to&#xD;
      7 participants. Therapist's and children's manuals are available. The groups will be&#xD;
      conducted by clinical psychologists integrated in the research team. All therapists received&#xD;
      training to conduct the intervention and will receive weekly supervision by the project&#xD;
      supervisor. Every session will be observed and evaluated by an external observer through a&#xD;
      checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the primary and secondary outcomes, transdiagnostic mechanisms and parental&#xD;
      variables, the study includes 5 assessment times - at pre-intervention, 6 weeks after the&#xD;
      start of the intervention, after the intervention ends and at two follow-ups, 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      after the end of the intervention. The variables related to the therapeutic process are&#xD;
      evaluated at each session (active participation, assessment of program conduction,&#xD;
      therapeutic alliance) and in the 1st session (readiness for change). Informed consent, from&#xD;
      the parents and the children, will be sought at each assessment time. Consent protocol&#xD;
      includes a paragraph, that explains how data will be recorded and who has access to it. Only&#xD;
      information relevant to the study is collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis of the effects of the intervention, a multivariate analysis of variance&#xD;
      (MANOVA) (SPSS 26.0) will be used. To assess participants' engagement in the UP-C/C, data&#xD;
      will be collected from all sessions and percentages of attendance and dropout will be&#xD;
      calculated. ANOVA analysis of variance and Chi-Square tests (SPSS 26.0) will be used to&#xD;
      examine differences between the Experimental Group and the Control Group in attendance/active&#xD;
      participation and dropout, respectively. To explore predictors of attendance/active&#xD;
      participation and dropout Multiple Regressions and Logistic Regressions (SPSS 26.0) will be&#xD;
      used, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a mean effect size of 0.4 on improvement in depressive symptomatology, an&#xD;
      alpha=0.05, and power=0.8, for a 2-group design with 5 repeated measures, the total sample&#xD;
      size required is 80 (G*Power). Given an expected dropout of 17%, it will be necessary to&#xD;
      recruit a minimum of approximately 94 children. Thus, a sample of 47 children in the&#xD;
      experimental group and 47 in the control group is expected. 7 UP-C/C groups with a maximum&#xD;
      number of 7 children will be conducted. To allow for a satisfactory number of participants,&#xD;
      the therapeutic groups will be carried out in two periods (March 2023 to July 2023 and&#xD;
      October 2024 to February 2024).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data due to participant's dropout will be handled by intention-to-treat principles,&#xD;
      estimated using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method.&#xD;
