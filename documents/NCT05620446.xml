      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sigmoid volvulus is a surgical emergency and if untreated, it will lead to bowel ischemia &amp;&#xD;
      perforation with high incidence of mortality (1). Most of the patients with sigmoid volvulus&#xD;
      are old age with many co-morbidities (2). So, the risk of surgery for those elderly patients&#xD;
      is high and is associated with high incidence of morbidity &amp; mortality (3) . Early&#xD;
      intervention is required for managing the sigmoid volvulus to avoid its serious complications&#xD;
      , so the less invasive intervention is the best for those high risk elderly patients (4) .&#xD;
      Usually in the past after failure of deflating rectal tube to untwist the volvulus , the&#xD;
      patients were subjected for surgical colostomy to relive the intestinal obstruction with high&#xD;
      risk consent for elderly patients then in later session , they were subjected for definitive&#xD;
      surgery (5) . As the emergency surgery is associated with high incidence of morbidity &amp;&#xD;
      mortality in elderly patients, so the endoscopic approach becomes the first line of&#xD;
      management to resolve the obstruction in uncomplicated sigmoid volvulus in elderly patients&#xD;
      (6). The endoscopic untwist of the acute sigmoid volvulus was first described by Bruusgaard&#xD;
      and had the advantage of both diagnostic &amp; therapeutic values (7) . For diagnostic value, the&#xD;
      endoscopy evaluate the mucosa and its viability , it is also important to exclude other&#xD;
      causes of intestinal obstruction , the length of the endoscopy is enough to reach beyond site&#xD;
      of twist and diagnose the torsion as the site of twist appears spiral , sphincter area of the&#xD;
      mucosa (8). For therapeutic value , it is successful in treating the acute volvulus by&#xD;
      incidence of 75%-95% , but with high recurrence rate up to 90% (9). The elective definitive&#xD;
      surgery few days later after the endoscopy was postponed in elderly patients for many reasons&#xD;
      , so in our study we will try to fix the sigmoid colon also by endoscopy without needs for&#xD;
      general anesthesia and major surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the advantages and safety of Endoscopic management of acute sigmoid volvulus in&#xD;
      high risk surgical patients and its effect in reducing morbidity and postoperative hospital&#xD;
      stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods Patients This prospective randomized controlled clinical trial included&#xD;
      all patients who developed the manifestations of acute a cute sigmoid volvulus and referred&#xD;
      to the Zagazig University Hospital Emergency Department between December 2020 and August&#xD;
      2022. The study was prospectively approved by Zagazig University Faculty of Medicine&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board (Approval Number: 9989/23-10-2022), and was retrospectively&#xD;
      submitted in clinicaltrials.gov in November 2022 (NCT05051683). The study was performed in&#xD;
      accordance with the code of ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki)&#xD;
      for studies involving human subjects. Written informed consent was obtained from all&#xD;
      participants after explaining to them all the study procedures with its benefits and hazards.&#xD;
      Patients with age of ≥60 years-old , with acute sigmoid volvulus not managed by rectal&#xD;
      deflating tube, with no evidence of bowel ischemia, with ASA III &amp; IV , high risk surgical&#xD;
      patients , with comorbidities and on sepsis but not septic shock were included and eligible&#xD;
      for randomization. We excluded patients who were with good general condition (ASAI&amp;II),&#xD;
      patients with age below 60 years , patients with bowel ischemia and patients managed by&#xD;
      rectal deflating tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included eligible patients were simply randomized at a 1:1 ratio to &quot;Endoscopic (SG)&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;Surgical Colostomy Group (EG)&quot; via the drawing of sealed envelopes containing&#xD;
      computer-generated random numbers prepared by a third party before the start of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated by using open Epi program depending on the following data ;&#xD;
      confidence interval 95% , power of the test 80% , ratio of unexposed/ exposed 1 , the success&#xD;
      rate of surgical colostomy versus endoscopic colostomy was 90 % versus 15% respectively. Odd&#xD;
      ratio 0.02 , and risk ratio 0.17 , so the calculated sample size equal 18 patients divided&#xD;
      into two equal groups. Primary and secondary outcomes were success rate in managing the&#xD;
      obstruction , postoperative hospital stay, and complications and mortality in each group&#xD;
      after the intervention during the 3-months follow-up period, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis After full history taking and complete physical examination, acute sigmoid volvulus&#xD;
      was clinically suspected and then confirmed by laboratory investigations (complete blood&#xD;
      picture, liver and kidney functions, coagulation profile), radiological imaging (plain erect&#xD;
      chest X-ray abdomen, abdominal US , CT abdomen with oral and I.V contrast and virtual&#xD;
      colonscopy ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group A ( endoscopy group ): after admission of the patients to the emergency department&#xD;
      &amp; confirmation of the diagnosis , the included patients in this group were subjected for&#xD;
      rapid resuscitation in ICU or inpatient bed according to patient's general condition then&#xD;
      rapidly were subjected for colonoscopy under sedation in operative room to untwist the&#xD;
      volvulus by passing the colonoscopy (CF260 series; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) to site of volvulus&#xD;
      which was appeared as spiral &amp; sphincter area of the mucosa . The untwist was done under&#xD;
      radiological guidance of C-arm by gas suction &amp; insufflation till untwisting was occurred .&#xD;
      Then rectal tube was put to avoid recurrence of volvulus and also for washing &amp; irrigation of&#xD;
      the colon by ringer or saline solution ( 500cc /8h for one or two days ) at inpatient bed or&#xD;
      ICU bed according to patient's general condition to get the colon empty from stool. After&#xD;
      that patients ( after one or two days ) the patients were shifted again to operative room for&#xD;
      sigmoid colon fixation by endoscopy as following : the technique was done by two doctor ( one&#xD;
      for endoscopy and the other for sigmoid fixation ) the patients were sedated after&#xD;
      intravenous preoperative ceftriaxone &amp; metronidazole injection , then colonoscopy was done&#xD;
      for the patients while the patients were put in lithotomy position , we identified the site&#xD;
      of sigmoid colon fixation by radiological colongraphy by injection of radio-opaque dye via&#xD;
      the endoscopy then tip of artery forceps was moved at outer skin at anterior abdominal wall&#xD;
      at left lower quadrant to meet tip of colonscopy at multiple point where fixation was done (&#xD;
      at least 4 to 5 points of fixation ) . fixation was done by exploratory puncture of skin by&#xD;
      scalpel about (2-3 mm puncture) at site of these points then widening the puncture by artery&#xD;
      forceps at level of subcutaneous tissue. A 2- shot anchor device ( Olympus, Tokyo , Japan)&#xD;
      was used to fix the sigmoid colon against anterior abdominal wall. After exploratory puncture&#xD;
      was done , a 20-gauge needle was used for further confirmation of site of fixation. A suction&#xD;
      test was performed to exclude presence of intervening organ between sigmoid colon and&#xD;
      anterior abdominal wall. The 2-shot anchor device was passed through the puncture to be&#xD;
      entered inside the sigmoid colon and the thread with a metal T-bar was detached and pulled&#xD;
      towards the anterior abdominal wall. This was repeated at multiple point of fixation (4-5&#xD;
      points of fixation ). Ct-colongraphy ( virtual colongraphy ) was done on next day at morning&#xD;
      before patient's discharge to confirm sigmoid fixation and avoid missing any leak .&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group B ( surgical group ) : after admission of the patients to the emergency department&#xD;
      &amp; confirmation of the diagnosis , the included patients in this group were subjected for&#xD;
      rapid resuscitation in ICU or inpatient bed according to patient's general condition then&#xD;
      rapidly were subjected for surgical colostomy ( hartman's procedure ) , then later on after 6&#xD;
      weeks , they were subjected for surgical sigmoid fixation or excision either by open or&#xD;
      laparoscopic approach . In this group , the patients were discharged after colostomy then&#xD;
      readmission again after 6 weeks for definitive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Analysis of data was performed using SPSS (Statistical Package of Social&#xD;
      Services) version 22. Quantitative variables were described as mean (±SD, standard deviation)&#xD;
      and median (range) according to Shapiro test of normality. Qualitative variables were&#xD;
      described as a number and a percent. Chi-square test was used to compare qualitative&#xD;
      variables between the 2 groups. Fisher exact test was used when one expected cell or more are&#xD;
      less than 5. Unpaired t-test was used to compare quantitative variables, in parametric data&#xD;
      (SD &lt; 30% of the mean). Mann Whitney test was used instead of unpaired t-test in&#xD;
      non-parametric data (SD &gt; 30% of the mean). The results were considered statistically&#xD;
      significant when the significant probability was less than 0.05 (P &lt; 0.05). P-value &lt; 0.001&#xD;
      was considered highly statistically significant (HS), and P-value ≥ 0.05 was considered&#xD;
      statistically insignificant (NS)(10).&#xD;
