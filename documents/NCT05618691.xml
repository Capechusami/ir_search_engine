  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GFH312 could be a novel therapeutic option in the acute/chronic inflammatory process of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and provides potential beneficial effects to microvasculature function for&#xD;
      PAD patients with IC in addition to preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury. This phase II&#xD;
      study is designed to explore the clinical safety and efficacy of GFH312 after multiple oral&#xD;
      doses, to support further development in patients with PAD or other atherosclerotic diseases.&#xD;
