      Synopsis Rationale Patients with T1 urinary bladder cancer (UBC) are at high risk for&#xD;
      recurrence and progression. However, the prognosis is dependent on several concomitant&#xD;
      factors. First and foremost, an accurate diagnosis is imperative for an appropriate disease&#xD;
      management. Due to conventional transurethral resection technique, resulting in fragmentation&#xD;
      and cauterization of the tissue, the pathological review is often difficult and may result in&#xD;
      under or over-staging. A central pathology review of EORTC trial data found only a 43%&#xD;
      concordance for T1 tumours compared with staging by a local pathologist. Moreover, risk&#xD;
      factors such as concomitant carcinoma in situ (CIS), variant histology (VH) and&#xD;
      lymphovascular invasion (LVI) have been associated with even poorer prognosis in patients&#xD;
      with T1 UBC. However, there is consistent heterogeneity in reporting these features across&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an unmet need for a clean prospective dataset on T1 UBC to allow an accurate risk&#xD;
      stratification in order to aid clinical decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints The primary objective of the study is to prospectively collect data on&#xD;
      patients with primary diagnosis of T1 NMIBC in order&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to investigate the therapy failure rates in patients with primary diagnosis of T1&#xD;
           bladder cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to investigate the association of clinico-pathologic features such as LVI, VH and CIS,&#xD;
           tumor size and number of tumors with pathologic outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to analyze the accuracy of the local pathologist assessment on the evaluation of&#xD;
           pathology features such as tumor stage and grade, substaging according to the&#xD;
           microscopic and extensive invasion, LVI, VH and CIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to investigate the inter-observer variability among different local pathologist&#xD;
           comparing these observations with a central pathology revision performed by expert&#xD;
           genitourinary pathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to develop a clinically applicable risk stratification tool which may guide physicians&#xD;
           during patient counselling and decision-making regrading adjuvant therapies or early&#xD;
           cystectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Patients with primary diagnosis of UBC and scheduled for transurethral resection of&#xD;
      bladder at international urology departments will be prospectively recruited. Patients with&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of T1 UBC will be included in the study All selected patients will be&#xD;
      asked to sign a written informed consent and any locally required privacy act document&#xD;
      authorization prior to TURB. Furthermore, all patients will be required to provide consent&#xD;
      for central pathology revision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive adjuvant treatments (i.e. intravesical therapy or early cystectomy)&#xD;
      according to guidelines and clinical standards. All data regarding these treatments will be&#xD;
      prospectively collected during the study period or patient death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical data of patients included in the study will be prospectively collected at each&#xD;
      center and saved within an electronic case report form (eCRF) using the Castor platform&#xD;
      (Castor www.castoredc.com). After combining the data sets from the different centers, reports&#xD;
      will be generated for each variable identifying missing or inconsistent data. Incongruities&#xD;
      will be solved before freezing the final database. Protected health information (PHI) will be&#xD;
      unavailable to investigators at other sites. Follow-up chart abstractions will occur at&#xD;
      6-month intervals until the patient is deceased, lost to follow-up, or the study is&#xD;
      terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathologic specimens will be scanned and uploaded to the eCRF to allow a central pathologic&#xD;
      revision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for patient number Recurrence rates for T1 bladder cancer are estimated to be up to&#xD;
      50% [4]. We plan to include 700 patients in the study. This would allow to detect a 50%&#xD;
      failure rate with 4% on either side of the 95% Confidence Interval (proportion 0,50 with&#xD;
      95%CI 0.46-0.54).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future prospects, dissemination and impact A manuscript will be written and submitted for&#xD;
      publication on a scientific journal. Any formal presentation or publication of data collected&#xD;
      from this trial will be considered as a joint publication by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies originating from this registry could potentially change the risk stratification and,&#xD;
      therefore, the management of patients with T1 UBC.&#xD;
