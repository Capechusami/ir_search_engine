  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      QL0911, a recombinant human thrombopoietin mimetic peptide-Fc fusion protein for injection,&#xD;
      is a romiplostim (Nplate®) biosimilar for the treatment of primary immune thrombocytopenia&#xD;
      (ITP). This phase III study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of QL0911 in adult&#xD;
      patients with primary chronic ITP.&#xD;

      This study consisted of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 26-week treatment&#xD;
      period, sequentially followed by an open-label, single-arm, 12-week treatment period, and an&#xD;
      additional 4-week safety follow-up period.&#xD;
