  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b open-label, single arm, multicenter, study of ALRN-6924 as a&#xD;
      chemoprotection agent in patients with TP53-mutated HER2- breast cancer (stages IIa to IIIb)&#xD;
      receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin, docetaxel, and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide (TAC). Chemotherapy affects cells that are dividing, whether they are tumor&#xD;
      cells or healthy cells (including, bone marrow cells, hair follicle cells, and epithelial&#xD;
      cells lining the gastrointestinal tract). ALRN-6924 is designed to stop cell division in&#xD;
      healthy cells but not in tumor cells because they have a mutation of the TP53 gene. When this&#xD;
      happens, tumor cells will still be destroyed by the chemotherapy but healthy cells that are&#xD;
      not dividing may be spared from chemotherapy damage and the patient should have less side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial for evaluation of&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and chemoprotection effects of ALRN-6924 combined with chemotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with TP53-mutated, HER2 negative breast cancer without distant organ metastases. All&#xD;
      patients will receive the neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy regimen known as TAC. TAC&#xD;
      consists of doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 IV infusion, docetaxel 75mg/m2 IV infusion and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 IV infusion, given on Day 1 of every 3-week cycle for a total of&#xD;
      4-6 treatment cycles according to each patient's individual needs, individual institutional&#xD;
      policies and standards of care, as well as investigator discretion. ALRN-6924 1.2 mg/kg will&#xD;
      be administered on 3 consecutive days in each treatment cycle, Days 0-2. Prophylactic&#xD;
      administration of G-CSF prior to the first instance of Grade 4 neutropenia is not allowed in&#xD;
      Cycle 1. Myeloid growth factor support with filgrastim should be administered immediately if&#xD;
      a patient is diagnosed with Grade 4 neutropenia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study has been terminated early given that the first four patients enrolled have&#xD;
    experienced Grade 4 neutropenia and alopecia after cycle 1 and as such failed to meet the&#xD;
    primary endpoint and the main secondary endpoint.&#xD;
