  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of a single&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection of HBM9378 (SKB378) at different doses in healthy Chinese subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of one dose esclation part with a total of 5 dose levels. The Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive HBM9378 as reflected by the guiding principle for the dose&#xD;
      esclation/expansion phase. Each dose group includes a screening period, a baseline period, an&#xD;
      observational period, and a safety follow-up period.&#xD;
