    <description>Change from base line to follow up of 3 months, Nurses knowledge and competency regarding dysphagia scale is self developed scale. The scale include items related to anatomy physiology, risk factors, sign and symptoms, complications, screening, and management measured on 11 point scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The simulation Design scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1st day</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline, The simulation design scale is twenty item five point scale. It is used to evaluate design features of simulation. The instrument is divided into two parts: one part is about the presence of specific features in the simulation, while the other part is about the importance of those features to the learner. The rating of the specific features is from 1 to 5 where 1 is strongly disagree with the statement and 5 is strongly agree with the statement. Importance part is rated from 1 to 5 where 1 is not important and 5 is very important</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Educational practice questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1st day</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline, Educational practice questionnaire consists of sixteen items and is five point scale. It is used to measure educational practices. The rating of the educational practices is from 1 to 5 where 1 is strongly disagree with the statement and 5 is strongly agree with the statement. Importance part is rated from 1 to 5 where 1 is not important and 5 is very important</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Student satisfaction and self confidence in learning</measure>
    <time_frame>1st day</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline, Student satisfaction and self confidence in learning is 13 item scale and is used to measure students satisfaction with simulation activity and self confidence in learning. Student satisfaction and self confidence in learning is rated from 1 to 5 where 1 is strongly disagree with the statement and 5 as strongly agree with the statement</description>
