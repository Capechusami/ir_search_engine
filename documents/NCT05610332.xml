      To evaluate the clinical efficacy of albumin paclitaxel combined with carelizumab and FLOT in&#xD;

      Background: At present, there is still a lack of prospective data to systematically compare&#xD;
      the clinical efficacy of different neoadjuvant therapies in patients with different&#xD;
      genotypes. To explore the clinical efficacy and safety of albumin paclitaxel combined with&#xD;
      carrelizumab compared with FLOT neoadjuvant therapy in patients with locally advanced gastric&#xD;
      cancer of different immune types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study is a multi center prospective study. 216 patients with gastric&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma were included in the study to explore the proportion of PD-L1 positive cells&#xD;
      in tumor tissue, evaluate the expression of PD-L1, serum HBV DNA level or other biomarkers.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <description>Exosomes were isolated using a Backman Optima XPN-100 instrument. The exosomes morphology was characterized using a HT7700 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Co. Ltd., Japan). Fluorescent spectra were recorded using a F96 Pro fluorospectrophotometer (Shanghai Lengguang Technology). The concentration and size distribution of the exosomes were quantified using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NanoSight NS 300, Malvern Instrument). The obtained results were subjected to biostatistical analysis, such as heat map generation, ROC curve establishment, and confusion matrix.</description>
