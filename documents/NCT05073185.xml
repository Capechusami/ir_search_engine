  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strong empirical evidence shows food marketing promotes excess energy intake and obesity.&#xD;
      Yet, not all children are susceptible to its effects and this variability is poorly&#xD;
      understood. Identifying sources of this variability is a public health priority not only&#xD;
      because it may elucidate characteristics of children who are most susceptible, but also&#xD;
      because it may highlight novel sources of resiliency to overconsumption. The proposed&#xD;
      research will use state-of-the art, data-driven approaches to identify neural, cognitive and&#xD;
      behavioral phenotypes associated with resiliency to food-cue (i.e. food advertisement)&#xD;
      induced overeating and determine whether these phenotypes protect children from weight gain&#xD;
      during the critical pre-adolescent period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator's central hypothesis is that children who are resistant to food-cue induced&#xD;
      overeating will exhibit a distinct cluster of neural, behavioral, and cognitive traits that&#xD;
      protect them from weight gain, even in the context of high-familial obesity risk. Identifying&#xD;
      these traits is critical to the development of successful, individually tailored obesity&#xD;
      prevention programs. This hypothesis is informed by compelling preliminary research showing&#xD;
      that children who are less susceptible to food-cue induced eating in the laboratory show&#xD;
      decreased neural activation in somatosensory (i.e., post-central gyrus) and reward (i.e.,&#xD;
      striatum) regions and increased activation in cognitive control regions (i.e., dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex-dlPFC) following food commercial exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results provide a strong foundation for characterizing neural responses that are&#xD;
      associated with resiliency to food-cue induced eating, but highlight major gaps in the&#xD;
      literature that must be addressed to advance the field. This proposal will make three novel&#xD;
      contributions to the understanding of the etiology of obesity. Using a prospective,&#xD;
      family-risk design, the investigators will follow 100, 7-9 year-old children who have healthy&#xD;
      weight but vary by risk for obesity (based on maternal weight status) for 1 year to&#xD;
      characterize neural and behavioral responses to food commercials and identify common neural&#xD;
      networks associated with resiliency to food-cue induced overconsumption. Second, the&#xD;
      investigators will use sophisticated behavioral coding to characterize children's eating&#xD;
      following food commercial exposure at both homeostatic (i.e., meal consumed when hungry) and&#xD;
      non-homeostatic (i.e., eating in the absence of hunger - EAH snack buffet) events and relate&#xD;
      individual differences in eating behavior to neural phenotypes. Finally, the investigators&#xD;
      will follow children over 1 year to determine whether the neural and behavioral responses at&#xD;
      baseline are protective against adiposity gains, during a critical period where children are&#xD;
      cognizant of the purpose of advertising, but cannot fully defend against its effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data will be collected over 4 weekly initial visits, followed by a 5th visit one&#xD;
      year later.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Flanker is a measure of executive function, specifically tapping inhibitory control and attention. Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time. A 2-vector scoring method is employed that uses accuracy and reaction time, where each of these &quot;vectors&quot; ranges in value between 0 and 5, and the computed score, combining each vector score, ranges in value from 0-10. For any given individual, accuracy is considered first. If accuracy levels for the participant are less than or equal to 80%, the final &quot;total&quot; computed score is equal to the accuracy score. If accuracy levels for the participant reach more than 80%, the reaction time score and accuracy score are combined. Higher scores indicate higher levels of ability to attend to relevant stimuli and inhibit attention from irrelevant stimuli.</description>

    <measure>Change in scores from the NIH Toolbox: Child Cognitive battery-List Sorting Working memory test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The List Sorting Working memory test assesses working memory. The List Sorting test requires immediate recall and sequencing of different visually and orally presented stimuli (i.e., &quot;working memory&quot;). Pictures of different foods and animals are displayed with accompanying audio recording and written text (e.g., &quot;elephant&quot;), and the participant is asked to say the items back in size order from smallest to largest, first within a single dimension (either animals or foods, called 1-List) and then on two dimensions (foods, then animals, called 2-List). The test takes approximately seven minutes to administer. List Sorting is scored by summing the total number of items correctly recalled and sequenced on 1-List and 2-List, which can range from 0-26.Higher scores on each of these indicate higher levels of working memory within the normative standard being applied.</description>

    <description>The Dimensional Change Card Sort Test is used to measure cognitive flexibility. Two target pictures are presented that vary along two dimensions (e.g., shape and color). Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time. A 2-vector scoring method is employed that uses accuracy and reaction time, scores ranging from 0-10. For any given individual, accuracy is considered first. If accuracy levels for the participant are less than or equal to 80%, the final &quot;total&quot; computed score is equal to the accuracy score. If accuracy levels for the participant reach more than 80%, the reaction time score and accuracy score are combined. Higher scores indicate higher levels of cognitive flexibility.</description>

Participants respond to questions using a 4-point Likert scale. The scale has four subscales; BAS Drive, BAS Fun Seeking, BAS Reward Responsiveness and BIS. Higher values suggest more drive, increased fun seeking, responsiveness to reward, and avoidance of unpleasantness.</description>

Households are classified into food security status categories (1) food secure (fewer than 3 food-insecure responses); (2) low food security (more than 2 but fewer than 8 food-insecure responses among households with children); and (3) very low food security (8 or more food-insecure responses among the 18 questions for households with children) based on the number of food-insecure responses to questions. The scales differ on each question, but higher overall scores correspond with greater food insecurity. Families are said to be food insecure if they fall in categories 2 or 3.</description>

    <description>Parent questionnaire: Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS). The HFIAS consists of two types of related questions. The first question type is called an occurrence question. There are nine occurrence questions that ask whether a specific condition associated with the experience of food insecurity ever occurred during the previous four weeks (30 days). Each severity question is followed by a frequency-of-occurrence question, which asks how often a reported condition occurred during the previous four weeks (1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often). Scoring ranges from 0-27, with higher scores indicating more food insecurity.</description>
