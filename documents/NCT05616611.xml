      Background: The relationship between immobilization and localized osteoporosis is well&#xD;
      documented in chronic stroke patients. Hemiparetic patients are predisposed to fractures and&#xD;
      usual activity impairment due to a considerable loss of bone density. A serious health care&#xD;
      challenge is finding ways to reduce osteoporosis and associated fractures among stroke&#xD;
      survivors. This study aimed to compare the effects of HILT and ESWT in treating osteoporosis&#xD;
      and its consequences in hemiparetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods: A randomized controlled trial was performed at the Faculty of Physical&#xD;
      Therapy Outpatient Clinic, Cairo University. One hundred and twenty hemiplegic patients with&#xD;
      osteoporosis of both sexes were chosen randomly. They were randomly classified into three&#xD;
      equal groups (n=40 in each group). The control group received medication and traditional&#xD;
      physiotherapy programs for stroke patients (strengthening, stretching, and balance exercise).&#xD;
      The high-intensity laser (HIL) group received the same intervention as the control group in&#xD;
      addition to high-intensity laser therapy. The shock wave (SW) group received the same&#xD;
      intervention as the control group in addition to shock wave therapy. The three groups&#xD;
      received an intervention that lasted 3 sessions/week for 12 weeks). All groups were assessed&#xD;
      before and after therapy (3 months) for the degree of pain, which was evaluated by visual&#xD;
      analog scale (VAS), fall risk assessment (overall stability index and Short Form of Berg&#xD;
      Balance Scale (SFBBS)), and Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for&#xD;
      Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO-41).&#xD;
