  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to adapt existing Nourish Program curriculum for synchronous&#xD;
      virtual delivery,to implement adapted virtual Culinary Medicine (CM)curriculum among target&#xD;
      population, to assess if program participation improves participant dietary behaviors,&#xD;
      nutrition knowledge, and cooking skills and behaviors above standard of care, to assess if&#xD;
      program participation improves patient levels of HbA1c, Body Mass Index, Blood Pressure, HDL,&#xD;
      LDL and Triglycerides above standard of care and to determine the feasibility and&#xD;
      reproducibility of virtual synchronous CM classes in patients with diabetes.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, post intervention (upto 10 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>This consists of 7 items that are scored from 1 [Not at all] to 5 [More than once a day] for a maximum score of 35, a higher number indicating better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Shopping, cooking, and eating behaviors by the Nourishing the Community Through Culinary Medicine survey (NCCM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post intervention (upto 10 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>This consists of 9 items that are scored from 1 [Never] to 5 [Always], for a maximum score of 45, with a higher number indicating more ideal shopping, cooking and eating behaviors that align with program goals.</description>

    <measure>Change in Diabetes Management by the Nourishing the Community Through Culinary Medicine survey (NCCM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post intervention (upto 10 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>This consists of 18 items. The first 16 items that are scored from 1 [Does not apply to me] to 4 [Applies to me very much] and the remaining 2 items are dichotomous scored [Yes=1] to [No=0], for a maximum score of 68, with a higher number indicates a better diabetes self-management.</description>

    <measure>Change in cooking self-efficacy by the Nourishing the Community Through Culinary Medicine survey (NCCM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post intervention (upto 10 weeks after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>This consists of 10 items that are scored from 1 [Not sure at all] to 5 [Extremely sure], for a maximum of 50, with a higher number indicating more self-efficacy. Five items ask about self-efficacy before the program, and five ask about self-efficacy after the program.</description>

    <description>The virtual curriculum will include five 90-minute sessions (to be held weekly or bi-weekly). Participants will cook and engage virtually (with video and sound on) from their home kitchens via the digital platform. Participants will also be expected to shop for groceries ahead of the sessions to participate in the program. A gift card will be provided for groceries ($20 per class = $100 total).Asynchronous virtual educational content (cooking skills videos, animated nutrition education videos, and additional recipes) will be provided to engage and retain participants beyond initial sessions. Recipes will provide enough food for a family of four. clinic patients</description>
