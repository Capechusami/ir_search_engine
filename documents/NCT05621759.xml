  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label, phase II clinical trial. Adult patients with hematological&#xD;
      malignancies undergoing allogeneic HSCT from first- or second-degree haploidentical donor are&#xD;
      eligible for the study if they meet the standard criteria defined in our institutional&#xD;
      standard operation procedures (SOPs), meet all inclusion criteria, and do not satisfy any&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. Patients will receive non-myeloablative, reduced-intensity or&#xD;
      myeloablative conditioning regimen followed by peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells.&#xD;
      Patients will receive dosed reduced cyclophosphamide, abatacept, and short-duration&#xD;
      tacrolimus for GvHD prophylaxis.&#xD;

The cytopenia must be unexplained (such as by disease relapse) and unresponsive to cytokines and must last at least 4 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 730</time_frame>

    <description>Participants to receive:&#xD;
Cyclophosphamide 25 mg/kg IV over 1 hour on Day 3 and Day 4 following transplant&#xD;
Abatacept 10 mg/kg IV on Day 5, Day 14, Day 28, and Day 56 following transplant&#xD;
Tacrolimus 0.02 mg/kg IV by continuous infusion, starting on Day 5 following transplant. May switch to oral administration when tolerated, adjusted to maintain a drug level between 5-12ng/mL. Tacrolimus treatment is continued until Day 60 and then tapered over a period of 4 weeks in the absence of GvHD.</description>
