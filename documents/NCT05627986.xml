  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is a common musculoskeletal system complaint, accounting for 7-34% of patients&#xD;
      in the clinic. The most common shoulder problem is subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS). Up&#xD;
      to 45% of individuals with SIS may have unsuccessful treatment and still complain of symptoms&#xD;
      after 2 years. This chronicity of pain may not be fully explained by structural injuries or&#xD;
      damage, but may be related to sensorimotor changes. Decreased corticospinal excitability and&#xD;
      increase inhibition have been found in individuals with SIS. These central motor changes may&#xD;
      link to alteration in pain and nociception processing and the somatosensory system, which has&#xD;
      been found in individuals with low back pain. Hyperalgesia has been found over both affected&#xD;
      and unaffected shoulders in patients with SIS, indicating central and peripheral&#xD;
      sensitization. However, no study has investigated whether there are changes in the central&#xD;
      somatosensory system. Therefore, the objectives of this proposal are (1) to investigate the&#xD;
      corticomotor and somatosensory system in patients with SIS (2) to investigate the&#xD;
      relationship between the corticomotor and somatosensory alterations in patients with SIS.&#xD;
      Subjects with chronic SIS and healthy subjects were recruited, with 32 people in each group.&#xD;
      Electroencephalography (EEG) will be used to collect somatosensory activity, including&#xD;
      somatosensory evoked potentials, spectral analysis of EEG oscillations and event-related&#xD;
      spectral perturbation (ERSP) of the shoulder movement. Electromyography will be used to&#xD;
      record muscle activity. Transcranial magnetic stimulation will be used to test corticomotor&#xD;
      excitability, including active motor threshold, motor evoked potentials, cortical silent&#xD;
      period, and intracortical inhibition and facilitation. The pressure pain threshold will be&#xD;
      collected by a pressure algometer on the muscles of bilateral arms and legs. Pain intensity&#xD;
      will be assessed with the Numeric Rating Scale. Shoulder function will be evaluated with the&#xD;
      Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire. Depression will be evaluated with Center&#xD;
      for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).&#xD;
