  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain in children is usually an undertreated entity. Undertreating perioperative pain could&#xD;
      lead to various metabolic, physiologic, and neurophysiological responses. The usual means of&#xD;
      management i.e., opioids may increase the incidence of respiratory depression in this age&#xD;
      group. Adequate postoperative analgesia in children is a vital part of perioperative care.&#xD;
      Good pain relief minimizes oxygen requirement, reduces cardio-respiratory demands, and&#xD;
      promotes early ambulation and recovery. Regional block given preoperatively in combination&#xD;
      with general anesthesia provides good preemptive analgesia. It is associated with hemodynamic&#xD;
      stability, rapid and complete recovery, and reduced analgesic requirement in postoperative&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of the study: A prospective randomized controlled double-blind study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sample of 86 undergoing cleft lip revision under general anesthesia will be needed. The&#xD;
      sample will be randomly divided into two equal groups: Group-I (n=43) will receive total&#xD;
      volume of 1 ml each side.of bupivacaine (0.2%) and Group II (n=43) will receive total volume&#xD;
      of 1 ml each side.of bupivacaine (0.2%) and 1 µ/kg of clonidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4.4 -Study tools (in detail, e.g., lab methods, instruments, steps, chemicals, …):&#xD;
      Preoperative assessment: The day prior to surgery, all patients will undergo pre-anesthetic&#xD;
      check-up including detailed history, physical, systemic examination, and weight of the&#xD;
      patient. All patients will be investigated for exclusion of any of the above-mentioned&#xD;
      contraindications. Laboratory work needed will include Complete Blood Count (CBC);&#xD;
      Prothrombin Time and Concentration (PT&amp; PC). All children will be kept nil per mouth 6-8 h&#xD;
      for solids and 2 h for clear liquids. No pre-medications will be given for the purpose of the&#xD;
      study. Preparation of the patient: Written consent from parents and emergency resuscitation&#xD;
      equipment including airway devices, pediatric advanced life support drugs will be available.&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients will be randomly allocated into two groups of 43 patients each: Group&#xD;
      C: Children will receive intra-oral infra-orbital nerve block using bupivacaine 0.2% after&#xD;
      induction of general anesthesia and before starting surgical procedure. Total volume of 1 ml&#xD;
      each side. Group B: Children will receive intra-oral infra-orbital nerve block using&#xD;
      bupivacaine 0.2% and clonidine 1 ug/kg after induction of general anesthesia and before&#xD;
      starting surgical procedure. Total volume of 1 ml each side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in this study will be anesthetized by the same team of anesthesiologists and&#xD;
      operated upon by the same surgical team who will be unaware of the study medications. General&#xD;
      anesthesia (GA) will be standardized for all patients in both groups using 100% O2 with fresh&#xD;
      gas flow of 6 L/min and sevoflurane with increments of 1 MAC at each breath up to 8 MAC with&#xD;
      appropriate size face mask. Parents will be allowed to be present and collaborated during&#xD;
      face mask induction and then leave the theater when their children close their eyes.&#xD;
      Intraoperative monitoring will include ECG, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure,&#xD;
      capnography, and temperature. After intravenous access securing, infusion of normal saline&#xD;
      0.9% solution 4 ml/ kg/h starts followed by standard fluid maintenance therapy according to&#xD;
      the patient's weight. Endotracheal intubation (RAE-ETT) with appropriate size to the&#xD;
      patient's age will be performed after administration of 2 mg/kg propofol. After orotracheal&#xD;
      intubation, assisted mechanical ventilation using Ayre's T- piece will be used to maintain&#xD;
      end-tidal carbon dioxide at 35±5 mmHg. GA will be maintained with 2-3 MAC sevoflurane.&#xD;
      Intravenous dexamethasone 0.25 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 8 mg) will be administered as&#xD;
      prophylactic antiemetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For intraoral approach of infraorbital nerve block, the patient will be placed in the supine&#xD;
      position so that the maxillary occlusal plane forms a 45-degree angle with the floor. A&#xD;
      cotton-tipped applicator will be used to apply a topical anesthetic to the oral mucosa of the&#xD;
      gum line above the maxillary canine. The infraorbital foramen can be approximated by having a&#xD;
      patient look straight ahead and imagining a line down from the pupil to the inferior border&#xD;
      of the infraorbital ridge, bicuspid teeth, and mental foramen. The inferior orbital rim will&#xD;
      be found with the index and middle fingers of the non-injecting hand. Once it is located, the&#xD;
      palpating finger will remain in place to prevent losing landmarks and stop the needle from&#xD;
      entering the orbit. The cheek will be retracted with the thumb of the non-injecting hand and&#xD;
      then the needle will be into the mucosa above the upper second bicuspid approximately 0.5 cm&#xD;
      from the buccal surface. The needle should be directed superiority and remain parallel to the&#xD;
      second bicuspid until it is palpated near the foramen. Before injecting the anesthetic, it is&#xD;
      important to aspirate to ensure the needle is not within a vessel. The anesthetic will be&#xD;
      injected into the space. It is important to avoid injecting the anesthetic into the foramen&#xD;
      by keeping firm pressure on the inferior orbital rim with the palpating finger. Immediate&#xD;
      complications related to regional anesthesia will be recorded: &gt; Systemic toxicity related to&#xD;
      local anesthetics (seizures, heart rhythm, or conduction disorder) &gt; Bleeding at puncture&#xD;
      site &gt; Pupil alteration and ocular lesion Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate&#xD;
      (HR), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), and temperature will be recorded before induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia. After endotracheal intubation, MAP, HR, SpO2, end-tidal CO2, and temperature will&#xD;
      be measured 5 minutes and every 15 minutes until full recovery from the general anesthesia&#xD;
      then every 15 min in the PACU for 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin incision will be made 20 minutes after infra-orbital block. An increase in HR and MAP&#xD;
      above 20% of baseline values with skin incision will be considered as a sign of inadequate&#xD;
      analgesia. In this case, fentanyl 1 µg/kg will be given intravenously, and the case will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the end of surgery, IV paracetamol 15 mg/kg will be administered. After completion of&#xD;
      the surgical procedure, sevoflurane administration will be discontinued, and the fresh gas&#xD;
      flow will be increased to 8 L/min with 100% oxygen. The patient will be extubated after&#xD;
      ensuring adequate orogastric suction and patients will be transferred directly to the post&#xD;
      anesthesia care unit (PACU) where parents are allowed to stay with their children in a quiet&#xD;
      and warm environment without any stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of analgesia will be assessed in the PACU immediately postoperatively and then at&#xD;
      4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 hours using FLACC pain scale. The scale has five criteria that are&#xD;
      each assigned a score of 0, 1, or 2. The scale is scored in a range of 0-10, with 0&#xD;
      representing no pain while 10 is the worst pain. The results of FLACC scale were interpreted&#xD;
      as follows: 0 = Relaxed and Comfortable; 1-3 = Mild discomfort; 4-6 = Moderate pain; 7-10 =&#xD;
      Severe pain or discomfort or both. For postoperative pain control paracetamol intravenous&#xD;
      infusion 15 mg/kg will be given if the recorded FLACC pain score is 4 or more. Pain scores&#xD;
      will be recorded every 10 minutes after administration of rescue analgesia to evaluate pain&#xD;
      relief or need for further rescue analgesia. The number of children who will need&#xD;
      postoperative rescue analgesics and the duration of analgesia that will be taken at the time&#xD;
      when an analgesic is required will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative vomiting episodes will be recorded and treated with intravenous ondansetron 0.1&#xD;
      mg/kg. Postoperative sedation will be assessed using sedation score (1. Awake and alert. 2.&#xD;
      Sleeping but easily arouses to voice or light touch. 3. Arouses to loud voice or shaking. 4.&#xD;
      Arouses with painful stimuli only. 5. Unarousable). Delayed complications of the blocks will&#xD;
      be also investigated and recorded as hematoma, restricted mouth opening, vision, sensory or&#xD;
      motor deficit, eating disorder, and local infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will be asked to evaluate their satisfaction regarding pain control at the end of 24&#xD;
      h postoperatively through 5point Likert scale (1 = very satisfied, 2 = satisfied, 3 = neither&#xD;
      satisfied nor dissatisfied, 4 = dissatisfied, 5 = very dissatisfied). Patients will be&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital when they are pain free and there is no other medical reason to&#xD;
      admit them to a surgical ward.&#xD;
