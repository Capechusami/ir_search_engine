  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to develop and test an individual decision aid for pre-exposure&#xD;
      prophylaxis (PrEP) tailored to Black women who have been exposed to intimate partner violence&#xD;
      and are working with a domestic violence service provider. three different ways of delivering&#xD;
      the tailored decision aid are being tested: 1) as an individual tool; or 2) as a shared&#xD;
      decision-making tool with a domestic violence advocate; as compared to generalized&#xD;
      information. The goal of decision aid will be to address key cultural and structural factors&#xD;
      affecting these women and can help them gain PrEP awareness and access.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence (IPV)-exposed Black women are often forced to choose between&#xD;
      relationship safety and HIV prevention; thus, trauma-, gender-, culturally-responsive HIV&#xD;
      prevention interventions are needed for this key priority population. Pre-exposure&#xD;
      prophylaxis (PrEP) may be a viable partner-independent option for IPV-exposed Black women,&#xD;
      but no study has identified an evidence-based strategy to promote and increase PrEP uptake&#xD;
      among this population, specifically IPV-exposed Black women in the South. Guided by the&#xD;
      Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), the proposed research aims to&#xD;
      adapt, implement and evaluate self- and advocate-administered versions of a PrEP decision aid&#xD;
      in a domestic violence agency in Baltimore in order to increase PrEP uptake among Black women&#xD;
      in Ending the HIV Epidemic (EtHE) priority areas, address trauma as a barrier to PrEP uptake,&#xD;
      and ultimately combat racial disparities in women's HIV cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this Type II hybrid effectiveness-implementation study seeks to adapt an existing&#xD;
      PrEP decision aid to IPV-exposed Black women seeking domestic violence (DV) services in&#xD;
      Baltimore, an EtHE priority state. Self- and advocate-administered versions of the PrEP&#xD;
      decision aid will be implemented and the aid will be evaluated using a three-arm randomized&#xD;
      trial. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) will guide this&#xD;
      research. A formative evaluation using qualitative interviews with IPV-exposed Black women&#xD;
      (N=10) and DV advocates (N=20) was conducted to adapt the PrEP decision aid. Next, the&#xD;
      decision aid will be implemented in a DV agency and 90 IPV-exposed Black women will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the self- or advocate-administered versions of the aid, or the control&#xD;
      intervention, in order to compare feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness&#xD;
      with baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6-month surveys. Focus groups with DV advocates and participants&#xD;
      will assess for implementation process outcomes. This study will: provide support for a PrEP&#xD;
      decision aid that addresses HIV prevention for IPV-exposed Black women; use implementation&#xD;
      science to increase PrEP uptake; include DV agencies in intervention development and&#xD;
      implementation; and improve understanding of PrEP scale-up by addressing implementation&#xD;
      factors in settings that serve IPV-exposed Black women.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in HIV Risk Perception</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post intervention, up to 2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>8-item Perceived Risk of HIV scale repeated at the beginning and end of engagement with the decision aid, with responses measured on a 5- point Likert scale, which has been shown to be more robust than a single-item screening question for HIV risk perception. Specifically, responders will specify their level of agreement to the question in five points: (1) Strongly disagree; (2) Disagree; (3) Neither agree nor disagree; (4) Agree; (5) Strongly agree.</description>

    <description>Single item screening question: &quot;How interested are you in starting PrEP now?&quot; repeated at the beginning and end of engagement with the decision aid, with responses measured on a 5- point Likert scale, with responders specify their level of agreement to the question in five points: (1) Strongly disagree; (2) Disagree; (3) Neither agree nor disagree; (4) Agree; (5) Strongly agree.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 1, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Validated measure of decision uncertainty and perceived effective decision making (i.e. about starting PrEP), specifically the healthcare consumers' decision uncertainty, the factors contributing to the uncertainty, and health-care consumers' perceived effective decision making. Utilizes a 5-point Likert scale where responders specify their level of agreement to the questions in five points: (1) Strongly disagree; (2) Disagree; (3) Neither agree nor disagree; (4) Agree; (5) Strongly agree.</description>

    <description>A qualitative measure of: 1) feasibility of implementing the decision aid; 2) barriers and facilitators to decision aid implementation; 3) experiences conducting the decision aid or perceptions of women's experiences using decision aid; and 4) fidelity to implementation. Data collected through focus group meeting transcripts and analyzed using computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software.</description>
