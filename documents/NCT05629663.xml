  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is important to provide practice-oriented education for nurses in a safe environment. As&#xD;
      it became difficult to maintain face-to-face education and practice environment due to&#xD;
      COVID-19, a new paradigm for nurse education was required. The investigators tried to use&#xD;
      augmented reality technology in nurse education, and based on this, research was conducted to&#xD;
      devise, develop, apply, and evaluate the satisfaction and usability of educators. The field&#xD;
      needs were checked through literature review, the subject of the augmented technology-based&#xD;
      education program was selected, and the program was produced and applied, and this was&#xD;
      evaluated through a questionnaire including a system usability evaluation scale and a&#xD;
      technology acceptance model-based question.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As patient-centered nursing education is considered more important, the amount of nursing&#xD;
      education required is also increasing. In addition, the safety of the educational environment&#xD;
      is important for nurses' application education to various clinical environments. In the past,&#xD;
      simulation education, which generally expects learning effects through practice and&#xD;
      motivation, was mainly conducted. However, in the COVID-19 situation, it has become difficult&#xD;
      for educators and educators to gather in one space to conduct clinical education.[4] Based on&#xD;
      the need for alternatives to this, The investigators devised a nurse education program using&#xD;
      various new technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, virtual training systems are being developed in various application fields thanks&#xD;
      to the development of augmented reality and virtual reality. In particular, medical training&#xD;
      and clinical application have become important since the recent international epidemic of&#xD;
      COVID-19. The strength of new technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR) has enabled various&#xD;
      programs for education and healthcare that have overcome the limitations of time and space.&#xD;
      Augmented reality is already being applied to self-directed learning in various areas, which&#xD;
      provides learners with a highly immersive learning environment so that medical personnel can&#xD;
      receive more accurate and precise medical education in the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators tried to develop an augmented reality technology-based program that can&#xD;
      provide training to nurses using the Headmount display device, and to find out the evaluation&#xD;
      that reaches usability and satisfaction after applying it to educators.&#xD;
