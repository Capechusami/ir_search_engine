      Study Title: Role of rhPSMA-7.3 PET/CT imaging in men with High-Risk prostate cancer&#xD;
      following conventional imaging and associated changes in medical management Protocol number:&#xD;
      BED-IIT-437 Phase: 3b Sponsor: MidLantic Urology Funding Organization: Blue Earth Diagnostics&#xD;
      Ltd Study Design: This is a Phase 3b, multi-center, single-arm, diagnostic imaging study&#xD;
      designed to detect metastatic lesions in men diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer.&#xD;

      Consented patients will be screened to determine eligibility for the study prior to&#xD;
      investigational product (IP) administration. In addition to their routine clinical work-up,&#xD;
      which will include 99mtechnetium-biphosphonate bone scan and abdominal/pelvic computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and chest CT per local practice, and&#xD;
      before the scheduled radical prostatectomy (RP) and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND), or&#xD;
      radical pelvic radiation therapy, patients will receive 8 mCi (296 MBq) ± 20% rhPSMA-7.3,&#xD;
      delivered as an intravenous (IV) bolus injection, followed by PET imaging. For each patient,&#xD;
      the PET imaging results will be reported to the responsible physician prior to the planned&#xD;
      treatment. Imaging results and further procedures/treatment plan should be discussed with the&#xD;
      patient within 7 days after rhPSMA-7.3 imaging (this may be conducted by telephone at the&#xD;
      clinician's discretion). Within 45 days post-IP administration, the patient will receive&#xD;
      treatment as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard of care surgical treatment of PCa, including PLND; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the rhPSMA-7.3 PET scan detects M1 lesion(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A biopsy/surgery and/or additional imaging to confirm M1 lesion(s) will be required&#xD;
                prior to initiation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of rhPSMA-7.3 PET/CT with conventional&#xD;
      imaging for detecting metastatic disease in men with high-risk prostate cancer and the impact&#xD;
      on medical management of these men. Accurate staging of newly diagnosed PCa assists in&#xD;
      directing appropriate treatment strategies. In patients with high-risk PCa, the primary goal&#xD;
      of imaging is to detect extra-prostatic disease. The identification of metastatic disease may&#xD;
      significantly change the planned treatment regimen from locoregional to systemic therapy&#xD;
