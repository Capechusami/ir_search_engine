  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anatomical ophthalmological connections and their dynamics are still debated in the&#xD;
      scientific community. However, their considering is essential in many surgeries (strabismus,&#xD;
      cataract, refractive...) or in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlation between these biometric values would make it possible to refine the knowledge&#xD;
      related to these landmarks and thus offer better ophthalmological management by integrating&#xD;
      these variables into the clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to analyze the correlation between the angle lambda and the ocular&#xD;
      dominance depth in healthy individuals without ophthalmologic disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, seconds goals were defined as the study of the relation between the value of the angle&#xD;
      lambda and the fixation disparity quantified with the Rousseau test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relation between ocular dominance measured with the Guillon's test and the Hole-in-car test&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The angle lambda corresponds to the angle formed by the pupillary axis (line passing through&#xD;
      the center of the pupil and perpendicular to the cornea) and the line of sight (broken line&#xD;
      between the fixation point and the fovea and passing through the center of the pupil&#xD;
      entrance). The angle kappa corresponds to the angle between the visual axis (line between the&#xD;
      point of fixation and the fovea: area of the retina allowing precise vision) and the&#xD;
      pupillary axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The angle lambda and the angle kappa are very close, which is why the lambda angle is often&#xD;
      equated with the kappa angle, both in practice and in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature reports a non-null angle kappa ranged between 1.91° ± 0.14° and 5.73° ± 0.10°&#xD;
      in the general population. Also, studies have reported a significantly greater angle on the&#xD;
      left eye compared to the right eye. Moreover - because of the interpupillary difference -&#xD;
      each eye perceives the same image from a different angle, resulting in a fixation disparity,&#xD;
      defined as the angle of the residual deviation of the visual axes when the subject fixes and&#xD;
      binocularly merges an image. In some cases, too high a value of the disparity can lead to a&#xD;
      fixation disorder requiring orthoptic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anatomical ophthalmological connections and their dynamics are still debated in the&#xD;
      scientific community. However, their considering is essential in many surgeries (strabismus,&#xD;
      cataract, refractive...) or in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlation between these biometric values would make it possible to refine the knowledge&#xD;
      related to these landmarks and thus offer better ophthalmological management by integrating&#xD;
      these variables into the clinical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to analyze the correlation between the angle lambda and the ocular&#xD;
      dominance depth and the fixation disparity in a healthy population without ophthalmologic&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, seconds goals were defined as the study of the relation between the value of the angle&#xD;
      lambda and the fixation disparity quantified with the Rousseau test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relation between ocular dominance measured with the Guillon's test and the Hole-in-car test&#xD;
