  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to compare in resectable liver metastases colorectal&#xD;
      cancer patients.The main question it aims to answer is to investigate whether the&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) of resectable colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) patients&#xD;
      with positive ctDNA after surgery is superior with the combination of adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      and maintenance therapy compared to adjuvant chemotherapy alone.&#xD;

    <description>he complications of adjuvant therapy usually refer to the adverse events that occur during or after treatment, including but not limited to chemotherapy-related adverse reactions, radiation therapy-related adverse reactions, and postoperative complications. Specifically, chemotherapy-related adverse reactions may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anemia, and infections; radiation therapy-related adverse reactions may include skin inflammation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and dry mouth; postoperative complications may include bleeding, infection, intestinal obstruction, and poor wound healing. Researchers typically record the types, severity, and impact of these complications on treatment to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adjuvant therapy.</description>
