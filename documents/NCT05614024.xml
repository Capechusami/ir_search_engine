  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of noninvasive prefrontal cortex (PFC)&#xD;
      neurofeedback during eating in women with bulimia nervosa (BN) using a wearable brain imaging&#xD;
      device, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The investigators will examine how&#xD;
      this training may influence inhibitory control and BN symptoms.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of PFC neurofeedback during eating in&#xD;
      women with bulimia nervosa (BN) using fNIRS. Specifically, the study aims 1) to demonstrate&#xD;
      ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC) neurofeedback target engagement in women with BN using fNIRS; and&#xD;
      2) to link changes in PFC activation to changes in inhibitory control and eating-related&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from women with BN who will be randomly assigned to one of two group&#xD;
      conditions (real or sham-control neurofeedback during eating). Participation includes a phone&#xD;
      screening assessment, psychodiagnostic assessment, one in-person evaluation, one&#xD;
      neurofeedback session, behavioral tasks, online questionnaires before and after the&#xD;
      neurofeedback session, and a remote follow-up assessment.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a go/no-go task 1 week before and 1 week after the neurofeedback session to measure inhibitory control.&#xD;
Participants behavioral performance on the go/no-go task will be determined by the percentage of incorrect responses made as they are prompted to react to different pictorial stimuli. Participants' percentages of error can range from 0% to 100%. A higher percentage indicates a lower behavioral performance on the task.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the experimental arm will see their true, real-time brain activation (i.e., active real-time neurofeedback) during the neurofeedback session. This activation will be displayed to the participant as a thermometer that will increase as brain activation in the target region increases.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the sham-control arm will see false feedback (or a fake signal) that is not connected to their right vlPFC activation during the neurofeedback session.</description>

          -  Ongoing medical treatment, major medical condition, or psychiatric disorder that may&#xD;
             interfere with study variables or participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current psychotherapy focused primarily on eating disorder symptoms&#xD;

    <gender>Female</gender>
    <gender_based>Yes</gender_based>
    <gender_description>The prevalence of bulimia nervosa is substantially greater in women than in men. Moreover, prior research suggest that men and women show different neural response patterns during the engagement of inhibitory control, and that satiety differentially impacts the neural function of males and females.</gender_description>
