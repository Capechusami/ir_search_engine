  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T-cell lymphoma/leukemia is a group of highly lethal diseases with a high relapse rate and&#xD;
      poor prognosis. CD7 was proved to be widely expressed in T-cell malignant, which makes it a&#xD;
      promising therapeutic target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we aim to test the safety and efficacy of CD7 CAR-T cells in T-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma/leukemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      T-cell lymphoma accounts for 10%~15% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in China. According to the World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO), T-cell lymphoma was divided into the following subtypes: T-cell,&#xD;
      NK cell lymphoma/leukemia. There were two major categories: anterior T-cell tumors and&#xD;
      posterior thymic T-cell lymphomas, which originate from lymph nodes, extranodal tissue, or&#xD;
      skin; mature or peripheral T-cell lymphomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally speaking, the relapse accounts for 50-60% after first-line treatment, while the&#xD;
      remission rate with second-line treatment was extremely low. Collectively, there was an&#xD;
      urgent need for new treatment modalities to improve the clinical outcomes of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD7 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays an important role in T-cell and T-cell/B-cell&#xD;
      interactions during early lymphoid development. The expression of CD7 persist from stem to&#xD;
      mature T cells. CD7 was proved to be widely expressed in T-cell malignant, which makes it a&#xD;
      promising therapeutic target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we aim to testify the safy and efficacy of CD7 CAR-T cells in T-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma/leukemia.&#xD;
