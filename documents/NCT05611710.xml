      as compared to placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;

      hyperinflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety of anakinra therapy in dengue with hyperinflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of anakinra therapy in patients with dengue on physiological,&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double blinded placebo controlled trial investigating the effects of&#xD;
      four days of anakinra treatment on dengue patients with hyperinflammatory syndrome. The&#xD;
      anakinra/placebo will be given to eligible participants admitted to the Hospital for Tropical&#xD;
      Diseases (HTD) in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 160 dengue patients will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either anakinra or placebo intervention group to receive treatment for 4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to the HTD with a clinical diagnosis of dengue and at least 1 warning&#xD;
      sign(s) or severe dengue to Emergency department / inpatient wards / Intensive Care Units&#xD;
      (ICU), will be invited to participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two phases of consent. Firstly, the eligible patients will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the screening phase during which, the collection of clinical information about&#xD;
      this acute illness episode as well as some screening tests will be performed, including&#xD;
      measurement ferritin, creatinine, pregnancy test (for all females).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If ferritin level is greater than 2000ng/mL and meet all other inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
           criteria, patients will be invited to participate in the randomization phase (second&#xD;
           consent), which they will be randomly given either anakinra or placebo intravenous (IV)&#xD;
           for four days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If ferritin level is between 1000 and 2000ng/mL, their ferritin level measurement will&#xD;
           be repeated daily for up to three days. If after three days, ferritin level exceeds&#xD;
           2000ng/mL, patients will be invited to participate in the randomization as describes&#xD;
           above. However, if their ferritin level remains below 2000ng/mL after three days of&#xD;
           screening, they will be excluded from this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If ferritin level is less than 1000ng/mL, patients will be excluded from the trial. All&#xD;
           procedures will be stopped and patients will not take any study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be conducted in two phases. In the initial phase (cohort 1), ten adults&#xD;
      (≥16 years) will be enrolled and be provided with anakinra 200mg bid via IV route for 4 days.&#xD;
      A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) review will take place after day 5 data is fully available&#xD;
      for the first ten patients enrolled in cohort 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the safety and clinical data of cohort 1 show no safety concerns, the study will progress&#xD;
      to the second phase (cohort 2), which will include 150 patients (adults and children), who&#xD;
      will be given a weight-based dose of IV anakinra:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (i) 200mg bid for four days in adults participants (≥ 16 years) or in children (12-16&#xD;
           years), with weight &gt; 50kg; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (ii) 2mg/kg bid for four days in children (12-16 years), with weight &lt; 50Kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up daily at the clinical wards until discharge. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected daily for 5 days, for:- (i) full blood cell counts; (ii) biochemistry tests&#xD;
      (creatinine, transaminases, albumin, bilirubin, ferritin, CRP,…); (iii) measuring the&#xD;
      kinetics of viremia; (iv) analyzing the host genetic factors using the RNA extraction&#xD;
      samples; and (v) investigating the immune responses. Ultrasound scans will be performed on&#xD;
      alternate day to assess vascular leakage. After discharge, all patients will be asked to come&#xD;
      back for a final FU visit at around day 30 of illness (25 days-35 days) and also at 3 months.&#xD;
      Patients' quality of life will be explored using the EQ-5D questionnaire score at hospital&#xD;
      discharge and day 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of all AEs and SAEs will be recorded on specific forms, together with an assessment&#xD;
      as to whether the events are likely to have been related to any treatment received. All SAEs&#xD;
      will be reported promptly to the DMC and ECs according to policy. In cases of discontinuation&#xD;
      due to AEs, participants will be followed up until the events have resolved or stabilized.&#xD;
