  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery via sternotomy is performed on more than one million people annually. Patient&#xD;
      education may promote engagement in daily activities postoperatively. It is unknown if there&#xD;
      is any difference in patients' feedback and outcomes when the education is delivered&#xD;
      individually or in a group format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to collect participants' feedback and therapists' time spent on&#xD;
      individual- and group-based Education in Daily Activities Engagement - Post-Sternotomy.&#xD;

      This single-site non-randomised controlled study was conducted at Liverpool Hospital, NSW,&#xD;
      Australia. All patients aged 18 or above who had received cardiac surgery via sternotomy at&#xD;
      Liverpool Hospital cardiothoracic ward were consecutively allocated to the individual- or&#xD;
      group-based postoperative education. Outcomes included a survey to obtain participants'&#xD;
      feedback, the time spent by therapists delivering the education per participant, and&#xD;
      participants' length of postoperative hospital stay.&#xD;
