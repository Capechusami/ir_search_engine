      This study intends to use the relevant case data of COVID-19 in Hubei Province, using big&#xD;
      data processing and mining methods to evaluate the effects of clinical indicators, drug use&#xD;
      and genes on the clinical prognosis of COVID-19 patients, so as to provide a theoretical&#xD;
      basis for the treatment of these diseases and reduce the mortality.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hubei Province, as the forefront of the fight against epidemic, has the largest number of&#xD;
      patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the highest quality medical data. However, so far,&#xD;
      these data have not been fully analyzed, if these data can not be mined and used, it will be&#xD;
      a great loss to the whole human race. By fully mining and analyzing these data, we can sum up&#xD;
      a large number of experiences related to COVID-19, summarize various laws of this kind of&#xD;
      disease, and provide clinical evidence based on large samples for the research of this&#xD;
      disease, eventually contribute China's experience to the global fight against the epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above background, this study intends to use the relevant case data of COVID-19&#xD;
      in Hubei Province, using big data processing and mining methods to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      clinical indicators, drug use and genes on the clinical prognosis of COVID-19 patients, so as&#xD;
      to provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of these diseases and reduce the mortality.&#xD;

        This study is a hospital-based observational study initiated by Tongji Hospital, Tongji&#xD;
        Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Trained researchers are&#xD;
        responsible for screening and joining the group. About 6,8000 COVID-19 patients in Hubei&#xD;
        Province were expected to be included in this study. Patients enrolled in the group will&#xD;
        undergo baseline survey and follow-up according to the program.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age â‰¥ 18, regardless of gender;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A history of epidemiology, including travel or residence in high-risk areas or other&#xD;
             communities with case reports within 14 days before the onset of the disease, or have&#xD;
             a history of contact with novel coronavirus infection (those who are positive for&#xD;
             nucleic acid tests); or patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the community&#xD;
             with case reports; or aggregative onset;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Corresponding clinical manifestations, including respiratory symptoms such as fever,&#xD;
             with typical imaging features of COVID-19, normal or decreased white blood cell count&#xD;
             and decreased lymphocyte count in the early stage of the disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clear etiological evidence, including real-time fluorescent RT-PCR detection of novel&#xD;
             coronavirus nucleic acid positive, or viral gene sequencing, is highly homologous to&#xD;
             novel coronavirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who meet any of the following criteria cannot be enrolled in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients refused to participate in this study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. According to the researchers, patients are unable to complete this study or comply&#xD;
             with the requirements of this study (due to management or other reasons).&#xD;
