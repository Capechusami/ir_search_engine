    <textblock>
      A choledochal cyst (CDC) is a congenital anomaly of the biliary system, which is more common&#xD;
      in the Asian population. If a CDC is not diagnosed and treated promptly, it often leads to a&#xD;
      series of serious complications, including cholangitis, cyst rupture, cholestatic cirrhosis,&#xD;
      and even cholangiocarcinoma. Infants with a postnatal diagnosis of CDC often present with&#xD;
      symptoms, and to avoid the occurrence of serious complications, operative correction should&#xD;
      be performed as soon as possible when their clinical conditions allow. However, in the&#xD;
      current era with the improvement of prenatal screening technology, an increasing number of&#xD;
      choledochal cysts are diagnosed prenatally in the fetus. In developed countries, as many as&#xD;
      15% of choledochal cysts are found before birth. Some of these children receive intervention&#xD;
      when they are asymptomatic at an early stage, while some have progressed to CDC-related&#xD;
      symptoms before operative correction. The timing of operation for children with a prenatal&#xD;
      diagnosis of CDC remains controversial. The investigators previous study showed that it is&#xD;
      more advantageous to receive surgical treatment in the asymptomatic period for patients with&#xD;
      prenatally diagnosed CDC. In addition, the age at operation (months) appears to be unrelated&#xD;
      to intraoperative and postoperative complications, which is distinct from previous studies.&#xD;
      More interestingly, the investigators found that a specific cyst size (length &gt; 5.2 cm and&#xD;
      width &gt; 4.1 cm) suggested that clinical symptoms might appear and that the surgery should be&#xD;
      performed as soon as clinically safe to proceed. Therefore, in this study, the investigators&#xD;
      tried to select the operation time according to the cyst size and evaluate the treatment&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
