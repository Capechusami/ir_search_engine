  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this natural history study is to examine the immune responses to the Heplisav-B&#xD;
      vaccine in Veterans living with HIV who were non-responders to prior HBV vaccination. A&#xD;
      comparison group of HBV vaccine nonresponders without HIV infection will be enrolled to&#xD;
      characterize the HIV-associated immune alterations that affect vaccine response. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that TLR9-mediated innate immune stimulation with Heplisav will&#xD;
      elicit HBV seroprotection despite prior vaccination failures in persons living with HIV,&#xD;
      compared to HIV uninfected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants eligible for Heplisav-B vaccination will be asked to provide blood samples at&#xD;
      multiple timepoints before and after their vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-positive individuals are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality from Hepatitis B&#xD;
      co-infection, due to shared routes of transmission, increased likelihood of developing&#xD;
      chronic infection (as opposed to spontaneous clearance), and increased immune dysregulation&#xD;
      leading to accelerated disease progression, and so current guidelines recommend the routine&#xD;
      vaccination of HIV-positive individuals against HBV. However, because achieved seroprotection&#xD;
      rates (SPR) are historically lower than in HIV-negative individuals, post-vaccination&#xD;
      serologic testing is recommended for this group and re-vaccination (with increased dose or&#xD;
      additional doses) should be attempted for those who were non-responders to the initial&#xD;
      vaccine. Heplisav-B is a HBV vaccine adjuvanted with a TLR9 agonist that has shown improved&#xD;
      SPR among groups with reduced response rates to classic alum-adjuvanted vaccines, such as&#xD;
      those with CKD, obesity, or diabetes. The investigators propose to evaluate immunological&#xD;
      mechanisms of protection in Veterans who were non-responders to prior HBV vaccination now&#xD;
      receiving Heplisav vaccinations. The investigators will enroll a comparison group of&#xD;
      HIV-negative individuals to characterize the HIV-associated immune alterations that modulate&#xD;
      vaccine response. The investigators hypothesize that TLR9-mediated innate immune stimulation&#xD;
      with Heplisav will elicit HBV seroprotection despite prior vaccination failures in persons&#xD;
      living with HIV, compared to HIV uninfected individuals. By assessing innate immune responses&#xD;
      and B cell immunophenotypes at baseline, post-vaccination, and at long-term followup in&#xD;
      Veterans with and without HIV the investigators will assess the mechanisms by which the&#xD;
      immunostimulatory effects of TLR9 agonists may overcome the immune dysfunction in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

        The target population includes patients (or healthcare providers) who have received prior&#xD;
        Hepatitis B vaccines without achieving seroprotection (defined as a negative SAb&#xD;
        qualitative titer or a SAb quantitative titer &lt;10 mIU/mL collected at least 30 days after&#xD;
        last vaccine dose). The primary enrollment group will include Veterans living with HIV,&#xD;
        with a comparator group of HIV-negative individuals. An additional exploratory population&#xD;
        of HBV vaccine nonresponders who were successfully treated for HCV infection may be&#xD;
        included to provide an opportunity for evaluation of the immune responses in patients who&#xD;
        have been cured of chronic viral infections.&#xD;
