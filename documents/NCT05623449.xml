    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of hypnosis sessions performed in&#xD;
      teleconsultations and led by a nurse, for patients with peripheral chronic neuropathic pain.&#xD;
      Acceptability, satisfaction and effects (on pain and psychological distress) are also&#xD;
      evaluated, comparing patients who have benefited from teleconsultations and those who did&#xD;
      not.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Factors explaining peripheral chronic neuropathic pains are complex ; they require a&#xD;
      personalized therapeutic strategy and multidisciplinary management. Among the recommended&#xD;
      management, psychocorporal approaches such as hypnosis, are subject of recent interest. At&#xD;
      the CHU de Bordeaux, the management of patients suffering from such chronic pains, consists&#xD;
      of 5 hypnosis sessions, conducted face-to-face, each performed one month apart : the first&#xD;
      session is carried out by a doctor and a hypnotherapist nurse and the 4 following sessions by&#xD;
      the hypnotherapist nurse alone. However, it seems that this usual management is not easily&#xD;
      accessible for patients who are geographically distant and/or who are unable to move due to&#xD;
      excessive pain. In such situations, teleconsultations would avoid travel for these patients&#xD;
      with low mobility and then would an interesting alternative to face-to-face consultations.&#xD;
      Few studies have been done on hypnosis sessions led by teleconsultations. So, the whole&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to compare the management of 15 patients by teleconsultations&#xD;
      (experimental arm) with 15 other patients seen in face-to-face (control arm) to evaluate&#xD;
      feasibility of teleconsultation in hypnosis.&#xD;
