  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trichotillomania (TTM) is characterized by hair pulling that is repetitive in nature leading&#xD;
      to notable hair loss, causing clinically significant distress and resulting in impairments&#xD;
      across social and functional domains (APA, 2013). Trichotillomania causes significant social&#xD;
      impairment including affecting close relationships, pursuing occupational changes or&#xD;
      advancement, or interfering with schooling (Grant et al., 2017; Woods, Flessner, Franklin,&#xD;
      Wetterneck, et al., 2006). The core of the treatment of trichotillomania has traditionally&#xD;
      been Habit Reversal Training (HRT) (Twohig, Bluett, et al., 2014). Another form of treatment&#xD;
      that is gaining empirical support is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which has been&#xD;
      studied in four randomized controlled trials, one studying ACT as a standalone treatment&#xD;
      (Lee, Homan, et al., 2018), and three examining ACT combined with HRT (Twohig et al., 2021;&#xD;
      Lee, Haeger, et al., 2018; Woods, Wetterneck, et al., 2006) which demonstrated efficacy of&#xD;
      the combined treatment in decreasing pulling symptom severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of trichotillomania in the US is 1-2% of the population and yet treatment&#xD;
      access is limited by many issues including processionals' lack of knowledge of the disorder&#xD;
      and low treatment accessibility (Walther et al., 2010). ACT- enhanced behavior therapy has&#xD;
      been implemented using telehealth to reach a larger population (42.2% decrease pre-to-post&#xD;
      treatment), but telehealth still requires therapist time and incurs notable costs (Lee,&#xD;
      Haeger, et al., 2018). The present study aims to address the gap in trichotillomania&#xD;
      treatment accessibility by examining the role of check-ins on adherence and efficacy on&#xD;
      afully automated, web-based ACT-enhanced HRT treatment for adults with trichotillomania&#xD;
      across the United States. We predict that the condition with check-ins will increase&#xD;
      adherence and efficacy of the treatment significantly more than the condition without&#xD;
      check-ins. Additionally, we predict that hair pulling severity and psychological flexibility&#xD;
      will be significantly improved by the condition with check-ins compared to the condition&#xD;
      without check-ins.&#xD;

    <measure>Massachusetts General Hospital- Hair Pulling Scale (MGH-HPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MGH-HPS assesses urges to pull, pulling behavior, and the distress caused by pulling through a seven-item self-report measure. Items are rated individually on a scale from 0-4 and then the total scale is summed from 0-28-point total score. Higher scores indicate greater hair pulling severity. Treatment response is indicated by a seven-point reduction in score (Houghton et al., 2015). The MGH-HPS demonstrates good internal consistency (Keuthen et al., 1995), test-retest reliability and convergent and divergent validity (O'Sullivan et al., 1995).</description>
