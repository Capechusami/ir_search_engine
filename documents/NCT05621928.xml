  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine against&#xD;
      covid-19, recommended by the national immunization program. This is a multicentric,&#xD;
      observational, case-control study. Participants Cases with the disease will be compared to&#xD;
      Control Participants, that is, without the disease, regarding the vaccination history for&#xD;
      Covid-19.Complementarily, an evaluation of cellular and humoral immunity will be carried out&#xD;
      in a sample of both case and control participants, taking into account the vaccination&#xD;
      history.&#xD;
