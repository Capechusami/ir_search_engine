      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Healthy, exercising adult&#xD;
      males and females will be recruited for participation. After providing informed consent, each&#xD;
      participant will be randomized to one of three groups: 1) OxyShred thermogenic fat burner; 2)&#xD;
      Placebo (PL); and 3) Control. All participants will complete a baseline laboratory visit&#xD;
      consisting of assessments of body composition, anthropometry, metabolism, hemodynamics,&#xD;
      dietary intake, exercise habits, and subjective variables. Participants in the two&#xD;
      intervention groups (i.e., OxyShred and PL) will then be given dietary supplements for daily&#xD;
      consumption, including OxyShred/PL and protein powder. Participants in all groups will&#xD;
      complete the 4-week study and follow their usual training and nutrition habits - besides&#xD;
      increased protein intake in the OxyShred and PL groups - along with questionnaires to assess&#xD;
      compliance with the study protocol and potential side effects of supplementation. Following&#xD;
      this 4-week period, participants will complete a second laboratory visit, where all baseline&#xD;
      assessments will be repeated. The effects of group (OxyShred, PL, and control) and time&#xD;
      (baseline, 4 weeks) will be statistically examined using linear models, along with&#xD;
      appropriate post-hoc tests.&#xD;

      Overview. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Healthy,&#xD;
      exercising adult males and females will be recruited for participation. After providing&#xD;
      informed consent, each participant will be randomized to one of three groups: 1) OxyShred&#xD;
      thermogenic fat burner; 2) Placebo (PL); and 3) Control. All participants will complete a&#xD;
      baseline laboratory visit consisting of assessments of body composition, anthropometry,&#xD;
      metabolism, hemodynamics, dietary intake, exercise habits, and subjective variables.&#xD;
      Participants in the two intervention groups (i.e., OxyShred and PL) will then be given&#xD;
      dietary supplements for daily consumption, including OxyShred/PL and protein powder.&#xD;
      Participants in all groups will complete the 4-week study and follow their usual training and&#xD;
      nutrition habits - besides increased protein intake in the OxyShred and PL groups - along&#xD;
      with questionnaires to assess compliance with the study protocol and potential side effects&#xD;
      of supplementation. Following this 4-week period, participants will complete a second&#xD;
      laboratory visit, where all baseline assessments will be repeated. The effects of group&#xD;
      (OxyShred, PL, and control) and time (baseline, 4 weeks) will be statistically examined using&#xD;
      linear models, along with appropriate post-hoc tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants. Eligible participants who provide consent will be stratified based on exercise&#xD;
      training (resistance-trained, endurance-trained, or concurrently-trained), sex (male and&#xD;
      female), and body composition (males: 10 to 20% vs. &gt;20%; females: 15 to 25% vs. &gt;25%), then&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the three experimental groups (OxyShred, PL, or control) in a&#xD;
      2:2:1 ratio. Based on preliminary power analysis and comparison with previous studies, the&#xD;
      target sample size is 50 participants (20 Oxyshred, 20 PL, and 10 control), with&#xD;
      approximately equal representation of males and females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Visits. Participants will report to the laboratory at baseline and after 4 weeks&#xD;
      of the assigned intervention. At both laboratory visits, participants will be interviewed to&#xD;
      confirm adherence with pre-testing guidelines, such as fasting overnight and abstaining from&#xD;
      food and fluid ingestion. Participants will then undergo body composition testing using the&#xD;
      methods listed below. Anthropometric variables, such as waist circumference and wasit:hip&#xD;
      ratio, will be collected via 3-dimensional optical scanning. Resting energy expenditure and&#xD;
      substrate oxidation (respiratory quotient) will be assessed using indirect calorimetry, and&#xD;
      resting heart rate and blood pressure will be quantified using an automated blood pressure&#xD;
      monitor. Questionnaires will be used to assess physical activity levels, sleep, mood, and&#xD;
      hunger related variables. The specific body composition assessment methods to be used are ADP&#xD;
      (air displacement plethysmography), DXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), several&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance techniques, several 3-dimensional scanning techniques, ultrasound,&#xD;
      and standard assessments of height and weight. All equipment will be calibrated as&#xD;
      recommended by the device manufacturers each day prior to use. Metabolism will be assessed&#xD;
      using indirect calorimetry. For the on-site surveys, the following questionnaires/surveys&#xD;
      will be used: Demographics, Exercise Habits, and Caffeine Questionnaire; the International&#xD;
      Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ); the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; the Mood and&#xD;
      Feelings Questionnaire; the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (R18); ASA24; and menstrual&#xD;
      cycle questionnaire for female participants. For the daily online compliance surveys, one of&#xD;
      two forms will be used, depending on the group assignment of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. Participants randomized to the control group will be asked to continue their&#xD;
      normal exercise and nutrition habits without making any modification for the duration of the&#xD;
      study. However, as an incentive and to promote equity between conditions, control group&#xD;
      participants will receive the protein supplement provided to the other groups after&#xD;
      completion of the study. Participants in the OxyShred and PL group will be provided their&#xD;
      assigned supplement (OxyShred or PL powder) along with supplemental protein, all provided by&#xD;
      EHP labs. Oxyshred is a commercially available product, and the placebo will include the same&#xD;
      flavoring agents and ingredients but without the active ingredients. The protein product is&#xD;
      also commercially available. Participants will be asked to consume one dose of the&#xD;
      OxyShred/PL supplement for the first week, either upon waking or 15 minutes prior to&#xD;
      exercise, as indicated on product directions. After the first week, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to consume two doses per day, one upon waking and one 15 minutes prior to exercise,&#xD;
      which is also according to product directions. On days exercise is not performed,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to consume one dose upon waking and a second dose in the early&#xD;
      afternoon. Protein supplements will be provided to support body composition improvements.&#xD;
      Participants with a baseline body mass between 50 and 59.9 kg will be asked to consume one&#xD;
      serving (providing ~25 g protein) per day; participants with a baseline body mass between 60&#xD;
      and 89.9 kg will be asked to consume two servings per day (providing ~50 g protein); and&#xD;
      participants with a baseline body mass between 90 and 110 kg will be asked to consume three&#xD;
      servings per day (providing ~75 g protein). Besides the OxyShred/PL and protein&#xD;
      supplementation, participants in the OxyShred and PL groups will be asked to generally&#xD;
      continue their normal nutritional practices, including the types of foods they eat and eating&#xD;
      frequency. However, all participants will be asked to refrain from consuming additional&#xD;
      sports supplements and weight loss supplements throughout the trial. Consumption of general&#xD;
      health support supplements, such as multivitamins, will be allowed if they were regularly&#xD;
      consumed prior to study commencement (typically for â‰¥1 month). Daily caffeine intake, beyond&#xD;
      that provided by the supplements, will be limited to ~100 mg per day, and participants will&#xD;
      be provided with information about quantities of common foods or beverages providing this&#xD;
      amount (e.g., one cup of coffee, two diet sodas, etc.). Throughout the intervention,&#xD;
      compliance and potential side effects will be monitored via questionnaire. All participants&#xD;
      will be asked to continue their typical exercise regimen and complete questionnaires&#xD;
      documenting their frequency, duration, and type of exercise sessions.&#xD;
