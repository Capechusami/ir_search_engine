  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) and pancreatic (pancreatic adenocarcinoma (ADKP);&#xD;
      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (TNEP)) primary tumors are the most common malignant tumors&#xD;
      of the hepato-bilio-pancreatic system and represent a major public health issue. At present,&#xD;
      the management of these tumors is based on recommendations based on the existence of&#xD;
      rudimentary prognostic and theranostics markers that do not sufficiently accurately reflect&#xD;
      the heterogeneity of tumor biology. It therefore seems essential to identify new and more&#xD;
      relevant markers in order to optimize the care of these patients in daily practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic reprogramming is now recognized as an essential feature of cancer cells, allowing&#xD;
      them to fuel and maintain their proliferation and tumor growth. Such metabolic reprogramming&#xD;
      requires modification of several energy pathways, the most commonly recognized being the&#xD;
      transition from energy metabolism based on oxidative phosphorylation to energy metabolism&#xD;
      based on glycolysis, even under aerobic conditions (Warburg effect). In this context, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that the consumption of nutrients by the tumor cell differs&#xD;
      significantly from that of the normal cell in order to support its increased energy needs,&#xD;
      and that this important and specific metabolic reprogramming would be correlated with the&#xD;
      histo-prognostic and theranostics factors of these tumors. Preliminary analyses on surgical&#xD;
      resection parts conducted by the various partners in 2019 made it possible to characterize&#xD;
      the metabolic signatures of a series of HCC and ADKP resected using the Metafora biosystems&#xD;
      technology platform. These signatures reflect a metabolic program characteristic of these&#xD;
      tumors, which reveal strong specificities. Similarly, a candidate signature correlating with&#xD;
      the presence of vascular microscopic invasion has been identified in HCC, and the level of&#xD;
      activation of glycolysis and glutaminolysis by certain ADKP cells also appears as a trait of&#xD;
      interest vis-à-vis the aggressiveness of this cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the current project will aim to confirm the feasibility of identifying specific&#xD;
      prognostic and theranostics metabolic signatures early, on biopsy samples and / or&#xD;
      circulating blood cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary liver tumours (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) and pancreatic tumours (pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma (ADKP); pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs)) are the most frequent&#xD;
      malignant tumours of the hepatobiliopancreatic system and represent a major public health&#xD;
      issue. One of the main lines of research for these tumors consists in the early&#xD;
      identification of prognostic and theranostic factors to adapt the management of patients as&#xD;
      closely as possible to the specificities of their pathology. This identification is currently&#xD;
      sorely lacking in daily clinical practice. Thus, unlike what is done for other types of&#xD;
      neoplastic pathologies such as breast cancer, the management of primary liver and pancreatic&#xD;
      tumors is still often based on recommendations based on the existence of rudimentary&#xD;
      prognostic and theranostic markers that do not reflect sufficiently faithfully the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of tumor biology. It is therefore essential to identify new, more relevant&#xD;
      markers in order to optimize the management of these patients in daily practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic reprogramming is now recognized as an essential characteristic of cancer cells,&#xD;
      allowing them to fuel and maintain their proliferation and tumor growth. Such metabolic&#xD;
      reprogramming requires modification of several energy pathways, the most commonly recognized&#xD;
      being the shift from energy metabolism based on oxidative phosphorylation to energy&#xD;
      metabolism based on glycolysis, even under aerobic conditions (Warburg effect). Other&#xD;
      metabolic pathways such as increased glutaminolysis have recently been identified. In this&#xD;
      context, we hypothesized that the consumption of nutrients by the tumor cell differs&#xD;
      significantly from that of the normal cell in order to support its increased energy needs,&#xD;
      and that this important and specific metabolic reprogramming would be correlated with the&#xD;
      histo-prognostic and theranostic factors of these tumors. Within ADKPs, 2 molecular subtypes&#xD;
      have been described: a very aggressive, &quot;basal-like&quot; subtype with increased glycolytic&#xD;
      metabolism and metastatic properties and a &quot;classical&quot; subtype, better differentiated with&#xD;
      better prognosis. The identification of these subtypes is currently only possible by RNA-seq,&#xD;
      a technology not practiced routinely. Similarly, metabolism appears to define a subgroup of&#xD;
      aggressive NETs. Indeed, NETs with high glucose uptake, visible on 18FDG PET-CT scan, have a&#xD;
      worse prognosis. This type of examination also showed that there was spatial metabolic&#xD;
      heterogeneity (primary tumor vs. metastasis) and temporal metabolic heterogeneity in these&#xD;
      tumors and that the latter was correlated with prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary analyses conducted by the various partners in 2019 made it possible to&#xD;
      characterize the metabolic signatures of a series of resected HCC and ADKP using Metafora&#xD;
      biosystems' technological platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These signatures reflect a metabolic program characteristic of these tumors, which reveal&#xD;
      strong specificities. Similarly, a candidate signature correlating with the presence of&#xD;
      microscopic vascular invasion has been identified in HCC, and the level of activation of&#xD;
      glycolysis and glutaminolysis by some ADKP cells also appears as a trait of interest&#xD;
      vis-à-vis the aggressiveness of this cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As these results were obtained on surgical resection parts, the current project will&#xD;
      therefore aim to confirm the feasibility of identifying specific prognostic and theranostic&#xD;
      metabolic signatures early, on biopsy sampling or circulating blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multicenter study includes 300 patients (100 patients for each tumor type) and aims to&#xD;
      identify a prognostic metabolic signature from tumor tissue samples of HCC, ADKP and&#xD;
      pancreatic NETs.&#xD;
