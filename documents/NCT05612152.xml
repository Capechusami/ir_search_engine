    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a tobacco treatment navigator to&#xD;
      improve primary care patient engagement in tobacco cessation support. We compare an ask,&#xD;
      advise and connect to the quitline approach vs. the novel tobacco treatment navigator&#xD;
      approach on the primary outcomes of receipt of tobacco cessation counseling sessions and&#xD;
      receipt of tobacco cessation medications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Our novel intervention, Choose2Quit, builds on our prior successes with the Ask, Advice,&#xD;
      Connect study, but now 1) allows personalized choice of counseling modality (phone, text,&#xD;
      web, in-person); 2) conveys the value and low/no-cost availability of medications to support&#xD;
      quit attempt success and sends providers the patient's request in e-prescription to transmit&#xD;
      to patient's pharmacy; 3) assesses patient's need to manage social barriers to quitting by&#xD;
      linking them to Unite-US; and 4) uses an initial phone contact from a recognizable local&#xD;
      number, will increase the engagement of patients in cessation treatment and in tobacco&#xD;
      cessation. This study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test the effect of a traditional eReferral vs. a Choose2Quit personalized guidance and&#xD;
           choice approach on the ability to contact patients, and the proportion of patients that&#xD;
           initiate tobacco cessation treatment, use tobacco cessation medications and make quit&#xD;
           attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the impact of each intervention arm on equitable engagement in tobacco cessation&#xD;
           treatment, medication use and quit outcomes across gender, race and age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate intervention experience from the patient perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the cost to implement, and per engagement in each of the intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is accomplished using a 2-arm randomized trial. Randomization into the traditional&#xD;
      eReferral vs. Choose2Quit intervention arms will occur at the patient level with a 1:1 group&#xD;
      assignment. Individuals that are ready to quit in the next 30 days and are interested in&#xD;
      being connected with tobacco cessation resources will be randomized. Randomization of&#xD;
      eligible patients occurs automatically with an electronic health record algorithm that routes&#xD;
      the eReferral to the Quitline (traditional eReferral) or the Choose2Quit intervention. The&#xD;
      Ask-Advise-Connect process is exactly the same for medical assistants; medical assistants and&#xD;
      patients are blind to group assignment&#xD;
