  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess the safety and measure image-based absorbed dose of&#xD;
      177Lu-PSMA-EB-01, a new PSMA-specific radiopharmaceutical, in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who will undergo radioligand therapy (RLT). All&#xD;
      patients underwent 68Ga-PSMA and 18F-FDG PET/CT for selection and were randomly divided into&#xD;
      three groups of 3 people each.The three groups received an approximately 1.11 GBq (30mCi),&#xD;
      1.85 GBq (50 mCi) and 2.59 GBq (70mCi) of 177Lu-PSMA-EB-01 up to 2 cycles, respectively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most frequent malignant tumor in men worldwide. Prostate-specific&#xD;
      membrane antigen (PSMA), is a surface molecule specifically expressed by prostate tumors&#xD;
      which was shown to be a valid target for radiotherapy. 177Lu-PSMA-617, a urea-based compound,&#xD;
      provide an effective target for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate&#xD;
      cancer. However, a major problem in the therapeutic use of 177Lu-PSMA-617 has been its short&#xD;
      half-life and fast rate of clearance. The investigators designed and synthesized a new&#xD;
      radiopharmaceutical, named 177Lu-PSMA-EB-01. EB（Evans Blue）can bind to albumin to slow down&#xD;
      its plasma clearance rate, thereby increasing tumor accumulation and reducing the total&#xD;
      dosage of Lu-177. Hence, EB-PSMA-01 may be an option for consideration due to limited supply&#xD;
      of Lu-177, by which more patients may be benefited by this version of 177Lu-EB-PSMA-01. This&#xD;
      study was designed to investigate the safety, dosimetry and preliminary effects of&#xD;
      177Lu-EB-PSMA-01 in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.&#xD;

    <description>The serum PSA response was documented semimonthly until 6 weeks after the administration of 177Lu-PSMA-EB-01. PSA response was classified as the following: partial response (PR) if PSA decrease ≥50%, progressive disease (PD) if PSA increase ≥ 25% and stable disease (SD) if PSA increase &lt;25% or PSA decrease &lt;50%.</description>
