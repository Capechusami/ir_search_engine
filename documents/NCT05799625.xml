      Prospective, randomized, single-blinded, blinded-endpoint trial to determine the impact of a&#xD;
      smartphone application-based program to motivate smokers to increase readiness to quit, make&#xD;
      quit attempts, and quit smoking. The intervention has been designed based by a team of&#xD;
      scientist, taking principles of change behaviour into consideration. The application&#xD;
      incorporates daily reminders, gamification, and models of habit formation to engage users. It&#xD;
      will support participants to reflect on their smoking in a holistic manner through questions&#xD;
      and activities.&#xD;

    <description>Eligible smokers randomized to usual care will receive an educational brochure for the University of Ottawa Heart Institute's Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation (OMSC) Community Program.

    <description>Eligible smokers randomized to the intervention group will be asked to download the StepOne smartphone application onto their smartphone via the Apple Store or Google Play Store. They will be provided with a unique ID and unique code, which will enable them to log into the StepOne smartphone application to begin the 14-day program. Users will interact with the application in the morning and evening; the exact time of the engagement is selected by the participant and ideally at a time that maximizes the likelihood of engaging with the activity. The application incorporates interactive educational material, daily reminders, gamification, and models of habit formation to engage users. As with any other smartphone application, users can turn off notifications if they choose to do so. New content and activities will be shared daily.</description>

    <intervention_name>StepOne Smartphone Application</intervention_name>
    <description>This smartphone application provides a 14-day program that delivers the core components of smoking cessation (i.e., counseling, education) and takes advantage of pandemic-accelerated acceptance of virtual care, videoconferencing, remote monitoring, and social networking. The program seeks to move participants from the pre-action stage (not interested in quitting) to the action stage (intention to quit) and incorporates daily reminders, gamification, and models of habit formation to engage users.</description>
