    <textblock>
      In this study, tunneled PICC was compared with conventional PICC. Eligible subjects were&#xD;
      randomly enrolled into the test group or control group by randomization (1:1), and observed&#xD;
      and evaluated the occurrence of complications during and 7 ± 3 days, 30 ± 7 days, 60 ± 10&#xD;
      days, 90 ± 10 days, 120 ± 10 days (if any) after surgery and extubation at the end of&#xD;
      treatment. To evaluate the clinical effect of tunneled PICC by comparing the rate of&#xD;
      complications of the two groups of patients&#xD;
