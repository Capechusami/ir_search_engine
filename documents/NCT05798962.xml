      The overall purpose of this proposed study is the understanding of cellular mechanisms&#xD;
      involved in the pathologic fatty degeneration of muscle. Fatty infiltration in skeletal&#xD;
      muscle is observed following sports injuries such as muscle strain injuries and Achilles&#xD;
      tendon rupture. It is also observed in the degenerative state after rotator cuff tears as&#xD;
      well as in the aging process. While fatty degeneration of skeletal muscle occurs in many&#xD;
      different conditions and is known to decrease muscle function, the cellular processes&#xD;
      involved in fatty infiltration have not been investigated in human muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There is a high amount of fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) with an adipogenic pattern&#xD;
           in pathologic skeletal muscle following a muscle strain injury and a full Achilles&#xD;
           tendon rupture. We hypothesize that there is an increased number of FAPs with an&#xD;
           adipogenic signature already in the acute phase after a strain injury, but a&#xD;
           significantly higher number in the chronic stage as well as in the muscle following an&#xD;
           Achilles tendon rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mechanical cues are a major driver of the phenotypic drift of FAPs. The lack of&#xD;
           mechanical stimuli initiates the adoption of an adipogenic pathway in naïve FAPs,&#xD;
           whereas naïve FAPs exposed to mechanical stimuli will maintain their undifferentiated&#xD;
           phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The adherence of FAPs to a soft material will activate the adoption of an adipogenic&#xD;
           phenotype, whereas a stiff material will favor a more fibrotic phenotype in naïve FAP's&#xD;
           isolated from healthy skeletal muscle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle strain injury is one of the most common sports injuries, which is caused by&#xD;
      excessive tensile strain of the muscle and affects the region where muscle fascicles insert&#xD;
      into the connective tissue (aponeurosis). It is therefore not an injury solely affecting&#xD;
      skeletal muscle, but the skeletal muscle-aponeurosis interface. Having sustained one strain&#xD;
      injury increases the risk of re-injury substantially, changes the biomechanics of the&#xD;
      involved muscle and leads to a significantly enlarged aponeurosis. Recently, the&#xD;
      investigators have discovered the accumulation of ectopic fat in the intra-fascicular space&#xD;
      and within myofibrils. The built-up of ectopic fat in skeletal muscle is a degenerative state&#xD;
      and has mostly been described for rotator cuff injuries where it is associated with worse&#xD;
      shoulder functional scores. At the same time, the investigators have observed a high&#xD;
      cellularity in the pathologic muscle-aponeurosis following strain injuries, but it is not&#xD;
      known what cell types these cells are. It seems therefore likely that at least some of the&#xD;
      cells are Fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), which contribute to the fat accumulation in&#xD;
      strain injured muscles and that fat accumulation might be a factor contributing to the high&#xD;
      risk of recurrent injuries, as well as other medical problems such as pain and decreased&#xD;
      function often described long time after a strain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another common injury of the lower leg is the full Achilles tendon rupture. Recent data show&#xD;
      that patients have long-term impairments in the injured leg when compared to the non-injured&#xD;
      side. Also after full Achilles tendon ruptures, fatty degeneration of the muscles in the calf&#xD;
      has been reported and has been linked to poor patient outcome. Recently, the investigators&#xD;
      have observed fatty infiltration of calf muscles in patients following Achilles tendon&#xD;
      rupture, which might lead to a decrease in muscle function and thereby to a poor patient&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the high prevalence of muscle strain injuries, very little is known about the&#xD;
      cellular mechanisms following a strain injury. In addition, the literature on the cellular&#xD;
      composition and alterations following Achilles tendon ruptures is scarce. A decade ago, a&#xD;
      group of cells named fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) have been identified in the&#xD;
      interstitial space of skeletal muscle based on the presence of stem cell antigen 1+, CD34+,&#xD;
      Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor α (PDGFR α)+ . Aside from their supporting activity&#xD;
      in muscle regeneration, FAPs have the potential to adopt an adipogenic or profibrotic&#xD;
      phenotype. Despite the high incidence, it has not been studied whether the traumatic injury&#xD;
      and the subsequent biomechanical changes in the skeletal muscle and associated connective&#xD;
      tissue following strain injuries or Achilles tendon rupture activate FAPs, and how these&#xD;
      cells contribute to the fatty accumulation in the skeletal muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There is a high amount of fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) with an adipogenic pattern&#xD;
           in pathologic skeletal muscle following a muscle strain injury and a full Achilles&#xD;
           tendon rupture. The investigators hypothesize that there is an increased number of FAPs&#xD;
           with an adipogenic signature already in the acute phase after a strain injury, but a&#xD;
           significantly higher number in the chronic stage as well as in the muscle following an&#xD;
           Achilles tendon rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mechanical cues are a major driver of the phenotypic drift of FAPs. The lack of&#xD;
           mechanical stimuli initiates the adoption of an adipogenic pathway in naïve FAPs,&#xD;
           whereas naïve FAPs exposed to mechanical stimuli will maintain their undifferentiated&#xD;
           phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The adherence of FAPs to a soft material will activate the adoption of an adipogenic&#xD;
           phenotype, whereas a stiff material will favor a more fibrotic phenotype in naïve FAP's&#xD;
           isolated from healthy skeletal muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this, the investigators will take small tissue samples from the injured area in&#xD;
      either the acute phase (subject group A) or the chronic phase (subject group B) after a&#xD;
      strain injury as well as from the muscle tissue of individuals who had a full Achilles tendon&#xD;
      rupture at least a year prior to inclusion (subject group C). In all three groups, the&#xD;
      investigators will also take a small tissue sample from the same muscle as the injured one on&#xD;
      the healthy side. In addition, a larger muscle biopsy from the contralateral healthy vastus&#xD;
      lateralis muscle is taken to compare the cellular composition and the cellular profile&#xD;
      between the pathologic skeletal muscle-aponeurosis and a healthy skeletal muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the importance of mechanical stimuli, isolated muscle cells will be sorted with&#xD;
      Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) and cultured in vitro thereafter. The&#xD;
      investigators particularly focus on culture under static and dynamic tension and in the&#xD;
      de-tensioned state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alpha level of 0.05 will be considered significant. Based on previous data, 10&#xD;
      participants will be recruited for each group, enabling the investigators to detect an&#xD;
      estimated doubling of FAPs in the injured muscles (primary outcome). Power analysis for the&#xD;
      primary outcome resulted in n=4 for each group (α=0.05, β=0.80, CV=72.4%), which the&#xD;
      investigators consider to be clinically relevant. The investigators plan to include 10&#xD;
      participants in each group to have sufficient biopsy material from 5 individuals for single&#xD;
      nuclei RNA sequencing and 5 biopsies for fluorescence-activated cell sorting and the&#xD;
      subsequent in vitro studies.&#xD;
