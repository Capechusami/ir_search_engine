  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to explore the effectiveness of physical activity (PA) identity&#xD;
      formation in the family system as a promotor of long-term PA. The primary research question&#xD;
      is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does a family identity formation condition (with education+planning) result in increased&#xD;
      child moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA) compared to a standard comparison education&#xD;
      and planning condition at six months? Hypothesis: Child MVPA will be higher for the identity&#xD;
      formation condition in comparison to the more standard PA education+planning condition at six&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

      The secondary research questions will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does the identity formation condition improve child health-related fitness outcomes&#xD;
           compared to the education and planning condition at six months? Hypothesis: Child&#xD;
           health-related fitness will be higher for the identity formation condition in comparison&#xD;
           to the education and planning condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can group differences among behavioural, and health-related fitness outcomes be&#xD;
           explained through a mediation model? Hypothesis: The covariance of the assigned&#xD;
           conditions (identity formation, planning + education) on child MVPA will be explained by&#xD;
           parental support, and through parental support identity (i.e., manipulation check). In&#xD;
           turn, the covariance between support and health-related outcomes will be explained by&#xD;
           MVPA among conditions. In the case of null outcomes for research question #1, the&#xD;
           investigators will instead explore a prediction model of these variables rather than a&#xD;
           mediation model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is there an intergenerational, seasonal, or sex difference across primary outcomes by&#xD;
           assigned condition? Hypothesis: Parents in the identity formation condition will show&#xD;
           higher physical activity via some activities being performed with their children (as&#xD;
           part of social identity) in comparison to the other condition. No differences in child&#xD;
           sex or season are hypothesized based on past research.&#xD;

    <description>Accelerometer model has a Bluetooth proximity detection feature that can determine the presence (e.g., same room in a house, at the park together) or absence of close proximity between two accelerometers. The outcome variable will be average minutes per day parents and children were both engaging in physical activity at the same time while in close proximity.</description>

    <description>This group will receive sessions and information-based booklet and series of worksheets that provide a tangible knowledge translation product for the family. The material will consist of Canada's PA guidelines recommending 60 minutes of MVPA a day and a breakdown of ways for the parent to help their child achieve this PA, outlining three main domains of parental support (encouragement, logistical support, and PA together). The material also contains information about the benefits of PA for the child and how to plan for family PA. The material specifically includes a brainstorming exercise for parents where they list physical activities they think their children have found fun in the past. The investigators will provide this material as prompts/suggestions. This list helps create the template for PA planning by contextualizing what the parents would like to do with their kids. An additional two sessions will include education and planning material related to family healthy eating.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>This group will receive the same content as the education+planning comparison condition but with two additional coaching sessions. The session will include short overviews of the benefits of PA as a family, brainstorming how a family can each assist each other in PA, and an activity for developing a family PA action plan. Behavior change techniques that align with these approaches and are included in the coaching session include identity salience, identity similarity, as well as identity fit and contrast. This will be supplemented by an organization of fun family PA roles for all members (e.g., activity planner, goal setter, supporter, etc.) to instill involvement as well as items (creation of a family PA t-shirt, family PA photos and display, etc.) to instill distinctiveness, which is a central feature of a social identity.</description>
