  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II study. Patients who meet eligibility criteria will receive&#xD;
      therapy as depicted in the schema in the protocol. All patients will receive 3 cycles of the&#xD;
      treatment of nab-paclitaxel (Days 1, 8 and 15), gemcitabine (Days 1, 8 and 15), and TTFields&#xD;
      (worn every day for at least 18 hours). Following the initial 3 cycles of&#xD;
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel/TTFields treatment, patients will undergo restaging by CT or MRI.&#xD;
      Patients with stable disease or better will undergo surgery for resection within 8 weeks&#xD;
      following completion of initial chemotherapy although enrolling sites are encouraged to&#xD;
      perform resection within 4 weeks of Cycle 3 D15 of therapy. If resection yields R0 or R1,&#xD;
      patients will begin an additional 3 cycles of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel/TTFields treatment&#xD;
      within 8 weeks of surgery. Based on available literature, it is expected that a percentage of&#xD;
      patients will not undergo resection either due to disease progression or due to toxicities/&#xD;
      complications of the neoadjuvant segment of therapy. These patients will be included in the&#xD;
      evaluable patients for both co-primary endpoints as well as the secondary endpoints including&#xD;
      ORR, adverse events, and OS.&#xD;
