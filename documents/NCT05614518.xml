  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial was to assess the diagnostic performance and safety of Sodium&#xD;
      Fluoride F-18 Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (18F-NaF-PET/CT) in bone&#xD;
      metastases of malignant tumors compared with Technetium[99mTc] Methylenediphosphonate Bone&#xD;
      Scintigraphy ± Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (99mTc-MDP-BS±SPECT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrolled subjects were randomly assigned to two sequences A and B at a ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
      Within 7 days, 18F-NaF-PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP-BS±SPECT bone imaging were performed alternately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 18F-NaF-PET/CT and&#xD;
      99mTc-MDP-BS±SPECT were calculated respectively based on the diagnostic data of standard of&#xD;
      truth.&#xD;
