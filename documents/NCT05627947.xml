  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pterygium is a disease associated with proliferation of the fibrovascular tissues of the&#xD;
      conjunctiva into the cornea and is related to factors such as ultraviolet light exposure,&#xD;
      chronic stimulation, inflammation, climate, and genetics.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first line of treatment for primary pterygium is surgical excision, and despite&#xD;
      postoperative adjuvant therapy using mitomycin C, cyclosporine, Î²-irradiation, argon laser,&#xD;
      and bevacizumab, recurrence rates remain high .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mitomycin C is a metabolic inhibitor extracted from Streptomyces caespitosus that inhibits&#xD;
      DNA synthesis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant that selectively suppresses T-helper cells, controls&#xD;
      interleukin synthesis and secretion, and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is an anti-VEGF antibody that inhibits angiogenesis. Each agent has been studied&#xD;
      as an adjuvant therapy to inhibit post-surgery pterygium recurrence.&#xD;

    <description>According to the anterior segment slit lamp examination, grade 0 will be defined as no recurrence; grade 1 will be defined as thin episcleral blood vessels, not accompanied by fibrosis, observed around the excised area; grade 2 will be defined as fibrovascular proliferation limited to the sclera in the area will be excised; grade 3 will be defined as fibrovascular proliferation crossing the corneal limbus. Grades 2 and 3 will be defined as recurrence.</description>
