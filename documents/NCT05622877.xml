    <textblock>
      A study on the prediction model of carotid unstable plaque protein and its early&#xD;
      intervention. Protein antibody chip was used to detect the remaining biological samples, and&#xD;
      patients with carotid artery unstable plaque with stroke risk were selected for&#xD;
      interventional clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected patients were randomly divided into 3 groups, which were treated with Zhu's&#xD;
      Wenban Formula (TCM compound granules), Qushi Formula (TCM compound granules) and placebo for&#xD;
      6 months, respectively. The size and number of carotid artery unstable plaques before and&#xD;
      after 6 months were observed, and the occurrence of adverse reactions during the intervention&#xD;
      period was observed.&#xD;
