  <brief_summary>

      The aim of this study was to determine the differences in hemodynamics between different&#xD;
      positions in patients undergoing ultra-early reperfusion therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemodynamic stability can prevent hypoperfusion or hyperperfusion after reperfusion therapy.&#xD;
      It has been reported in a large number of literatures that body position has an effect on&#xD;
      hemodynamics, but the effect of different body positions on the hemodynamics of patients&#xD;
      undergoing ultra-early reperfusion therapy is not clear. In this study, we hypothesized that&#xD;
      the hemodynamics of patients undergoing ultra-early reperfusion therapy would differ between&#xD;
      different positions.&#xD;

    <description>All monitoring was done from 9 to 11 a.m., and the whole monitoring process was carried out in a specific and quiet environment at 20-24℃ to avoid other auditory and visual stimuli. After 10min of the relaxed supine position, the blood pressure, heart rate, and blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery were measured in the 0° position for 5min.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>30 degrees position</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Within 30 seconds after the 0° position measurement completion, the subjects were transferred to the 30° position and rested for 15 minutes under the 30° position. In other words, a washout period of 15 minutes was established between two measurements to ensure the stability of vital signs and avoid confounding effects. The blood pressure, heart rate, and blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery were measured again for 5 minutes after the vital signs were stable.</description>
