      Although DCBs had been widely applicable after registration, there are still lack of clinical&#xD;
      data and evidence in the real world condition of Chinese population. This data collection&#xD;
      aims to perform regularly clinical follow up to guide the standardized diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of patients post-operatively, in order to achieve the maximum clinical benefits of&#xD;
      these patients, as well as improve the development of the field of peripheral artery disease&#xD;
      treated by drug-coated balloon.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historically, symptomatic PAD was treated with surgical bypass; however endovascular&#xD;
      treatment is now the first line treatment when medical therapy fails. Several endovascular&#xD;
      treatment options exist including percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), stenting with&#xD;
      bare metal or drug-eluting stents (DES), cutting balloons, atherectomy, laser debulking.&#xD;
      Moreover, drug-coated balloon（DCB）has emerged as a potential treatment option, combining&#xD;
      acute restoration of vessel patency by balloon dilatation with long term maintenance of such&#xD;
      patency by the anti-proliferative drug delivered by the balloon surface. Results from&#xD;
      numerous clinical studies with paclitaxel coated balloons have been reported for the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy for peripheral artery diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides Medtronic IN.PACT Admiral, other DCBs approved for marketing in Chinese Mainland&#xD;
      include Acoart (Acotec, China), Reewarm ® PTX (endovastec, China), Ultrafree (ZYLOX, China).&#xD;
      Although DCBs had been widely applicable after registration, there are still lack of clinical&#xD;
      data and evidence in the real world condition of Chinese population. Therefore, the data&#xD;
      collection can also further expand and understand the experience of using DCB in a real world&#xD;
      patient population in China, especially for the surveillance of safety events, in order to&#xD;
      ensure the long-term application safety in Chinese population. Moreover, this data collection&#xD;
      aims to perform regularly clinical follow up to guide the standardized diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of patients post-operatively, in order to achieve the maximum clinical benefits of&#xD;
      these patients, as well as improve the development of the field of peripheral artery disease&#xD;
      treated by drug-coated balloon.&#xD;
