  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that the use of spa therapy in Saint-Lary Soulan for knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      treatment would have a therapeutic effect on this pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this external comparison study is to evaluate the comparative&#xD;
      effectiveness at 6 months of spa therapy in the Saint-Lary Soulan spa center on functional&#xD;
      disability and pain (MCII: Minimal Clinical Important Improvement) in knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      compared to the control group of the Thermarthrose multicenter randomized clinical trial,&#xD;
      receiving standard cares.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in the Larytherm cohort will undergo a three-week spa therapy in&#xD;
      Saint-Lary Soulan with a follow-up of 6 months after the end of spa therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is a frequent disease with important consequences for quality of life of&#xD;
      patients. In France, prevalence was estimated at 7.6% among subjects between 40-75 years old.&#xD;
      The management of knee osteoarthritis is essentially based on lifestyle and dietary measures&#xD;
      and the use of analgesic treatment. Spa treatments are also part of the overall management of&#xD;
      this pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the spa town Saint-Lary Soulan requests the approval of the &quot; Rheumatology &quot;&#xD;
      therapeutic orientation for its new borehole water (SL5), which requires a study (Larytherm)&#xD;
      conducted according to the criteria of the French Academy of Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate 6 months after spa therapy in Saint-Lary Soulan, the&#xD;
      evolution of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body Mass Index (BMI),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  knee pain due to knee osteoarthritis,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  functional impact,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  fatigue,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical activity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quality of life,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  consumption of analgesic treatments,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the occurrence of episodes of joint effusion requiring puncture/infiltration,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the occurrence of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be identified by local physicians or through a local public communication&#xD;
      campaign. The patients with criteria of eligibility will complete a self-reported&#xD;
      questionnaire before the beginning of spa therapy, after the spa therapy and 6 months after&#xD;
      the end of spa therapy, and the physicians practising at the spa center will complete a&#xD;
      medical questionnaire at inclusion and after the spa therapy.&#xD;
