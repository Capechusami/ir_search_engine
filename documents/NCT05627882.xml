      This study will be a prospective, tandem-designed study to determine the proportion of&#xD;
      clinically significant missed lesions when using a side- or oblique-viewing endoscope as&#xD;
      compared to the standard forward-viewing endoscope. Utilizing standard endoscopy protocols in&#xD;
      current practice at Brigham and Women's Hospital, consecutive adult patients undergoing ERCP&#xD;
      for traditional reasons will undergo back-to-back tandem EGD and ERCP examinations. This&#xD;
      process entails an EGD performed by an attending gastroenterologist first. Next, a second&#xD;
      blinded attending gastroenterologist will perform ERCP immediately after index EGD. Both&#xD;
      endoscopists will note any clinically significant findings, independent of the other&#xD;
      providers procedural findings. Clinically significant findings defined as endoscopic findings&#xD;
      that alter patient management (i.e., esophageal varices, peptic ulcer disease, hemorrhage,&#xD;
      mass, etc.) during EGD and ERCP will be recorded. As previously stated, some institutions&#xD;
      already routinely perform EGD with every ERCP.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the current procedure of&#xD;
      choice for the treatment for a variety of biliary and pancreatic disorders with over 500,000&#xD;
      procedures performed annually in the United States. While the duodenoscope has a unique&#xD;
      side-viewing design in order to provide optimal visualization of the major papilla during the&#xD;
      ERCP procedure, the non-forward field of view severely limits a complete endoscopic&#xD;
      examination of the esophagus and stomach. As a result, key upper gastrointestinal findings,&#xD;
      such as peptic ulcer disease or hemorrhage, may be missed given the non-forward viewing&#xD;
      design. In a previous retrospective study, significant gastrointestinal findings were not&#xD;
      visualized during ERCP with a side-viewing duodenoscope among 19.2% of patients. Given the&#xD;
      high miss rate associated with ERCP, performing an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with a&#xD;
      forward-viewing endoscope may increase the yield of upper gastrointestinal lesions and&#xD;
      improve overall patient care. Some centers already routinely employ simultaneous EGD/ERCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study is to determine the miss rate&#xD;
      associated with traditional ERCP. This will be done by supplementing a forward-viewing EGD&#xD;
      exam to the traditional side-viewing ERCP procedure. Additionally, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      identify patient characteristics associated with clinically significant findings with&#xD;
      simultaneous EGD/ERCP. The investigators hypothesize that simultaneous EGD during ERCP will&#xD;
      discover clinically significant findings missed by ERCP alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: This study will be a prospective, tandem-designed study to determine the&#xD;
      proportion of clinically significant missed lesions when using a side- or oblique-viewing&#xD;
      endoscope as compared to the standard forward-viewing endoscope. Utilizing standard endoscopy&#xD;
      protocols in current practice at Brigham and Women's Hospital, consecutive adult patients&#xD;
      undergoing ERCP for traditional reasons will undergo back-to-back tandem EGD and ERCP&#xD;
      examinations. This process entails an EGD performed by an attending gastroenterologist first.&#xD;
      Next, a second blinded attending gastroenterologist will perform ERCP immediately after index&#xD;
      EGD. Both endoscopists will note any clinically significant findings, independent of the&#xD;
      other providers procedural findings. Clinically significant findings defined as endoscopic&#xD;
      findings that alter patient management (i.e., esophageal varices, peptic ulcer disease,&#xD;
      hemorrhage, mass, etc.) during EGD and ERCP will be recorded. As previously stated, some&#xD;
      institutions already routinely perform EGD with every ERCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PARTICIPANT SELECTION: Study participants will be selected from the current list of&#xD;
      patients undergoing conventional ERCP at Brigham and Women's Hospital. All patients must have&#xD;
      a standard indication for the ERCP procedure (i.e., benign or malignant biliary obstruction,&#xD;
      choledocholithiasis, etc.) and undergo ERCP with general anesthesia using a conventional&#xD;
      duodenoscope to complete the ERCP procedure. Patients undergoing more than one procedure will&#xD;
      be eligible to be included in this study for each ERCP procedure. Patients will be recruited&#xD;
      from multiple sources including outpatient and inpatient settings or referred from&#xD;
      gastrointestinal, oncologic, or primary care providers. Upon arrival, patients will be&#xD;
      approached about the study by the advanced endoscopy fellow, study coordinator, attending&#xD;
      physician, or member of the gastrointestinal team. Once identified and consented, patients&#xD;
      will undergo initial EGD (with a conventional EGD scope) followed by tandem ERCP as described&#xD;
      above. To ensure adequate enrollment, a power calculation was performed. Assuming a 19% miss&#xD;
      rate1 and 80% power, 144 patients will be required to detect a significant risk difference.&#xD;
      To then assess for clinically significant predictors of positive findings, enrollment is&#xD;
      estimated to include approximately 500 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: For the two comparison groups (EGD findings versus ERCP findings),&#xD;
      continuous data will be compared using the two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test and&#xD;
      categorical data to be compared using the Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate.&#xD;
      Multivariable analyses will also be performed using logistic regression to determine&#xD;
      significant predictors of missed findings (i.e., patient characteristics) and will be&#xD;
      reported as standardized Î² coefficients as well as odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical significance will be defined as a two-tailed P value&#xD;
      &lt;0.05. Statistical analyses will be performed using the Stata 15.0 software package (Stata&#xD;
      Corp LP, College Station, TX).&#xD;
