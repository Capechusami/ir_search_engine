  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exhibitionism is a paraphilia, which is defined according to the DSM 5. The estimated&#xD;
      prevalence in men is between 2 to 4% (The prevalence of exhibitionistic disorder in females&#xD;
      is even more uncertain but is generally believed to be much lower than in males).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At judiciary level: approximately 30% of apprehended male sex offenders are exhibitionists.&#xD;
      They have the highest recidivism rate of any sex offender; about 20-50% are arrested again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies are old and not very prolific on the subject of exhibition. The available data&#xD;
      are lacking, there is no clinical evaluation scale for exhibitionism. The diagnosis is&#xD;
      essentially based on facts with judicial characteristics &quot;did patient show himself? &quot;, &quot;Does&#xD;
      he enjoy showing off?&quot;. Investigators have no data on the cognitive distortions that support&#xD;
      this particular acting out, the (specific) triggering factors and the potential psychological&#xD;
      vulnerabilities of exhibitionists Some cognitive and sensory mechanisms may be involved in&#xD;
      the origin and development of the processes underlying the act (Johnston and Ward 1996). The&#xD;
      investigators will rely on the identification of anticipatory, relieving and permissive&#xD;
      beliefs as a schema that can explain cognitive processes leading to acting out (Johnston and&#xD;
      Ward, 1996). The goal is to apply this approach to exhibitionism. It should be noted that&#xD;
      this model of thoughts (anticipatory, relieving and permissive) is taken up in the field of&#xD;
      addiction. Exhibition is generally presented in the literature as a possible addictive&#xD;
      disorder (Jon E. et al). The investigators will investigate whether there are specific&#xD;
      factors precipitating exhibitionnism's acting out, other than the general precipitating&#xD;
      factors or the recidivism risk factors known in sexual violence (SONAR, STATIC-99, PCL- R,&#xD;
      SVR-20…). The investigators will also study the psychological vulnerabilies of these&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
