    <textblock>
      The goal of this double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized trial is to determine the&#xD;
      optimal dose of nicotinamide riboside (NR), in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main questions the N-DOSE AD trial aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      What dose of nicotinamide riboside (NR) is required to achieve maximal cerebral nicotinamide&#xD;
      adenine dinucleotide (NAD) increase, measured by 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) or&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolomics)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      What dose of nicotinamide riboside (NR) is required to achieve maximal alteration in the&#xD;
      cerebral metabolism patterns, measured by fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (FDG-PET)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      What dose of nicotinamide riboside (NR) will have optimal effect in the absence of&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to do participate in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar puncture&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging - positron emission tomography (MRI-PET) scannings&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biosampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      They'll be given placebo, 1000 mg NR or escalating doses of NR (1000 mg - 2000 mg - 3000 mg)&#xD;
      over 12 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      N-DOSE AD is a double-blinded placebo-controlled randomized trial aiming to determine the&#xD;
      optimal biological dose (OBD) of nicotinamide riboside (NR), in individuals with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with AD (n = 80) will be recruited starting November 2022. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1:2 to either placebo group (n = 20) or NR 1000mg daily (n = 20) for 12 weeks or&#xD;
      to a dose-escalation group where NR 1000mg daily will be administered week 1-4, NR 2000mg&#xD;
      daily week 5-8 and NR 3000mg daily week 9-12 (n =40). Both the participants and the&#xD;
      investigators will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the Optimal Biological Dose (OBD) for NR, defined as the dose required to&#xD;
      achieve: maximal cerebral NAD increase (measured by 31P-MRS or CSF metabolomics), or maximal&#xD;
      expression alteration (measured by FDG-PET), or maximal proportion of MRS-responders, in the&#xD;
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of NR doses 2000 mg and 3000 mg daily in AD,&#xD;
           measured by the frequency and severity of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if NR improves cognitive dysfunction in AD and determine the dose-response of&#xD;
           this effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if NR improves cognitive dysfunction in AD and determine the dose-response of&#xD;
           this effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether NR-therapy ameliorates proteostasis, by upregulating the expression of&#xD;
           lysosomal and proteasomal pathways, and whether this effect is dose-dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the dose-responsive effects of NR on gene and protein expression in AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether NR-therapy decreases inflammatory markers in a dose-responsive manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether NR-therapy influences histone acetylation status in AD in a&#xD;
           dose-responsive manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether NR-therapy, in any of the tested doses, affects methylation&#xD;
           metabolism. Specifically, whether NR-therapy, in any of the tested doses, leads to&#xD;
           decreased availability of methylation substrates and, as a result, any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Decreased availability of methyl-donors, e.g. S-adenosyl methionine (SAM).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Decreased DNA methylation (globally or at specific sites).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Decreased synthesis of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Aberrant folate and one-carbon metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore the relationship between NR-therapy and the gut microbiome in AD, and whether&#xD;
           this effect is dose-responsive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will attend study visits at Baseline, week 4, week 8 and week 12. The study&#xD;
      visits will consist of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment by physician and study nurse involved in the study including The Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR),&#xD;
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (MoCA), Trail Making Test (TMT), The Lawton Instrumental&#xD;
      Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL), The Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS),&#xD;
      Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the The Neuropsychiatric Inventory&#xD;
      Questionnaire (NPI-Q)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and&#xD;
      fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination and measurement of vital signs. Routine blood tests. Urine sample&#xD;
      collection. Faecal sample collection at Baseline and week 12. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
      collection will be performed at Baseline and week 12.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ADAS-Cog 13 is a psychometric instrument that evaluates memory, attention, reasoning, language, concentration, planning, executive function, and praxis using an 13-point AD Assessment Scale. It has a minimum score of 0 and a maximum severity score of 85, and a higher score indicates more impairment. A reduction in between-visit scores indicates an improvement in cognitive functions.</description>

    <measure>The between-visit chang in Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum of boxes (CDR-SB)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR integrates assessments from 3 domains of cognition (memory, orientation, judgment/problem-solving) and 3 domains of function (community affairs, home/hobbies, personal care). Following caregiver interview and systematic participant examination, the rater assigns a score describing the participant's current performance level in each of these domains of life functioning. The &quot;Sum of boxes&quot; scoring methodology (CDR-SB) sums the score for each of the 6 domains and provides a value ranging from 0 to 18 with higher scores indicating greater impairment. Positive change from baseline indicates greater impairment.</description>

    <measure>The between-visit change in executive functioning measured by the Trail Making Test (TMT)</measure>

Symptom severity is rated on a 3-point scale with higher scores indicating worse symptoms. Minimum score would be 0 and maximum score would be 36.</description>
