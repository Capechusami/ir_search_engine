    <textblock>
      Compared with cyclophosphamide, the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in the treatment of&#xD;
      active IgG4-related diseases were evaluated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single center, non randomized, controlled, open label clinical&#xD;
      observation study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tropitib versus cyclophosphamide in&#xD;
      inducing remission in IgG4-RD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) Investigators observe the diagnosis and treatment of IgG4-RD patients, and only provide&#xD;
      patients with clinically appropriate diagnosis and treatment proposals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It does not interfere with the choice of treatment plan for patients with the study drug of&#xD;
      tropib or cyclophosphamide. If the patient chooses the hormone combined with tofatib or the&#xD;
      hormone combined with cyclophosphamide as the main treatment drug, and at the same time meets&#xD;
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study, the patient can be included in this&#xD;
      clinical observation study and become a subject. The experimental group was treated with&#xD;
      glucocorticoid combined with tofatib, and the control group was treated with glucocorticoid&#xD;
      combined with cyclophosphamide. It is planned that 20 people in each group will be treated&#xD;
      for 6 months. After the study, the number of subjects in each group shall be at least 20&#xD;
      according to the actual situation. In the final statistical analysis, ensure that the sample&#xD;
      size of the two groups participating in the statistical analysis is controlled at about 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) The primary end point of this study was to compare the remission rate of the two groups&#xD;
      after treatment; The secondary end point was to compare the response rate, recurrence rate&#xD;
      and adverse event rate of the two groups after treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Definition of disease remission: including ① complete remission (CR) (main efficacy index), partial remission (PR), continuous complete remission (CCR) and no change (NC).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response rate at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after treatment (%)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month, 3 months and 6 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as IgG4-RD RI score decrease ≥ 1 point</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease recurrence rate at 3 and 6 months after treatment (%)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 6 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>There are two types of disease recurrence, clinical recurrence and serological recurrence. Clinical recurrence was defined as recurrence of clinical symptoms or deterioration of imaging findings, with or without elevated serum IgG4 levels; Serological relapse was defined as an increase in serum IgG4 level and an increase in IgG4-RD RI score of ≥ 1 point after treatment, without recurrence of clinical symptoms or deterioration of imaging manifestations. The isolated increase of serum IgG4 concentration only constitutes serological recurrence. The date of recurrence is the date of onset of symptoms, or the date of new or deteriorated physical examination, laboratory examination or radiological examination results.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in physician's overall assessment (PGA) from baseline at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month, 3 months and 6 months of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>First, the doctor evaluated the overall situation of IgG4 - RD subjects and marked them at the corresponding position of the straight line in the form of a vertical vertical line &quot;l&quot;. The straight line is a 100mm scale, where the 0 end of the straight line represents very good, and the 100mm end represents very poor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the number of organs involved and IgG4-RD RI scores from the baseline after 6 months of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The IgG4-RD RI value is obtained by superimposing the individual organ/site score of the patient. The score range of each organ/part is 0-3 points, which is defined as follows: 0 point means that the organ/part is not involved or completely relieved; 1: The lesions improved but still existed; 2 points: (after drug withdrawal) there was a new disease or recurrence of the previously involved site, or the disease did not improve after treatment; 3 Divided into (despite treatment) deterioration of lesions or new lesions.&#xD;
*When the disease of an important affected organ is urgent and requires active treatment, the score of the organ shall be doubled.</description>

    <measure>Changes of IgG4 level and related immunological indicators from baseline after 6 months of treatment</measure>
