    <textblock>
      The BEET PAD Trial is a multi-centered double-blind randomized clinical trial designed to&#xD;
      determine whether beetroot juice, compared to placebo, improves six-minute walk distance at&#xD;
      four month follow-up in people with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD).&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that by simultaneously increasing lower extremity perfusion,&#xD;
      gastrocnemius muscle mitochondrial activity, and myofiber health and regeneration, beetroot&#xD;
      juice will significantly improve walking performance in people with PAD. The primary aim is&#xD;
      to determine whether beetroot juice significantly improves six-minute walk distance at&#xD;
      4-month follow-up in people with PAD, compared to placebo. Preliminary evidence suggests that&#xD;
      beetroot juice has both acute and chronic effects on walking performance in PAD. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will measure the combined acute and chronic effect of beetroot juice (i.e. the&#xD;
      maximal effect) on change in 6-minute walk at 4-month follow-up. In secondary aims,&#xD;
      investigators will distinguish between acute and chronic effects of beetroot juice on&#xD;
      six-minute walk and delineate biologic pathways by which beetroot juice improves walking&#xD;
      performance in PAD, by measuring change in gastrocnemius muscle perfusion (MRI arterial spin&#xD;
      labeling) and gastrocnemius muscle health. The trial will assess the durability of beetroot&#xD;
      juice effects on six-minute walk. Nitrate in beetroot juice is metabolized to nitrite and&#xD;
      subsequently to NO, attaining peak nitrite levels 2.5 hours after ingestion. The trial will&#xD;
      determine whether a higher peak or a greater increase in plasma nitrite at 2.5 hours after&#xD;
      beetroot juice consumption at baseline has a greater effect on six-minute walk at 4-month&#xD;
      follow-up, compared to a lower peak or a smaller increase, respectively.&#xD;
