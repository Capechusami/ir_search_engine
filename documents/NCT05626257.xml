  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Xolair® in patients with chronic&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 24-week, prospective, open-label, multi-center, single-arm, observational,&#xD;
      post-marketing surveillance study under routine clinical practice and does not impose a&#xD;
      therapy, visit, or assessment. The study design was approved by the Korean health authority.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is not to answer scientific hypotheses, but to describe the&#xD;
      incidences of all potential adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and&#xD;
      unexpected AEs not listed in the local label information occurring in Korean patients under&#xD;
      routine clinical practice following the approved local label information.&#xD;

    <description>Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) is a validated questionnaire that is used to assess the impact of chronic rhinosinusitis on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). It is a 22 item questionnaire with each item assigned a score ranging from 0 (no problem) to 5 (problem as bad as it can be). The total score may range from 0 (no disease) to 110 (worst disease), lower scores representing better health related quality of life.</description>

    <description>The incidences of AEs by subject characteristics (demographic and other baseline information, Xolair® administration status, concomitant medication and therapy, etc.). The significance of the difference in the incidence of adverse events between categories within each characteristic will be tested using the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in SNOT-22 according to subject characteristics (demographic and other baseline information, Xolair® administration status, concomitant medication and therapy, etc.). The statistical significance of the difference in the change between the groups will be tested by two-sample t-test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, ANOVA, or Kruskal-Wallis test.</description>
