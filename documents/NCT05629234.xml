  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale of the ROSY-T study is to continue to provide study treatment for patients who&#xD;
      have participated in a parent study with osimertinib and who are continuing to derive&#xD;
      clinical benefit from treatment at the end of such studies, as judged by the Investigator.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ROSY-T is an open label, non-randomised, multicentre, international trial for patients who&#xD;
      have completed a parent study using osimertinib and who are deriving clinical benefit from&#xD;
      continued treatment as judged by the Investigator. Patients will be rolled-over from the&#xD;
      parent study and will continue the study, until they meet one of the treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation criteria.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Patient is currently deriving clinical benefit from continued treatment with&#xD;
             osimertinib in an AstraZeneca parent study using osimertinib monotherapy which has met&#xD;
             its endpoints or has otherwise stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients should be using adequate contraceptive measures.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Concurrently enrolled in any other type of medical research judged not to be&#xD;
             scientifically, or medically compatible with this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Permanent discontinuation from the parent study due to toxicity or disease&#xD;
             progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Local access to commercially-available drug at no cost to the patient is permitted by&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. Active infection including active hepatitis C and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
        infection or active uncontrolled Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Screening for chronic&#xD;
        conditions is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with HBV infection are only eligible if they meet all the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrated absence of HCV co-infection or history of HCV co-infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrated absence of HIV infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving anti-viral treatment for at least 6 weeks prior to study treatment,&#xD;
             HBV DNA is suppressed to &lt; 100 IU/mL, and transaminase levels are below ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a resolved or chronic HBV infection are eligible if they are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative for HBsAg and positive for anti-HBc IgG. In addition, patients must be&#xD;
             receiving anti-viral prophylaxis for 2 to 4 weeks prior to study treatment and 6 to 12&#xD;
             months (to be determined by hepatologist) post treatment; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive for HBsAg, but for &gt; 6 months have had transaminases levels below ULN and HBV&#xD;
             DNA levels below &lt; 100 IU/mL (ie, patients are in an inactive carrier state). In&#xD;
             addition, patients must be receiving anti-viral prophylaxis for 2 to 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             study treatment and 6 to 12 months (to be determined by hepatologist) post treatment.&#xD;
