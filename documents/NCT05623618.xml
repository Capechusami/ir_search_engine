  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to undertake a cluster randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of&#xD;
      PACE food labelling in reducing young people's purchasing of discretionary foods in secondary&#xD;
      school canteens. Physical activity calorie equivalent (PACE) food labelling aims to show the&#xD;
      number of minutes or miles/kilometres of physical activity equivalent to the calories&#xD;
      contained in food/drinks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Physical activity calorie equivalent (PACE) food labelling aims to show the number of minutes&#xD;
      or miles/kilometres of physical activity equivalent to the calories contained in food/drinks.&#xD;
      Evidence suggests that PACE food labelling may influence food/drink choice. Most research in&#xD;
      this area however have tested PACE food labels with adults and/or have tested hypothetical&#xD;
      food choice scenarios. Studies in real world contexts with young people are needed to see if&#xD;
      PACE food labels could help them make healthier food choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to assess the effectiveness of PACE food labelling in reducing young people's&#xD;
      purchasing of discretionary foods in secondary school canteens. A cluster randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial with a nested qualitative study will be conducted. Secondary schools will be&#xD;
      randomised to either display PACE labelling near discretionary foods or continue with their&#xD;
      usual practice. The intervention period will be up to 6 weeks. Anonymised purchase data will&#xD;
      be collected throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative interviews will be conducted with students in the intervention schools to explore&#xD;
      their views of the PACE labels such as perceived influence of the PACE labelling on their&#xD;
      food selection.&#xD;
