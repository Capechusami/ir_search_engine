  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), a single low dose of intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      ketamine can help relieve symptoms as quickly as 24 hours later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main problem with IV ketamine for TRD is that the effect is short-lived, lasting only&#xD;
      days to 1 or 2 weeks. Furthermore, IV ketamine is a resource-intensive treatment, and the&#xD;
      safety of long-term, repeated use for depression is unknown. To provide this treatment in a&#xD;
      safe and cost-effective way, Investigators must allocate it efficiently to those patients who&#xD;
      have the greatest need and probability of benefit. Therefore, this project aims to find&#xD;
      clinical features (signs, symptoms, and parts of a patient's history) that will help predict&#xD;
      which patients are most likely to respond to a single dose of IV ketamine for TRD. This will&#xD;
      help guide patient selection and triaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will recruit 40 participants with TRD over one year, and randomize them to one&#xD;
      of two conditions (ketamine followed by an active placebo 3-weeks later, or vice versa). With&#xD;
      clinical data collected through detailed interviews and questionnaires, this study design&#xD;
      will let us evaluate how well such factors predict (A) rapid response at 24-hours, and (B)&#xD;
      sustained response at 7 and 14 days.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized, double-blinded, midazolam-controlled crossover trial. There is no&#xD;
      perfect control agent for studies of subanaesthetic IV ketamine, but midazolam is generally&#xD;
      thought to be superior to normal saline since it is not an antidepressant, yet is&#xD;
      psychoactive and thus should better preserve blinding. Participants will undergo psychiatric&#xD;
      assessment to establish diagnosis and determine suitability. After providing informed consent&#xD;
      for participation, the day before infusion (Day -1), participants will complete a set of&#xD;
      rating scales. The following day (Day 0), the participants will receive either a single&#xD;
      infusion of IV ketamine (KET) (KET; 0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes) or midazolam (MID) (MID;&#xD;
      30μg/kg over 40 minutes). Investigators will randomize infusion sequences in a 1-to-1 ratio:&#xD;
      KET followed by MID (K→M) or vice versa (M→K). Infusions will be administered on Day 0 and&#xD;
      Day 21, separated by a 20-day washout period. This duration balances the need to establish&#xD;
      comparable baselines at each crossover phase and the ethical consideration of not allowing&#xD;
      depressive symptoms to remain untreated for an unreasonable amount of time. Investigators&#xD;
      will obtain objective depression ratings with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale&#xD;
      (MADRS) on Days -1, 1, 7, 14, 20, 22, 28, 35, and 41. Participants will provide daily&#xD;
      self-ratings of depressive symptoms (using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms 16-item&#xD;
      self-rated version; QIDS 16-SR). Daily symptom monitoring will continue for 20 days following&#xD;
      the second infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive either (A) 0.5mg/kg of ketamine hydrochloride or (B) 30μg/kg of MID&#xD;
      diluted in 0.9 percent Sodium chloride (NaCl) over 40 minutes by an intravenous pump. The KET&#xD;
      and MID doses are similar to those used in previous studies, and selected to minimize the&#xD;
      possibility of unblinding. Participants must abstain from consuming grapefruit juice or&#xD;
      benzodiazepines for 24 hours preceding the infusion since the former is a potent CYP3A4&#xD;
      inhibitor that may reduce the rate of midazolam and ketamine elimination, and the latter&#xD;
      reduces the response to ketamine.&#xD;

The scores for each item ranges from 0 to 6 and total scores range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. Researchers will investigate the degree to which each clinical feature predicts the 24h, 7 day, and 14 day post-infusion MADRS using a biomarker prediction model.</description>
