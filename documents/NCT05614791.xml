  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measles, can be prevented and eliminated by vaccination, is a highly contagious viral disease&#xD;
      that can lead to serious complications, disability, and death. As a result of the World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF)&#xD;
      strategic plans, the annual global incidence of measles decreased by 75% over the period&#xD;
      2000-2015, and the estimated global mortality rate fell by 73%. For the current 2019 period,&#xD;
      the European and the Eastern Mediterranean Region has recorded respectively more than&#xD;
      two-fold and 1.5-fold increase in reported measles cases. As it is known, no specific&#xD;
      antiviral treatment exists for the measles virus therefore, vaccination is still the most&#xD;
      effective method of preventing disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the measles cases in districts where the refugees live&#xD;
      quite intensely.&#xD;
