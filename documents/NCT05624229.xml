    <textblock>
      Acute Variceal Bleeding (AVB) in patients with liver cirrhosis is a common clinical critical&#xD;
      disease, with a 6-week mortality rate as high as 20%. Currently, many guidelines recommend&#xD;
      the use of vasoactive drugs (terlipressin, somatostatin or octreotide) combined with&#xD;
      endoscopic therapy (Endoscopic Variceal Ligation (EVL), endoscopic injection sclerotherapy&#xD;
      (EIS) and the use of prophylactic antibiotics for patients with AVB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is a commonly used antacid agent, which has a significant antacid&#xD;
      effect, protects the gastrointestinal mucosa, promotes blood coagulation, healing ulcers,&#xD;
      effectively stops bleeding and prevents rebleeding. There is a consensus that PPI should be&#xD;
      used before and after endoscopic therapy in patients with non-variceal acute bleeding.&#xD;
      However, studies on the efficacy of PPI after EVL are still limited and lack sufficient&#xD;
      convincing. In the 2005 Shrestha et al. randomized controlled study, pantoprazole treatment&#xD;
      was found to be associated with significantly smaller varicular ulcers 10 days after elective&#xD;
      EVL in secondary prevention patients with cirrhosis. Lo et al. 's randomized controlled study&#xD;
      in 2013 found that patients with cirrhosis and AVB treated with PPI for 19 days after&#xD;
      endoscopic hemostasis had smaller ulcers and fewer overall side effects, but there was no&#xD;
      statistically significant difference in 5-day treatment failure, 6-week rebleeding rate and&#xD;
      6-week mortality. In 2017, Chuah et al. included 637 patients with acute bleeding from liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis, 80% of whom were treated with acid suppression therapy, and the study found that&#xD;
      acid suppression therapy had no significant effect on long-term bleeding and mortality.&#xD;
      However, negative effects of PPI have been reported in patients with cirrhosis, such as&#xD;
      spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatic encephalopathy. Jepsen et al. found that&#xD;
      patients with cirrhosis and ascites had an increased risk of first hepatic encephalopathy&#xD;
      with PPI use, and Riggio et al. also found that patients with cirrhosis had an increased risk&#xD;
      of hepatic encephalopathy and death with PPI use. Therefore, PPI use in patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis should be more cautious. However, the duration of PPI use in these studies was&#xD;
      long, and there are no data to clarify the effect of short-term PPI use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there is no consensus among the major guidelines on the use of PPI in patients&#xD;
      with acute AVB in liver cirrhosis, and the UK guidelines do not recommend the use of PPI&#xD;
      unless accompanied by gastrointestinal ulcer. The use of PPI was not mentioned in the&#xD;
      guidelines of the American Endoscopic Society and the European Endoscopic Society. The 2021&#xD;
      Baveno 7 guideline clearly proposes that PPI should be stopped immediately once AVB is&#xD;
      identified as cirrhosis. The latest meta-analysis in 2022 showed that the use of PPI before&#xD;
      endoscopy may reduce the need for endoscopic hemostasis in patients with upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, but there was no sufficient evidence to confirm the effect on&#xD;
      clinical outcomes including 30-day mortality and rebleeding. It can be concluded that there&#xD;
      is no consensus on the use of PPI in patients with AVB in cirrhosis, and the recommendations&#xD;
      of guidelines lack high-quality studies to improve the convincing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, there is little evidence for the effect of PPI use in patients with AVB in liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis, and there is no study on the efficacy of PPI combined with endoscopic therapy in&#xD;
      patients with AVB in liver cirrhosis. Therefore, we planned to design a multicenter&#xD;
      prospective randomized controlled trial to explore the efficacy of PPI in cirrhotic patients&#xD;
      with AVB. In this study, the following questions were investigated: 1. Can PPI reduce the&#xD;
      5-day treatment failure rate in cirrhotic patients with AVB; 2. Can it reduce the 6-week&#xD;
      rebleeding rate, mortality, and complications in patients with liver cirrhosis and AVB.&#xD;

    <description>Early treatment is mainly aimed at correcting hypovolemic shock, preventing gastrointestinal bleeding-related complications (infection, electrolyte acid-base disorder, hepatic encephalopathy, etc.), effective control of bleeding, monitoring vital signs and urine output.&#xD;
Medical treatment included initiation and maintenance of vasoactive agents (terlipressin, somatostatin, octreotide, depending on the participating institution) as soon as possible for 2 to 5 days, and prophylactic antibiotics (preferably ceftriaxone sodium or quinolones) by intravenous infusion for 5 days.&#xD;
Endoscopic intervention was performed within 12 hours after presentation and generally no longer than 24 hours. PPI was stopped immediately after endoscopic treatment.&#xD;
Early TIPS is determined according to the technology and concept of each unit. Child-pugh score 7 points with active bleeding under endoscopy or Child-pugh score â‰¤13 points can be considered.</description>
