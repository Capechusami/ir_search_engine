  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Double burden of malnutrition is an emerging public health problem among children&#xD;
      under-five years due to the inevitable consequences of nutritional transition. Addressing&#xD;
      these two contrasting forms of malnutrition (undernutrition and overnutrition) simultaneously&#xD;
      brings an enormous challenge to the food and nutrition policies of developing countries like&#xD;
      Ethiopia. Children under five ages are more vulnerable to DBM, especially during the first&#xD;
      year of their life due to high growth and inadequate diet. Hence, there has been a paradigm&#xD;
      shift in thinking to reduce its effect on the health of children. However, interventions that&#xD;
      are used to address these different kinds of malnutrition are implemented through different&#xD;
      governance and still, they are isolated and disintegrated each other. Therefore, double-duty&#xD;
      interventions can tackle the risk of both nutritional problems simultaneously in an&#xD;
      integrated approach through nutrition behavior change communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Therefore, the main aim of this pilot study is to assess the effect of selected&#xD;
      double-duty interventions on the double burden of malnutrition among children under five&#xD;
      years in Debre Berhan City, Ethiopia.&#xD;

      Objective: Therefore, the main aim of this pilot study is to assess the effect of selected&#xD;
      double-duty interventions on the double burden of malnutrition among children under five&#xD;
      years in Debre Berhan City, Ethiopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted among 456 under-five&#xD;
      children (228 for each group) from January 25, 2023 to December 30, 2023. This pilot study&#xD;
      will be used a one-year two-arm parallel cluster randomized controlled trial using clusters&#xD;
      as a unit of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes: The endpoints expected from this pilot study are decreased double burden&#xD;
      of malnutrition, improved minimum dietary diversity score, and decreased frequency of&#xD;
      morbidity among children using double-duty interventions in the study area.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention employed in this study will serve as double-duty interventions. The WHO policy short report from 2017 and Hawkes et al2020 .'s were amended and used as the basis for the DDIs packages. The main components of the intervention packages are the promotion of a minimum level of dietary diversity, avoiding unwarranted harm from high-energy foods, and controlling market foods from the perspective of the consumer. The following central criteria will be used to evaluate the study's intervention packages.</description>
