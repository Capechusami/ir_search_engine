    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate safety, PSA response, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the VTP850 prime-boost immunotherapeutic in men with biochemical recurrence&#xD;
      of prostate cancer (PCa) after definitive local therapy for PCa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VTP-850 consists of 2 components: ChAdOx1-PCAQ and MVA-PCAQ. All participants will receive&#xD;
      ChAdOx1-PCAQ on Day 1 (prime) and MVA-PCAQ on Days 29 and 57 (boosts; Intervention Period).&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for 6 months or until start of new therapy such as Androgen&#xD;
      Deprivation Therapy (ADT) or until development of unequivocal metastatic PCa (Short-term&#xD;
      Follow-up Period). Participants who have a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, defined&#xD;
      as ≥50% reduction in serum PSA compared to baseline at any time, measured twice&#xD;
      consecutively, at least 2 weeks apart, during the 6 months follow up will be followed for an&#xD;
      additional 18 months, up to 24 months from first dose, or until start of new therapy such as&#xD;
      ADT or development of unequivocal metastatic PCa (Long-term Follow-up Period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (15-18 participants) will follow a 3+3 design to determine the recommended phase 2&#xD;
      regimen (RP2R; dose level of both ChAdOx1-PCAQ and MVA-PCAQ, and route of administration of&#xD;
      MVA-PCAQ (IM or IV)) that will be used in Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will consist of 2 sequential stages. In Stage 1 of Phase 2, 19 additional&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled at the chosen Phase 2 regimen. If 4 or more of the 25&#xD;
      participants at the RP2R (including the Phase 1 participants who received the same dose&#xD;
      regimen) have a PSA response, Stage 2 will be opened to enrolment of up to 100 additional&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
