      The aim of this study is to map the early development of children with DCD and the diagnostic&#xD;
      trajectory in Flanders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Diagnostic and Statistical manual 5th edition (DSM-V) defines Developmental Coordination&#xD;
      Disorder (DCD) as early-onset deficits in acquiring and executing motor coordination skills.&#xD;
      These deficits significantly interfere with the performance of activities of daily living and&#xD;
      impact on academic productivity, leisure and play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although DCD can be identified during preschool, diagnosis generally occurs at primary-school&#xD;
      age. Before the age of three (t.i. infancy), some parents already express &quot;something is&#xD;
      wrong&quot; with their child albeit DCD is rarely diagnosed within this age-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge on DCD in children before the age of five is limited. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      twofold: to explore the early development of children with DCD and to map the diagnostic&#xD;
      trajectory of DCD in Flanders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A qualitative narrative inductive study design by means of audio-recorded in-depth&#xD;
      interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling: Purposeful maximum variation sampling will be applied.&#xD;

    <measure>Early Developmental characteristics of children with DCD during pregnancy (qualitative research) by means of an interview.</measure>
    <time_frame>20 interviews (duration: approximately 1.5 to 2 hours) starting from january 2019 to december 2020</time_frame>

    <measure>Diagnostic trajectories of children with DCD in Flanders by means of an interview.</measure>
    <time_frame>20 interviews (duration: approximately 1.5 to 2 hours) starting from january 2019 to december 2020</time_frame>
    <description>As we will conduct a qualitative narrative analysis of the interviews, no standardised measurement tools will be used.&#xD;
We will probe for the following field of interest:&#xD;
Did parents/creche/family/friends/school express concerns which have led to seeking advice/help? Which concerns?&#xD;
Which advises or what help did parents receive from who? What did they do with them?&#xD;
Which caregivers did they consult? What were the results/advices?&#xD;
Who diagnosed the child with DCD? Who was involved?&#xD;
Which elements led to the diagnosis of DCD?&#xD;
We will map the trajectories leading to a diagnosis of DCD in Flanders.</description>
