  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitors) for advanced and metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)&#xD;
      significantly improves patients' overall survival compared to chemotherapy alone. Despite&#xD;
      this milestone breakthrough, immunochemotherapy also has known limitations. Indeed, only&#xD;
      45-72% of patients achieved objective responses. It is urgent to find out easily-determined&#xD;
      and convenient biomarkers to identify patients who will benefit from such treatment modality.&#xD;
      Due to the luminal structure of the esophagus, the exact diameter of esophageal tumor cannot&#xD;
      be precisely measured per RECIST 1.1. Moreover, the definition of the metastatic lymph node&#xD;
      in which the short-axis lengths should be longer than 1.5 cm hinders the risk of missing the&#xD;
      smaller metastatic lymph node foci. Thus, it is difficult to implement morphology-based&#xD;
      criteria for evaluating the neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy response. The current study aimed&#xD;
      to investigate the role of iPERCIST in predicting tumor response and the short-term overall&#xD;
      survival of patients with locally advanced ESCC after neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy.&#xD;

        Eligible patients were selected according to the following criteria: pathologically&#xD;
        confirmed locally advanced ESCC (cT3-4anyNM0) that was potentially resectable after&#xD;
        neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy. All patients were treatment-naïve and had adequate&#xD;
        cardiopulmonary function. The exclusion criteria included previous autoimmune disease;&#xD;
        unable to complete planned treatment courses and no complete follow-up PET-CT scan.&#xD;
