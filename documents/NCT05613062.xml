  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Chinese medicine (CM) for the treatment&#xD;
      of subacute and chronic Atopic Dermatitis (AD) patients when compared to the placebo control&#xD;
      by examining the clinical symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind pilot study. The subjects&#xD;
      will come for a screening visit at week 0 (baseline), then at week 6±3 days, week 12±3 days&#xD;
      and week 16±4 days for Chinese medicine practitioner (CMP) investigators' assessments (Fig&#xD;
      1). Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), Children's dermatology life quality index (CDLQI),&#xD;
      and Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) will be assessed and filled up at different time&#xD;
      points. Eligible subjects will be randomly allocated to the treatment group receiving oral CM&#xD;
      granules or the placebo control group receiving oral placebo granules for 12 weeks, and then&#xD;
      be followed up 4 weeks after the treatment.&#xD;
