  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care units (ICUs) are care centers where many different technological tools and&#xD;
      equipment are used to support the highest level of life functions for patients with severe&#xD;
      physical condition. With the developing treatment and care methods, the use of more tools and&#xD;
      equipment for invasive or non-invasive procedures has increased, however, complications&#xD;
      related to the use of devices and the complications caused by them have also increased.&#xD;
      Intensive care centers are centers where invasive procedures are frequently applied and&#xD;
      instruments are used frequently, and central venous catheters (CVCs) are widely used,&#xD;
      especially for patient-related reasons. CVCs have become one of the most important tools of&#xD;
      intensive care units due to the different areas in which they are used and the benefits they&#xD;
      provide.&#xD;

      1.625 / 5.000 Çeviri sonuçları star_border A CVC is a cannula placed in a venous vein that&#xD;
      goes directly to the heart. 4 CVCs are used for frequent blood sampling, continuous Total&#xD;
      Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) administration, blood and blood product transfusions,&#xD;
      hemodialysis, long-term fluid replacements, drug treatments in cases where vascular access&#xD;
      cannot be used due to long-term and intensive treatments. It is used for a variety of&#xD;
      purposes, such as the delivery of inotropes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the benefits they provide, CVCs also have many negative side effects. The most&#xD;
      common complications are infection, thrombosis and bleeding. central venous&#xD;
      catheter-associated bloodstream infections (LVMI-CDE); It is seen as an important problem&#xD;
      related to the use of central venous catheters in health services in ICUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day the CVC is placed is recorded as day 1. Laboratory-confirmed BSI can be placed on the&#xD;
      3rd day of the catheter at the earliest, and the day after the catheter removal at the&#xD;
      latest.9 The most important step in the management of LVMI-BSI is the prevention of&#xD;
      infection. In order to prevent these unavoidable infections, precautions should be taken and&#xD;
      antiseptic rules should be followed during the placement, use and maintenance of CVCs. Nurses&#xD;
      are responsible for catheter care, monitoring and reporting in case of complications.&#xD;
      Therefore, the specific care given by nurses has an effect on other catheter-related&#xD;
      complications and increased infection. Catheter dressings can be considered as risk factors&#xD;
      for bloodstream infection. For this reason, the antiseptics used during the dressing are also&#xD;
      important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), another antiseptic, is a highly effective product that is&#xD;
      frequently used in dressings and wound care in recent years. Hypochlorous acid is also a&#xD;
      physiological molecule synthesized by neutrophil cells during phagocytosis and plays an&#xD;
      active role in the destruction of all microorganisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown in studies that HOCl inactivates various viruses, including coronaviruses,&#xD;
      in less than 1 minute. 26 It has been stated that the use of HOCl in eyelid inflammation&#xD;
      reduces the rate of bacteria on the skin surface. Twenty minutes after application of a&#xD;
      saline hygiene solution containing HOCl at 100 ppm, more than 99% reduction in staphylococcal&#xD;
      load was reported.27 In a clinical study of intraperitoneal wound care, in a randomized&#xD;
      controlled study with forty-four patients aged 3-14 years, 20 patients were lavaged with 100&#xD;
      ml/kg isotonic into the peritoneal cavity and the wound was washed with 200 ml of isotonic,&#xD;
      and 26 patients were poured 100 ml/kg into the peritoneal cavity. Lavage was done with HOCl&#xD;
      and the wound was washed with 200 ml of HOCl. It was stated that no side effects were&#xD;
      observed. HOCl is extremely ecological because its breakdown produces only brine and traces&#xD;
      of chloride gas. It is economical as its source is only unsterilized tap water and salt.28 In&#xD;
      a study examining the effect of stabilized hypochlorous acid solution (HOCl) on the killing&#xD;
      rate, biofilm formation, antimicrobial activity in the biofilm on frequently isolated&#xD;
      microorganisms and the migration rate of injured fibroblasts and keratinocytes, all&#xD;
      microorganisms were killed within 0 minutes and the exact killing time was stated to be 12&#xD;
      seconds. The stabilized HOCl solution had dose-dependent positive effects on fibroblast and&#xD;
      keratinocyte migration compared to povidone-iodine and medium alone. It was stated that it&#xD;
      can be used as an ideal wound care agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study on diabetic foot wound, povidone iodine was compared with HOCl. The duration of&#xD;
      antibiotic use decreased in cases where HOCl acid was used compared to povidone iodine. In&#xD;
      the studies, in soft tissue and bone tissue; It has been shown to reduce inflammation and&#xD;
      accelerate wound healing. Topically stabilized HOCl provides an optimal wound healing&#xD;
      environment and when combined with silicone can be ideal for reducing scarring. Used as an&#xD;
      antiseptic skin preparation, HOCl poses no concerns of ocular or ototoxicity. The fact that&#xD;
      it is cheaper than other antiseptic solutions for dressings and is effective in many&#xD;
      bacterial infections without damaging the tissue may cause more frequent use of hypochlorous&#xD;
      acid. This study is extremely important in terms of providing evidence to the literature.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that as a result of the correct nursing care and dressings made with the&#xD;
      correct products, the rate of bloodstream infections, mortality and morbidity, as well as&#xD;
      hospital costs due to the catheter, are greatly reduced. In this study, it was aimed to&#xD;
      compare the effectiveness of antiseptics containing chlorhexidine, povidone iodine and&#xD;
      hypochlorous acid active ingredient in catheter dressings in preventing central&#xD;
      catheter-related bloodstream infection in intensive care units.&#xD;
