      The goal of this clinical trial is to test the effect of the Family Talk Preventive&#xD;
      Intervention compared to service as usual for families where a parent has mental illness.&#xD;
      Participants are the parent with a mental illness receiving treatment from a secondary mental&#xD;
      health service within the last two years from inclusion, their youngest child aged 7-17 years&#xD;
      and the other parent of this child. The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is Family Talk superior to service as usual regarding improving?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The child's level of functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The parent's sense of competence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family functioning Participants will undergo interviews and fill out questionnaires.&#xD;
           Half will be randomized to Family Talk and receive a manualized, family-based&#xD;
           intervention of approximately 8 conversations with a trained, Family Talk&#xD;
           interventionist. The other half will be randomized to service as usual which is normally&#xD;
           two conversations with a professional in the mental health sector. The researchers will&#xD;
           compare the two groups on child's level of functioning, parental sense of competence and&#xD;
           family functioning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children of parents with mental illness are at increased risk for mental illness themselves&#xD;
      and therefore interventions aimed at mitigating this risk are important. The Family Talk&#xD;
      Preventive Intervention was developed by William Beardslee in the 1980's for families with&#xD;
      parental depression but has been widely used to treat families with other mental health&#xD;
      conditions as well. Nevertheless, only few high-quality clinical trials exist, and the&#xD;
      results are inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this clinical trial is to test the effect of Family Talk Preventive&#xD;
      Intervention compared to service as usual for families where a parent has mental illness and&#xD;
      receiving treatment from a secondary mental health service within the last two years from&#xD;
      inclusion. Participants are the parent with a mental illness, their youngest child aged 7-17&#xD;
      years and the other parent of this child. The hypothesis is that Family Talk will be superior&#xD;
      to service as usual in improving the child's level of functioning, the parent's sense of&#xD;
      competence and family functioning at 4 moths follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo interviews and fill out questionnaires at baseline, four- and&#xD;
      twelve months follow-up assessments. Half of the families will be randomized to Family Talk&#xD;
      and receive a manualized, family-based intervention of approximately 8 conversations with a&#xD;
      trained, Family Talk interventionist. The other half will be randomized to service as usual&#xD;
      which is normally two conversations with a professional in the mental health sector. The&#xD;
      researchers will compare the two groups on child's level of functioning, parental sense of&#xD;
      competence and family functioning and other measures including child's quality of life,&#xD;
      communication in the family and parental personal recovery.&#xD;
