  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cre8™ BTK is a CE marked drug eluting stent, integrally coated with i-Carbofilm, loaded with&#xD;
      formulated Sirolimus for the treatment of infrapopliteal peripheral artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this post-market retrospective study protocol P32102 is to collect clinical data&#xD;
      of patient treated with Cre8™ BTK stent in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to obtain long-term follow-up data, the data collection will be limited to patients&#xD;
      that have been treated with the Cre8™ BTK stent at least 12 months prior to the study start.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this post-market observational study is to collect retrospective clinical&#xD;
      data on the implantable medical device Cre8™ BTK in an unselected population, in the current&#xD;
      clinical practice treated within the intended use. Data will be collected via medical chart&#xD;
      review in anonymous form to assess the safety and efficacy of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cre8™ BTK stent is made of cobalt-chromium alloy (L605) and it is coated with&#xD;
      iCarbofilm™, a thin carbon film with a high density turbostratic structure substantially&#xD;
      identical with that of the pyrolytic carbon used for mechanical cardiac valve discs. Coating&#xD;
      the substrate with iCarbofilm™ provides it with the bio- and haemocompatible characteristics&#xD;
      of pyrolytic carbon, without affecting the physical and structural properties of the&#xD;
      substrate itself. The outer surface of the stent has dedicated grooves, fully coated with&#xD;
      iCarbofilm™, for containing the pharmaceutical formulation Amphilimus™, which is composed of&#xD;
      the drug sirolimus and a mixture of long-chain fatty acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific drug dosage is 0.9 μg/mm2 corresponding to a minimum dose of 50 μg on the&#xD;
      smaller stent (2.25x8mm) and a maximum dose of 395 μg on the larger stents (4.0x38mm and&#xD;
      3.5x46mm). Two radiopaque platinum markers, positioned at each end of the stent, allow to&#xD;
      correctly position it over the lesion to be treated.&#xD;
