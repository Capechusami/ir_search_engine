  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the usability and acceptability of the Addinex system&#xD;
      with patients receiving Suboxone in OUD treatment. The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are patients more likely to stay on their medication?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is the risk of diversion being reduced?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How is the usability of the Addinex system for doctors and patients?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prescription opioids remain a popular drug class with 142 million (M) opioid prescriptions&#xD;
      written in 2020. In that same year, 9.5M people aged 12 or older misused opioids representing&#xD;
      3.3% of that population and overdose deaths from opioids rose to 70,029, an increase of 37%&#xD;
      (which has since increased to 82,310 in 2021). The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed many&#xD;
      vulnerabilities in the treatment of patients with OUD. Of patients prescribed opioids,&#xD;
      between 3-10% will later develop opioid use disorder (OUD). Given that prescription opioids&#xD;
      remain the dominant route through which OUD begins, reducing their abuse and diversion can&#xD;
      translate over time into reduced deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients with OUD are treated by a combination of buprenorphine with counseling and&#xD;
      behavioral therapies, also known as Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT). Although&#xD;
      buprenorphine is less addictive than opioids or other treatments (e.g., methadone), it is not&#xD;
      invulnerable to abuse or diversion. There is therefore a significant opportunity for the&#xD;
      development of new technologies aimed at remotely treating OUD, and preventing drug misuse,&#xD;
      abuse, and diversion. Although several secure dispenser technologies are under development,&#xD;
      there remains a critical need for a comprehensive solution that prevents and/or treats&#xD;
      addiction, tracks usage, collects data, and eliminates excess medication, while also&#xD;
      remaining modular and cost effective enough to be widely accessible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addinex Technologies, Inc. is developing the only solution that combines: 1) a patented,&#xD;
      secure, low-cost and modular medication-dispenser which controls medication access and&#xD;
      encourages convenient and safe unused medication disposal, combined with 2) companion mobile&#xD;
      patient app and physician/pharmacist web-based software that features interactive modules and&#xD;
      surveys to improve patient education and engagement, caregiver monitoring, and teletherapy to&#xD;
      facilitate patient-provider interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addinex will conduct a feasibility and acceptability study for its app-based and text-based&#xD;
      system across patients (n = 60) undergoing OUD treatment. Successful completion of these aims&#xD;
      will provide critical insights to further optimize the Addinex system and to guide the design&#xD;
      of a larger, randomized controlled trial to demonstrate its efficacy and cost effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the springboard for the development of a system that is cost efficient,&#xD;
      widely accessible, and user-friendly, with the aim of increasing adherence, decreasing&#xD;
      treatment time, decreasing the misuse of medication, increasing treatment retention, and&#xD;
      reducing relapses in OUD treatment for the many who are suffering.&#xD;
