  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center study aims at NTRK fusion testing of all patients with advanced thyroid&#xD;
      cancer (any histotype and regardless of stage). The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the frequency of NTRK fusions in thyroid cancer. The secondary objective of this study&#xD;
      is to develop an effective tool (testing) strategy for the detection of NTRK fusions in&#xD;
      thyroid tumors, comparing the diagnostic tecniques available (IHC, real-time PCR and NGS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid cancer is the most common neoplasm of the endocrine system. Most thyroid carcinomas&#xD;
      originate from the follicular epithelium and are distinguished in differentiated forms (DTC):&#xD;
      papillary (PTC) and follicular (FTC) carcinomas. Both have a favorable prognosis and account&#xD;
      for approximately 80% and 10% of all thyroid neoplasms, respectively. The undifferentiated&#xD;
      form represented by the anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is less frequent (about 2%) and&#xD;
      represents one of the most aggressive human tumors with a survival that rarely exceeds 6-12&#xD;
      months. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), deriving from parafollicular C cells, is&#xD;
      relatively rare (approximately 5%) and is associated with an intermediate prognosis between&#xD;
      differentiated and poorly differentiated forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As to the prevalence of NTRK lesions, many authoritative papers and reviews claim very high&#xD;
      (up to 75%) NTRK fusion frequencies, particularly in the common PTC. However, an extensive&#xD;
      PubMed analysis back to year 1990 does not provide convincing support for this claim.Several&#xD;
      techniques for NTRK fusion diagnosis exist, including pan-Trk IHC, FISH, reverse&#xD;
      transcription PCR, DNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS), and RNA-based NGS. Each of&#xD;
      these assays has unique features, advantages, and limitations, and familiarity with these&#xD;
      assays is critical to appropriately screen for NTRK fusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of NTRK fusions in advanced thyroid&#xD;
      cancer patients and to compare the diagnostic tecniques available (IHC, real-time PCR and&#xD;
      NGS).&#xD;

      Tumor tissue is routinely obtained after the surgical removal of the tumor tissue (primary or&#xD;
      metastatic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part of the tissue will be immediately processed for RNA extraction, the rest of the tissue&#xD;
      is processed for conventional histology/IHC analysis and stored in the institutional tissue&#xD;
      biobank.&#xD;
