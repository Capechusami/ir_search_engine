      Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB, MED-EL, Innsbruck) Active middle ear implants (AMEI) can benefit&#xD;
      patients who are unable to use conventional hearing aids (HA) due to medical reasons,&#xD;
      discomfort or unsuccessful rehabilitation. Long-term prospective longitudinal studies are&#xD;
      lacking on the VSB notably for conductive and mixed hearing loss. The main aim of the present&#xD;
      study was to prospectively assess aided hearing benefits in a 60-month, long-term study&#xD;
      including conductive and mixed hearing loss adults implanted with the VSB. The secondary&#xD;
      objective was to compare the hearing results according to the Floating Mass Transducer (FMT)&#xD;
      site (Round/oval window (RW/OW) vs incus/stapes) and the type of pathology responsible for&#xD;
      the hearing loss (Inflammatory vs non-inflammatory disease, ID vs NID).&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active middle ear implants (AMEI) can benefit patients who are unable to use conventional&#xD;
      hearing aids (HA) due to medical reasons, discomfort or unsuccessful rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMEIs provide more hearing gain and consistency compared to middle ear surgery plus&#xD;
      conventional hearing aids. Coletti et al. (2013) reported on long-term outcomes of patients&#xD;
      implanted at the round window (RW) with the VSB. Brkic et al. (2019) presented a large number&#xD;
      of subjects (n = 23) with a 20-year follow-up. The limitations of these studies were their&#xD;
      retrospective design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best location for the surgeon to place the VSB's floating mass transducer (FMT) depends&#xD;
      on various factors. A meta-analysis showed the hearing results at different FMT sites to be&#xD;
      similar. None of these studies compared a FMT placed to a FMT clipped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of the etiology of deafness on a patient's outcome with an AMEI has been poorly&#xD;
      studied. Only one study has shown that the difference between inflammatory disease (ID) and&#xD;
      non-inflammatory disease (NID) groups was not significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospectively assess aided hearing benefits in a 60-month, long-term study including&#xD;
      conductive and mixed hearing loss adults implanted with the VSB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures are tonal audiometry, pure-tone average (PTA), vocal audiometry in quiet, 50% speech&#xD;
      recognition threshold (SRT) in quiet, word recognition in quiet (WRS) at 65 dB sound pressure&#xD;
      level (SPL), word recognition in noise (WRSN ; speech at 65 dB SPL and 0°, white noise at 55&#xD;
      dB SPL and 180°. signal-to-noise ratio = 10 dB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of the hearing results according to the FMT site (RW/OW to incus/stapes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of the hearing results according the type of pathology responsible for the hearing&#xD;
      loss (ID to NID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a multicentric, prospective, longitudinal study with 6 tertiary references centres with&#xD;
      a follow up over a period of 60 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures will be done on the patient preoperatively and 1, 3, 6, 12 and 60 months&#xD;
      post-implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative measures will be done also with hearing aid (HA) and bone-anchored hearing aid&#xD;
      on a headband (HBAHA).&#xD;
