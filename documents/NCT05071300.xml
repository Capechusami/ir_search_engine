    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of extended dosing with&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 study in up to approximately 140 participants.&#xD;

      (RDA) of vitamin A. This study will consist of the following periods: less than or equal to&#xD;
      (â‰¤) 8-week screening period, a 157 weeks treatment period, and a 24-week post-treatment&#xD;
      evaluation period.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Composite Autonomic Symptom Score-31 (COMPASS-31)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 181</time_frame>
    <description>COMPASS-31 is a 31-question participant-reported assessment that measures autonomic symptoms across 6 weighted domains on a 100-point scale: orthostatic intolerance (40 points), vasomotor (5 points), secretomotor (15 points), gastrointestinal (25 points), bladder (10 points), and pupillomotor (15 points). A higher score indicates worse autonomic dysfunction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in 5 Level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 181</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standard measure of health-related quality of life. EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and a visual analog scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1=no problems, 2=slight problems, 3=moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme problems. The 5D-5L systems are converted into a single index utility score between 0 to 1, where a higher score indicates a better health state. The VAS records the participant's health on a 0-100 mm VAS scale, with 0 indicating &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot; and 100 indicating &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot;. Higher scores of EQ VAS indicate better health.</description>
