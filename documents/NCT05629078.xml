  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cataracts are the major cause of blindness in the world. Cataract surgery, being the most&#xD;
      performed surgery in the world today, provide correction by extracting the natural lens from&#xD;
      its capsular bag and replaced by an artificial intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. In the&#xD;
      UK, almost all patients undergoing cataract surgery by the NHS are given monofocal&#xD;
      intraocular lenses (IOLs) which do not correct corneal astigmatic error. It is estimated that&#xD;
      around 20% of the population has over 1.50DC of corneal astigmatism. Uncorrected astigmatism&#xD;
      not only increase spectacle dependency and reduce quality of life post surgically, but it&#xD;
      also adversely affects the overall economic costs. Specialised toric IOLs offer the&#xD;
      opportunity to correct pre-existing corneal astigmatism. Previous work has shown a link&#xD;
      between reduced vision and balance or mobility. Full correction of refractive error may have&#xD;
      greater impact on lifestyle than previously thought.&#xD;

      This is a single centre, parallel randomized controlled trial study comparing the dynamic&#xD;
      stability and visual outcomes of cataract patient with astigmatism implanted with mono-focal&#xD;
      Toric versus non-Toric IOLs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      140 cataracts patients with astigmatism awaiting cataract correction surgery at the Royal Eye&#xD;
      infirmary of the University Hospitals of Plymouth NHS Trust will be recruited in this study&#xD;
      over a two year period. The participants will be randomly assigned to be implanted with&#xD;
      either Toric IOLs or standard non-Toric IOLs. Three additional study visits will be arranged&#xD;
      for them. One visit before the cataract surgery, second visit at three to six months after&#xD;
      the first eye cataract surgery and third visit at three to six months after the second eye&#xD;
      cataract surgery. The primary assessment outcome is dynamic balance measured by movement&#xD;
      sensors (accelerometer) during walk and turn, crossing over obstacle and stair walking. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes include eye tracking during movement activities, visual functions, risk of&#xD;
      fall questionnaires and vision-specific quality of life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is funded by Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, led by the University of Plymouth and&#xD;
      sponsored by University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust . The project also involves&#xD;
      collaboration with the University of Glasgow and the Plymouth Marjon University.&#xD;

    <description>Intraocular lenses are medical devices that are implanted in patients during cataract surgery. At Plymouth University NHS trust the standard lens is a monofocal non-Toric lens unless the patient has astigmatism greater than 4.00D. This study involves implantation of a toric lens in the intervention group where astigmatism is greater than 1.00D. The lens is called the toric IOLS- Zeiss AT TORBI, will be implanted bilaterally instead of standard monofocal IOLs- Zeiss CT ASPHINA, used in routine cataract surgery within NHS.</description>
