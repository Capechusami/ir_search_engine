      A prospective, cohort study comparing weight-bearing computed tomography with weight-bearing&#xD;
      radiography in patients with an acute Lisfranc injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Injury to the tarsometatarsal (TMT) joint complex in the midfoot is referred to as a Lisfranc&#xD;
      injury. The broad spectrum of these injuries includes simple sprains to severe&#xD;
      fracture-dislocations. Variable clinical presentations and radiographic findings make&#xD;
      Lisfranc injuries notoriously difficult to detect, especially in the case of subtle ligament&#xD;
      injuries. Nowadays, up to 30% of unstable Lisfranc injuries are overlooked or misdiagnosed.&#xD;
      This can potentially lead to severe sequelae such as post-traumatic osteoarthritis and foot&#xD;
      deformities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For obvious injuries involving diastasis, subluxation, or dislocation, the diagnosis is&#xD;
      relatively easy to establish using any imaging modality. However, for subtle injuries without&#xD;
      gross bone separation, a dynamic imaging modality facilitating weight-bearing are to be&#xD;
      preferred. Many consider weight-bearing conventional radiography as the current gold standard&#xD;
      in acute Lisfranc injury diagnostics. However, conventional radiography is a 2D technique&#xD;
      that can neither display nor measure the true dimensions of a detailed 3D object, such as the&#xD;
      tarsal bones in the foot. Computed tomography (CT) provides greater accuracy in visualizing&#xD;
      bone microarchitecture. In combination with weight-bearing, it can be ideal for detecting&#xD;
      minor fractures and occult instability caused by load/stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this day, there are no prospective studies comparing weight-bearing CT and weight-bearing&#xD;
      radiography for acute Lisfranc injuries. In the current study, participants will be assigned&#xD;
      to non-operative or operative treatment based on Lisfranc joint stability evaluation by the&#xD;
      initial weight-bearing CT.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Acute Lisfranc injuries are investigated with weight-bearing diagnostics to determine the degree of TMT stability. Patients are examined using both CT and conventional radiography during full weight and non-weight-bearing sequences. 3 foot- and ankle surgeons will examine the scans independently, starting with the conventional radiographs. Distance between the medial cuneiform and second metatarsal bone (C1-M2) is measured. For the CT images, measuring method previously described by Y. Sripanich et al. (DOI: 10.1007/s00402-020-03477-5) will be used.&#xD;
CT findings will determine the treatment outcome. If the C1-M2 diastasis is &gt;2mm, as opposed to the uninjured side, the injury will be determined unstable and surgical fixation will be recommended (Cohort 2). All other patients (≤ 2mm) are considered stable and treated conservatively (Cohort 1).</intervention_model_description>
