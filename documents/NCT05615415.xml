  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to develop PET/MR techniques for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric post-acute sequelae (PASC) of SARS-CoV-2. The central hypothesis is that&#xD;
      immunological and cerebrovascular dysfunction after acute SARS-CoV-2 infections mediate&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric PASC (NP-PASC).&#xD;

        The population will include neuropsychiatric PASC patients, as well as patients with a&#xD;
        history of SARS-CoV-2 but no NP-PASC. Potential participants may be directly identified,&#xD;
        referred through the ongoing PASC projects at NYU Neurology, identified by the NYU&#xD;
        Radiology research coordinators, or recruited via ads. Recruitment will strive to match the&#xD;
        two groups in age, sex and BMI.&#xD;

    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neuropsychiatric symptoms are defined as respectively a) objective cognitive&#xD;
             dysfunction on bedside cognitive testing (ACE-III (Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination&#xD;
             III) =&lt; 86/100, at least 12th grade educational level), and/or b) anxiety, depression&#xD;
             or psychotic illness as indicated by the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, evaluated with the&#xD;
             MINI (Mini International Psychiatric Interview) or SCID-5 (Structured Clinical&#xD;
             Interview for DSM-5 Disorders, Research Version). It is expected some patients may&#xD;
             fall into both categories (cognitive and psychiatric complications), in which case&#xD;
             they will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Infection with SARS-CoV-2 (3-12 months before study) will be verified based on&#xD;
             positive PCR test results provided by the NYU EMR or subject records. We will further&#xD;
             record the clinical history and perform nucleoprotein- and spike-antibody testing.&#xD;
             Anecdotal evidence shows that anti-nucleoprotein and anti-spike tests will be positive&#xD;
             in individuals who had past SARS-CoV-2 infection, but only anti-spike tests will be&#xD;
             positive in individuals who were vaccinated but did not have past infection, unless&#xD;
             the infected individual has already lost the antibodies due to natural infection .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to sign informed consent as evaluated by the UCSD Brief Assessment of Capacity to&#xD;
             Consent (UBACC) test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subgroup Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NP-PASC subjects will have new onset a) cognitive and/or b) psychiatric symptoms&#xD;
             following SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CC will have a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection but will not meet the criteria for any&#xD;
             DSM-5 diagnosis and will perform within normal limits on cognitive tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2, at least 3 months past the last vaccine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with suicidal ideation who require inpatient or intensive level of care, as&#xD;
             determined by a study clinician (Dr. Frankle or Dr. Iosifescu) based on the answers to&#xD;
             the screening interview. These patients will be immediately referred to appropriate&#xD;
             clinical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women or those who become pregnant as determined by a urine test at the time&#xD;
             of the blood test and on the day of the PET/MR scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Obese individuals (BMI &gt;= 30) and individuals with cardiovascular risk factors (e.g.,&#xD;
             uncontrolled high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia, current tobacco smokers or&#xD;
             smoking in the last 12 months, diabetes mellitus).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with history of serious or unstable medical illness associated with&#xD;
             chronic inflammation other than PASC (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current traumatic brain injury. Subjects with a history of chronic pre-existing&#xD;
             neurological disease (multiple sclerosis, degenerative disease such as ALS, Parkinson&#xD;
             disease and any movement disorders, etc), i.e. neurological symptoms should be new&#xD;
             onset for inclusion. Patients with substance use disorders, including alcohol, active&#xD;
             within the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical or laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism. A thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)&#xD;
             test will be drawn in blood, and the patient will be excluded if TSH is abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) within the 6 months preceding&#xD;
             baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who had recently taken psychotropic medications will be scanned only after a&#xD;
             period greater than five half-lives since the last dose of their psychotropic&#xD;
             medication. Subjects who choose to start treatment (with psychotropic medication) for&#xD;
             their symptoms immediately will thus be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications to 3T whole body MRI scanners (e.g., pacemaker, cerebral aneurysm&#xD;
             clip, cochlear implant, presence of shrapnel in strategic locations, metal in the eye,&#xD;
             claustrophobia, or other problems).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications for Gadolinium-based MRI contrast (allergies to contrast agents and&#xD;
             kidney health)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent exposure to radiation (i.e., PET from other research) which when combined with&#xD;
             this study would be above the allowable limits of 5 rem per 12 months as confirmed by&#xD;
             the Radiation safety questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If CSF sampling: contraindication for a lumbar puncture (i.e. intracranial mass,&#xD;
             bleeding diathesis, spinal developmental anomalies, or local skin infection involving&#xD;
             the lower back). Complete blood count and coagulation studies will be drawn, and if&#xD;
             abnormal (INR&gt;1.3, platelets less than 100), subjects will be able to complete imaging&#xD;
             studies but will not be eligible for the lumbar puncture procedure part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to sign informed consent or to comply with study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urine will be collected for toxicology screening (amphetamine, barbiturates,&#xD;
             benzodiazepines, cocaine, methadone, opiates, phencyclidine/PCP, THC, and tricyclic&#xD;
             antidepressants). Subjects in whom THC is found will be scanned only after abstaining&#xD;
             for 7 days. A pregnancy test will be performed on all premenopausal women to ensure&#xD;
             exclusion criteria are appropriately screened.&#xD;
