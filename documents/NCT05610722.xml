  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DreaMed Endo.Digital is indicated for use by healthcare professionals treating&#xD;
      individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) who use insulin pump or multiple daily injections&#xD;
      (MDI) as their insulin delivery therapy and monitor their glucose levels by using Continuous&#xD;
      Glucose Monitoring (CGM) or Flash Glucose monitoring (FGM), or SMBG above the age of 6 years&#xD;
      old and below 30 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DreaMed Endo.DigitalTM is indicated for use by healthcare professionals when analyzing&#xD;
      CGM/SMBG and pump or MDI data to generate recommendations for optimizing a patient's insulin&#xD;
      pump settings for basal rate, carbohydrate ratio (CR), and correction factor (CF); or MDI&#xD;
      settings for basal rate, carbohydrate ratio (CR), and correction factor (CF) or Sliding Scale&#xD;
      without considering the full clinical status of a particular patient. DreaMed Endo.DigitalTM&#xD;
      does not replace clinical judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is an open label, interventional study that will include up to 500&#xD;
      participants with type 1 diabetes using insulin pumps or MDI therapy and monitoring glucose&#xD;
      levels by continuous glucose monitoring including flash glucose monitoring or SMBG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be 12 months, therefore will include 5 routine clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, participants who use pump therapy will download their pump and glucose data&#xD;
      (V1-V5) as they use to do at clinic visit. Participants who use MDI therapy will use the&#xD;
      Endo.Digital App for insulin and glucose documentation and will upload data from their&#xD;
      CGM/FGM or glucometer as they use to do at clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants will be offered to download data also at home in between study&#xD;
      visits, every 3-6 weeks as they feel needed (Phone visits). Each time, optimization of pump&#xD;
      settings or MDI will be done according to the downloaded data using the Endo.DigitalTM&#xD;
      system. The device recommendations for insulin dosing adjustments and diabetes management&#xD;
      tips will be reviewed by the treating physician. Each new treatment settings will be approved&#xD;
      or edit by the study physician prior to implementation by the participant. At study&#xD;
      completion, glycemic control will be evaluated by measured HbA1c and the data obtained from&#xD;
      the participant devices and CGM/glucometer metrics, or Endo.Digital App data for MDI users.&#xD;

    <description>The DreaMed Endo.Digital uses information gathered from glucose monitoring (sensor readings or capillary blood glucose measurements), insulin dosing and meal data during daily routine home care. Following a 5-minute data collection and analysis, the algorithm learns and suggests insulin dose adjustments and behavioral tips for optimization of glucose control. The algorithm is designed as an advisory tool for health care professionals.</description>
