  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The participant is being asked to take part in this trial, because the participant is a&#xD;
      survivor of childhood cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate remote cardiomyopathy prediction via smartwatch and one clinical ECG and assess&#xD;
      the concordance of the two ECGs in terms of predicted risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To build a novel predictive model solely on smartwatch ECG to predict risk for&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is looking to compare the 30 second ECG read from a smartwatch to the&#xD;
      clinical ECG during a SJLIFE scheduled ECG appointment.&#xD;

    <measure>Standard 12-lead ECG</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To be obtained during SLIFE Human Performance Lab appointment. Participant will receive a resting (supine) 12-lead ECG using a GE Mac 2000 Resting ECG System (General Electric Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). This will be assessed with the Apple Smartwatch ECG recording to determine concordance of the two ECGs.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Apple Smartwatch ECG 30-second recording</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To be obtained during the SLIFE Human Performance Lab appointment, collected immediately after recording of the standard 12-lead ECG. A study team member will place an Apple Smartwatch Series 7 on the participant's wrist. The participant will be instructed to start the ECG, which will be a 30-second recording process. Once captured, the data will be automatically transferred to the IOS application on the study iPhone. This will be assessed with the standard 12-lead ECG recording to determine concordance of the two ECGs.</description>
