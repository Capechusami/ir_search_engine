  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The participants were recruited from elderly subjects in the age range of 60-85 years and&#xD;
      audiological assessments, cognitive function assessments, non-invasive brain imaging,&#xD;
      behavioral assessments were collected from the normal control group, the elderly deaf&#xD;
      non-hearing group and the elderly deaf hearing group according to the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. The project aims to investigate the differences in auditory speech and cognitive&#xD;
      function in age-related deafness at the behavioural level, and to investigate the central&#xD;
      cortical metabolic mechanisms in age-related deafness at the brain imaging level.&#xD;

      audiological assessments (pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry), cognitive function&#xD;
      assessments (Simple Mental State Examination MMSE scale, Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale&#xD;
      MoCA scale), non-invasive brain imaging (functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS,&#xD;
      EEG/ERP), behavioral assessments (functional near-infrared spectroscopy fNIRS, EEG/ERP,&#xD;
      PET/CT, etc.) were collected from the normal control group, the elderly deaf non-hearing&#xD;
      group and the elderly deaf hearing group according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;

    <description>The scale is divided into seven aspects, including time orientation, place orientation, immediate memory, attention and gauging, delayed memory, language and visual space. There are 30 items in the scale, with a total score of 30. Normal 27 to 30, mild cognitive impairment 21 to 26, moderate cognitive impairment 10 to 20, and severe cognitive impairment 0 to 9.</description>

    <description>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) is a rapid screening tool for abnormal cognitive function. The scoring criteria were: 26 to 30 points for normal cognitive impairment, 18 to 25 points for mild cognitive impairment, 10 to 17 points for moderate cognitive impairment, and 0 to 9 points for severe cognitive impairment.</description>

    <measure>Resting Electroencephalogram</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Electroencephalogram (EEG) is applied to collect the spontaneous and rhythmic biologic potential data of the subjects' resting brain, namely, 8-minute resting state data with their eyes closed without any visual or auditory stimulation, in a dark environment.</description>
