  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the impact of using a whole food plant-based&#xD;
      diet in the reduction of cardiovascular risk related to HIV in people who live with HIV&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does a whole food plant-based diet, nonrestrictive in calories and low in fat, reduce&#xD;
           the cardiovascular risk associated with HIV infection in people with HIV infection?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the whole food plant-based diet permit achievement goals in specific metabolic&#xD;
           markers of cardiovascular risk (such as Cholesterol, C Reactive Protein)? Participants&#xD;
           will follow a non-calorie restricted, low fat, whole food plant-based diet for 8 weeks&#xD;
           Researchers will compare standard nutritional care to see if there is a difference in&#xD;
           the main outcomes&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants in the group within the intervention will follow a Whole Food Plant-Based&#xD;
      Diet for 8 weeks, which consists of increasing the daily consumption of fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables, including sources of vegetable protein such as legumes (beans, lentils,&#xD;
      chickpeas, peas, etc. ), soybeans and their derivatives (tofu, textured soybeans, soymilk),&#xD;
      and whole grains (oats, wheat, rice, quinoa, corn), nuts and seeds high in omega-3 fatty&#xD;
      acids (chia, flaxseed, hemp ), minimize processed foods and foods high in saturated fat.&#xD;
      There will be no caloric restriction, however, visual support will be provided, in the form&#xD;
      of a traffic light, to distinguish the frequency with which each type of food can be&#xD;
      consumed. A small recipe book will be provided with suggestions for breakfast, lunch, and&#xD;
      dinner dishes. Patients will receive vitamin b12 supplements of 1000 micrograms twice a week.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The participants in the other group will attend a consultation with a nutritionist every&#xD;
      month in which will receive recommendations about nutrition and lifestyle in order to reduce&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
