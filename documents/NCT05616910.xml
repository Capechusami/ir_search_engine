  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes acute deficits in cerebral perfusion which may lead to&#xD;
      secondary injury and worse outcomes. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a vasodilator that&#xD;
      increases cerebral blood flow and is clinically used for hypoxic respiratory failure in&#xD;
      neonates and adults. The investigators will perform a randomized controlled trial of iNO&#xD;
      treatment in TBI patients acutely after injury. The investigators will then assess perfusion&#xD;
      changes with optic neuromonitoring, blood biomarkers, and 6 month clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to show that inhaled nitric oxide can increase blood flow in&#xD;
      the brain after traumatic brain injury, attenuating brain injury and resulting in improved&#xD;
      long-term function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use optical brain monitoring to determine changes in cerebral&#xD;
      perfusion and metabolism by iNO treatment in TBI subjects. Within 24 hours of enrollment, TBI&#xD;
      subjects meeting the inclusion criteria without exclusion criteria will undergo 8 hour&#xD;
      sessions of monitoring (4 hours on iNO, 4 hours on standard respiratory therapy) for 3 days.&#xD;
      During this time, Noninvasive Neuro-optic Monitoring (NNOM) device will be placed on the&#xD;
      scalp and cerebral perfusion and metabolism parameters will be monitored to assess for&#xD;
      therapeutic effect of iNO. There will be within-subject comparison of cerebral perfusion and&#xD;
      metabolism on and off iNO. Also, there will be within-group comparison of cerebral perfusion&#xD;
      and metabolism on days when iNO is given first vs days when iNO is given at a second session.&#xD;
      Additionally, these parameters from this group will compared to a parallel group of TBI&#xD;
      patients receiving 8 hours of only standard respiratory therapy for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the safety profile of iNO use in TBI subjects. During the&#xD;
      course of iNO therapy in the initial 3 days, study subjects will be monitored for&#xD;
      methemoglobinemia, hypotension, neurological exam changes, and any other adverse events.&#xD;
      These outcomes will be monitored for 2 weeks following the iNO treatment. Additionally, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess blood-based biomarkers of injury with blood draws at the end of&#xD;
      each iNO treatment session in TBI subjects for 3 days. During the initial three days of the&#xD;
      trial, blood draws will be performed at the end of each session to detect biomarkers.&#xD;
      Specifically, biomarkers that have been shown to correlate with injury severity such as GFAP,&#xD;
      NFL, UCHL-1, tau, and S100B will be monitored at the end of iNO session and standard&#xD;
      respiratory therapy session. This will be performed by using a novel assay termed SIMOA, a&#xD;
      sensitive detection method for blood-based biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an exploratory aim, the investigators will compare 6-month GOS-E outcomes of the patients&#xD;
      who received iNO to those who received standard respiratory therapy. Patients will be&#xD;
      assessed for their functional status at the time of 6 month follow up. Each patient in this&#xD;
      study will be compared to a patient who had similar demographic background, mechanism of&#xD;
      injury (fall, motor vehicle crash, assault), and severity of injury (based on Glasgow Coma&#xD;
      Scale) from an existing database.&#xD;
