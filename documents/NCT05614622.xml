  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study goal is to evaluate the influence of mydriatic drops on the development of&#xD;
      posterior synechia after combined cataract and vitrectomy surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cataract and vitreoretinal disorders often coexist, and with up to 80 percent chance for&#xD;
      cataract formation following vitreoretinal surgery within the first year, combined surgery of&#xD;
      phacoemulsification, pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation has&#xD;
      become increasingly accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main advantages of combined surgery include better visualization during surgery and the&#xD;
      elimination of the need for additional surgery, which translates to overall quicker visual&#xD;
      recovery and cost-effectiveness. Like the more exercised, two-step procedure, the combined&#xD;
      surgery was shown to be safe and effective with relatively few complications. However, one&#xD;
      complication seen more frequently after the combined surgery is postoperative anterior&#xD;
      chamber inflammatory response, and with it, the formation of posterior synechia, reaching an&#xD;
      average of 18 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of posterior synechia interferes with postoperative visualization of the&#xD;
      fundus, thus diminishing an important advantage of the combined procedure. Moreover, in a few&#xD;
      cases, it can even be complicated by angle closure glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no consensus on whether postoperative treatment after combined surgery&#xD;
      should include additional treatment to help prevent the formation of synechia. The frequency&#xD;
      and severity of posterior synechia after a combined operation may be reduced using&#xD;
      short-acting mydriatics. However, there is no sufficient data nor a prospective study to&#xD;
      support this as common practice. It is, therefore, we sought to better evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      topical short-acting mydriatics on the formation of posterior synechia after combined surgery&#xD;
      and compare it with standard postoperative treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Iris posterior synechia is an adhesion formed between the iris and the capsular bag, which holds the implanted lens in place. It is a relatively common complication observed after intra-ocular surgery. Viewed under the slit lamp at the standard ophthalmologist examination after surgery.&#xD;
Mild to Moderate synechia can interrupt pupil dilatation and interfere with postoperative visualization of the fundus, thus diminishing an advantage of the combined surgery.&#xD;
Substantial synechia may affect the movement of the aqueous from the posterior to the anterior chamber resulting in secondary angle closure glaucoma.</description>
