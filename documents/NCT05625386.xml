  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the treatment effect of Theta-burst Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TBS) on&#xD;
      patients with freezing of gait (FOG) and the underlying neural mechanism.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a open-label clinical trial. Forty patients with FOG were treated with TBS for 5&#xD;
      days. Each patient was given a high-dose iTBS of 9000 pulses/day for each target to stimulate&#xD;
      the lower extremity motor area and dorsolateral prefrontal lobe respectively. The stimulation&#xD;
      sequence of the two targets was randomized among subjects, and the stimulation sequence&#xD;
      within the subjects remained unchanged throughout the course of treatment for 5 consecutive&#xD;
      days (18000 pulses/day, 90,000 pulses in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the TBS treatment, the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire, the Timed up and go test, the&#xD;
      Standing Start 180° Turning Test, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, and the&#xD;
      Non-motor Symptom Scale, the Pittsburgh sleep quality index were obtained by a trained&#xD;
      investigator to assess baseline severity. The patients had receiving a battery measure of&#xD;
      neuropsychological tests(mini-mental state examination, Montreal cognitive assessment,&#xD;
      digital span test, verbal fluency test, Hamilton depression/anxiety scale) and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) scan in multimodalities, electroencephalography (EEG) record, and&#xD;
      biological specimens (blood, urine, etc.). In the second day after the last treatment, all&#xD;
      the tests, MRI, EEG and biological specimens were reassessed. Patients were instructed to&#xD;
      focus their answers on the past 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical symptom and cognition of participants were followed in one month and two month&#xD;
      after the last treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>The Standing-Start 180° Turn Test (SS-180)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes from baseline to 1-week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The participants walk for a distance of five meters from a sitting position and come back to the chair after turning 180° around a traffic cone in a 0.7 m × 0.7 m target box.The time during the 180° turn (SS180) are measured. The time is recorded in seconds, and the longer the time, the more severe the symptoms</description>

    <measure>The timed up and go test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes from baseline to 1-week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The participants walk for a distance of five meters from a sitting position and come back to the chair after turning 180° around a traffic cone in a 0.7 m × 0.7 m target box .The time during the whole course are measured. The time is recorded in seconds, and the longer the time, the more severe the symptoms</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOGQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes from baseline to 1-week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This is an very common clinical motor estimating scale for evaluating FOG. 6 items and each item scored between 0 and 4 points (24 scores in total). A higher score indicates more severe symptoms</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRSIII)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes from baseline to 1-week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This is an very common clinical motor estimating scale, 14 items and 108' in total. Higher scores indicate worse symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-motor symptoms questionnaire (NMSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes from baseline to 1-week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This is a very common clinical scale with nine domains (30 items). Each item was scored on &quot;severity&quot; range from 1 to 3 and &quot;frequency&quot; range from 1 to 4. Higher scores indicate worse symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HAMD (Hamilton Depression Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes from baseline to 1-week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This scale was compiled by Hamilton in 1960, is the most common clinical to assess Depression Scale. In this study, 17 versions were selected, and there were 17 questions. The subjects were assessed for their depression in the past week. Each question scored between 0 and 4 points.Higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HAMA (Hamilton Anxiety Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes from baseline to 1-week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This scale was compiled by Hamilton in 1959.It was one of the most commonly used scales in psychiatric clinic, including 14 items. It is often used in clinical diagnosis and degree classification of anxiety disorder. The subjects were assessed for their anxiety in the past week. Each question scored between 0 and 4 points. The higher the score, the more symptoms of anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes from baseline to 1-week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The commonly used scale of cognitive function test can reflect the mental state and the degree of cognitive dysfunction of the subjects comprehensively, accurately and rapidly. A total of 30 questions, each correct answer 1 point</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>changes from baseline to 1-week post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The changes in MoCA will constitute assess response to rTMS the secondary research outcome measure used to.MoCA was developed by Nasreddine et al. based on clinical experience and reference to the MMSE cognitive items and scores, and the final version was finalized in November 2004. We adopted a localized version (Mandarin version#includes 2 alternative versions) in line with the Chinese cultural background.It includes 11 inspection items in 8 cognitive fields, including visual structure skills, executive function, naming, attention and calculation, language, abstract thinking, memory, and orientation. With a total score of 30 or more than 26, it is normal. Anyone who has been education for less than 12 years will need to add one point to his final score. The final score of the higher the better, and we hope the subjects' scores will improve after treatment.</description>

    <description>The continuous theta burst stimulation (iTBS) protocol lasted 10 min and consisted of 1800 pulses. In the iTBS session, this 10min protocol was repeated for ten times (18000 pulses in total) separated by 50 min breaks (controlled by a stopwatch). MRI dataset should be acquired before the first iTBS session and after the last iTBS session.</description>
