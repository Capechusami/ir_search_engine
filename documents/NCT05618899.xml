  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a Randomized clinical trial and will be conducted in services hospital&#xD;
      lahore. The sample size of 50 patients will be taken in this study to find the effects of&#xD;
      high intensity interval training versus moderate intensity exercises on physical health and&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness in obese women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into two groups (Group A will be treated with high intensity&#xD;
      interval training and Group B will be treated with moderate intensity exercises). Eligible&#xD;
      participants attended three session per week. Overnight fast, resting metabolic rate and&#xD;
      blood pressure will be assessed. An oral glucose test will be assessed and baseline blood&#xD;
      samples will be used for lipoprotein analysis. Pacer test and step test performed in the each&#xD;
      session. A regular follow-up visits to department and a final assessment will be made at the&#xD;
      end of last week by using questionnaire and resulting improvement will shown in results after&#xD;
      completion. Data will be analyzed on SPSS 25.&#xD;

    <measure>Step test</measure>
    <time_frame>4weeks</time_frame>
    <description>the step test is designed to measured a person's aerobic fitness. Participants steps up and down, on and off, an aerobics- type step for three minutes to increase heart rate and to evaluate the heart's recovery rate during the minute immediately following the step test exercise.</description>

    <measure>Glucose tolerance test</measure>
    <time_frame>4weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The glucose tolerance test is a medical test in which glucose is given and blood samples taken afterward to determine how quickly it is cleared from the blood. The test is usually used to test for diabetes, insulin resistance. an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), a standard dose of glucose is ingested by mouth and blood levels are checked two hours later.</description>

    <measure>Lipoprotein blood test:</measure>
    <time_frame>4weeks</time_frame>
    <description>lipoprotein test measures the level of lipoprotein in your blood. Lipoproteins are substances made of protein and fat that carry cholesterol through your bloodstream. Lipoprotein (a) is a type of LDL (bad) cholesterol. A high level of lipoprotein&#xD;
(a) may mean you are at risk for heart disease.</description>
