      This study is based on the implementation of the method named &quot;Learning-from-excellence&quot;, see&#xD;
      methodology www.learningfromexcellence.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is a longitudinal cohort study based on data from both qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative data, presented in two different research articles, one qualitative and one&#xD;
      quantitative, using :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an electronic questionnaire on &quot;work-engagement, team collaboration and patient safety&#xD;
           climate&quot; before and after implementing Learning from Excellence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  focus group interviews to explore experiences with the method of Learning from&#xD;
           excellence from the view of healthcare professionals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One measure to improve patient safety, is to focus on improvements based on learning from&#xD;
      errors (Safety-I). However, it is advocated that learning also should be based on situations&#xD;
      where work goes well (Safety-II). Learning from Excellence (LfE) is an English initiative to&#xD;
      learn from what works well and provide positive feedback to staff to increase resilience. LfE&#xD;
      was implemented in a unit of a South-eastern Norwegian hospital trust between November 2022&#xD;
      and May 2023, using readily available resources from www.learningfromexcellence.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative data will be derived from five semi-structured focus group interviews, with&#xD;
      nurses, physicians and change team representants. A descriptive design will be applied, and&#xD;
      the data will be analysed using a more deductive, reflexive thematic analysis. Data from the&#xD;
      focus group interviews will be taped on a recorder and stored at a secured computerised&#xD;
      research place at Akershus University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative part consist of aggregated data reports derived from the annual Norwegian&#xD;
      hospital survey, which is a measure to explore connections between working environment,&#xD;
      patient safety and Health-Environment-Safety in Norwegian hospitals, with a 5-point Likert&#xD;
      response scale. From this report we derive answers from 18 questions, submittet on two&#xD;
      occasions (March 2022 and 2023), regarding the themes: Work engagement (n= 6),&#xD;
      Team-collaboration (n=5) Patient safety climate (n=6), Follow-up (n=1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gained knowledge from the focus group interviews in this study may provide in-depth&#xD;
      knowledge on healthcare professionals' experiences in the novel field of learning from&#xD;
      excellence, regarding the outcomes: learning, quality improvement work and resilience and&#xD;
      culture in the workplace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gained knowledge from the surveys may provide information if and how the method of&#xD;
      Learning from excellence method impact the perceived&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient safety climate,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  work engagement,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  team-collaboration and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  follow-up on patient safety improvement.&#xD;
