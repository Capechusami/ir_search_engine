      The purpose of this study is to see the impact of social visits, through weekly phone calls,&#xD;
      on quality of life and health outcomes of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and self-rated&#xD;
      health for adults who have experienced an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and to determine the&#xD;
      benefit of these conversations on the student volunteer's perspective of adults who have&#xD;
      survived a stroke&#xD;

    <description>Following the collection of baseline data, the study participant will be randomly assigned to a student volunteer to begin the social phone calls. The first phone call will be scheduled to occur within one week of the consent and baseline assessments. A minimum of one social phone call will occur each week for 6weeks. Each phone call is expected to last around 1 hour with flexibility to be shorter or longer. The calls will be unstructured and designed simply to engage in conversation with the participant. The length of the phone calls, days and times will be recorded by the volunteer along with a short journal entry describing the conversation topics and any information that stood out to the volunteer. If the stroke survivor and student volunteer wish to speak more than the designated one call a week, that will be allowed if both parties agree. The same student volunteer will conduct all six sessions</description>
