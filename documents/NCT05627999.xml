    <textblock>
      Haemorrhoidal artery embolization (Emborrhoid) is a novel method for the treatment of&#xD;
      haemorrhoids. Through the catheterization of the femoral artery and a selective angiogram of&#xD;
      the inferior mesenteric artery, embolic agents are delivered to occlude the SRA. Despite the&#xD;
      technical success rate has been reported to reach 93%-100%, clinical success ranges between&#xD;
      63% and 94% with rebleeding occurring in 13.6% of cases due to the presence of a significant&#xD;
      MRA in 24% of cases [BIBLIO} . There is no data in the literature on how the arterial flow&#xD;
      changes after the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the present study was to assess the reduction in the blood supply by&#xD;
      comparing the hemorrhoidal arterial systolic peak before and after Hemborrhoid by using&#xD;
      endoanal ultrasound (EAUS) combined with doppler. The secondary aim was to evaluate if a&#xD;
      relation exists between the reduction and the efficacy of this treatment by the Hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      Bleeding Score.&#xD;

    <description>Consecutive patients assessed at the Division of General Surgery 1, Treviso Regional Hospital, from October to December 2021 and candidate to the haemorrhoidal artery embolization were included in the study. Indications to the procedure were symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease (French bleeding score [FBS] &gt; 4), Goligher's classification score II or III, age &gt;18 years, failure of non-operative management (change life style, dietary modification, supplemental fibers for constipation, over-the-counter treatments). Signed informed and research consents were obtained. Exclusion criteria were age &lt; 18 years, Goligher prolapse score IV, pregnancy, previous haemorrhoidal surgery, inflammatory bowel disease. Use of anticoagulant or antiaggregant was not considered an exclusion criteria [stecca].</description>
