    <textblock>
      The study will be a pilot randomized control trial with a 1:1 patient randomization of&#xD;
      vancomycin powder placement at the time of surgery (compared to no vancomycin placement) with&#xD;
      the goal of reducing postoperative complications in patients undergoing an inguinal lymph&#xD;
      node dissection for vulvar cancer. The primary objective is to measure the composite rate of&#xD;
      postoperative complications within 30 days of inguinal lymph node dissection in patients with&#xD;
      vulvar cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the impact of intrawound vancomycin powder on surgical&#xD;
      site infections. The primary objective is to measure the composite rate of postoperative&#xD;
      complications, including inguinal wound infection (superficial and deep surgical site&#xD;
      infection), inguinal incision separation, and hospital readmission within 30 days of inguinal&#xD;
      lymph node dissection in women with vulvar cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include assessing the rate of seroma or lymphocele development within 30&#xD;
      days of surgery. Adverse events including allergic reactions (systemic or local&#xD;
      hypersensitivity reactions) and antibiotic resistant infections (based on wound cultures)&#xD;
      will be described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a pilot randomized control trial with a 1:1 patient randomization of&#xD;
      vancomycin powder placement at the time of surgery. The investigators will identify women who&#xD;
      are planning to undergo inguinal lymph node dissection for vulvar cancer and after consented&#xD;
      will be randomized to either receive intrawound vancomycin powder in the operating room or to&#xD;
      not receive intrawound vancomycin powder. Women randomized to receive vancomycin powder will&#xD;
      receive 1g into each of the irrigated inguinal surgical beds (maximum of 2g dose per&#xD;
      patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed post operatively at their standard postoperative visits typically&#xD;
      at 1-3 week intervals until adequate healing of their incisions. An electronic questionnaire&#xD;
      will be administered to all patients at the postoperative visits between 3-6 weeks to assess&#xD;
      recovery and complications. Outcomes will be collected until six weeks postoperatively. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted at a single institution&#xD;

    <description>Women randomized to receive vancomycin powder will receive 1g into each of the irrigated inguinal surgical beds (maximum of 2g dose per patient). After dissection and irrigation of the surgical bed, the operating room staff will open the medication vial and sterilely dispense the medication into a sterile container. The surgeon will place the medication powder into the irrigated and hemostatic surgical bed. The procedure will be repeated on the opposite side after dissection.</description>
