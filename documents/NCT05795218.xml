  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single arm post-market clinical follow-up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study investigates a CE-marked product that will be used per its Intended Use,&#xD;
      and all procedures involved follow the standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study to provide clinical evidence in support of DBS effectiveness&#xD;
      in the treatment of ET when delivered by the directSTIM DBS system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-one patients will be enrolled in this study. Subjects selected to participate in the&#xD;
      study will be ET patients referred to uni- or bilateral DBS implant who meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary effectiveness variables will be measured at baseline for the identification of the&#xD;
      worst limb (most affected by the disease), then 3 months post-surgery. Safety events will be&#xD;
      collected between implant and 3-month visit, to evaluate potential confounding factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the 3-month visit, subjects will exit the study, and continue to be followed&#xD;
      by their physician per usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will be conducted at minimum 3 centers in Europe.&#xD;

      This study investigates the benefits and safety of the use of directSTIM DBS system within&#xD;
      its Intended Use, to deliver Deep Brain Stimulation therapy to patients suffering from&#xD;
      Essential Tremor whose motor symptoms are no longer optimally controlled through&#xD;
      pharmaceutical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to show that directSTIM is not inferior to competitor DBS&#xD;
      Systems at alleviating postural or kinetic symptoms of Essential Tremor through the delivery&#xD;
      of Deep Brain Stimulation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be analyzed will be collected from ET patients referred for DBS surgery, who chose to&#xD;
      get the directSTIM DBS System implanted after discussing its risks and benefits with their&#xD;
      clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures involving the patient and the device follow the standard of care in place at&#xD;
      the site for DBS.&#xD;

        Twenty-one patients suffering from Essential Tremor, referred for DBS surgery, who chose&#xD;
        directSTIM, will be enrolled in a minimum of 3 sites in Europe to collect primary safety&#xD;
        and effectiveness variables baseline and 3 months post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The sample size has been determined for the primary effectiveness endpoint. Study subjects&#xD;
        will be representative of the target population since they will be recruited among patients&#xD;
        who discussed the need and agreed with their clinician upon the implant of a DBS System to&#xD;
        treat their motor symptoms caused by Essential Tremor.&#xD;
