      The primary objective of this study is to determine, in a healthcare setting, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of actual tDCS in reducing pain compared with placebo tDCS. This is a&#xD;
      multicenter randomized controlled trial with parallel groups (real tDCS vs. placebo) blinded&#xD;
      to participants, assessors and tDCS providers. The real tDCS group will receive a daily&#xD;
      20-minute session of tDCS (current intensity = 2 mA), for 5 consecutive days, while the&#xD;
      placebo tDCS group will receive an equivalent treatment, but the current will be stopped&#xD;
      after the first 30 seconds. The study will take place in 5 rehabilitation clinics in 3 Quebec&#xD;
      regions. One hundred and fifty (150) seniors aged 65 years or older with chronic (&gt; 6&#xD;
      months), moderate to severe musculoskeletal pain will be recruited (50 participants/region).&#xD;
      Follow-ups will take place at 1 week and 3 months post-treatment. The primary dependent&#xD;
      variable is pain intensity (numerical scale from 0 to 10). Secondary variables will be&#xD;
      measured using standardized and validated questionnaires: 1) pain-related interferences&#xD;
      (physical function, mood, quality of life) and 2) perception of post-TDCS changes.&#xD;
      Neurophysiological measures (pain control pathways).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale : Chronic pain is the leading cause of disability and affects a large number of&#xD;
      seniors. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which provides non-invasive&#xD;
      stimulation of the brain, is a promising avenue for relieving pain that is refractory to&#xD;
      traditional treatments. To date, however, its clinical efficacy has yet to be confirmed in&#xD;
      the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives : The primary objective of this study is to determine, in a healthcare setting,&#xD;
      the effectiveness of actual tDCS in reducing pain compared with placebo tDCS. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to assess the effect of tDCS on pain-related interference and the relationship&#xD;
      between the response to tDCS and the integrity of pain control systems (descending pathways&#xD;
      controlling pain circuits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods : This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with parallel groups (real tDCS&#xD;
      vs. placebo) blinded to participants, assessors and tDCS providers. The real tDCS group will&#xD;
      receive a daily 20-minute session of tDCS (current intensity = 2 mA), for 5 consecutive days,&#xD;
      while the placebo tDCS group will receive an equivalent treatment, but the current will be&#xD;
      stopped after the first 30 seconds. The study will take place in 5 rehabilitation clinics in&#xD;
      3 Quebec regions: Sherbrooke (n=1), Quebec City (n=2), Montreal (n=2). One hundred and fifty&#xD;
      (150) seniors aged 65 years or older with chronic (&gt; 6 months), moderate to severe&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain will be recruited (50 participants/region). Follow-ups will take place&#xD;
      at 1 week and 3 months post-treatment. The primary dependent variable is pain intensity&#xD;
      (numerical scale from 0 to 10). Secondary variables will be measured using standardized and&#xD;
      validated questionnaires: 1) pain-related interferences (physical function, mood, quality of&#xD;
      life) and 2) perception of post-TDCS changes. Neurophysiological measures (pain control&#xD;
      pathways), i.e., the integrity of corticothalamic and corticospinal projections will be&#xD;
      tested by diffusion MRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results: Our hypotheses are that (i) real tDCS will be more effective in reducing&#xD;
      pain intensity than placebo tDCS at 1 week post-treatment. This reduction in pain will be&#xD;
      maintained at the 3-month post-treatment follow-up of real tDCS. (ii) Real tDCS will be more&#xD;
      effective than placebo treatment in reducing pain interference with physical function, mood&#xD;
      and quality of life. Perceived improvement with the treatment received will also be greater&#xD;
      for real tDCS. (iii) Individuals with stronger cortico-thalamic and corticospinal projections&#xD;
      in pre-tDCS will be more relieved by actual tDCS than those with less strong projections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, this study will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of tDCS in the care&#xD;
      setting for the relief of chronic musculoskeletal pain in the elderly and to identify those&#xD;
      individuals most likely to respond to this type of treatment based on potential biomarkers&#xD;
      related to the integrity of the pain control system.&#xD;

This technique aims to stimulate certain nerve cells via short magnetic pulses directed to the brain.This stimulation release a potential.known as a motor evoked potential, MEP which is then recorded using electromyography (EMG). The magnitude of muscle activity generated for a given TMS pulse strength forms a measure of cortical excitability in the stimulated region.</description>
