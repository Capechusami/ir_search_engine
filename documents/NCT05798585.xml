  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are clear clinical and logistic reasons for pursuing the best possible post-operative&#xD;
      pain management avoiding the negative side effects of opioid treatment; in order to garantee&#xD;
      an enhanced recovery after surgery. A short hospital stay is fundamental to reduce patient&#xD;
      morbidity and costs. Regional anesthetic nerve blocks are an ideal option to achieve this&#xD;
      goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paravertebral block serves as an ideal approach for thoracic and abdominal surgery through&#xD;
      delivering segmental anesthesia of operative sites. Thoracic paravertebral block has superior&#xD;
      analgesia as well as fewer complications than systemic opioids. It has been successfully&#xD;
      applied in sternotomy, breast surgery, abdominoplasty, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. ESP&#xD;
      block is a recently described technique, with promising results in different scenarios. It&#xD;
      probabily has a better risk profile than PVB, for its lower possibility of accidental pleural&#xD;
      puncture and reabsorption of local anesthtetic than PVB one&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients over 18 year of age undergoing elective VATS lung resection at ORBV&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with inability to consent, contraindications to standard care, or factors&#xD;
             that can cause bias in interpretation, absolute contraindications to the regional&#xD;
             anesthesia techniques studied (patient's refusal, allergy to local anesthetics,&#xD;
             infections in the site of injection). Pregnant women are not a target study-group so&#xD;
             they are excluded for design simplification. Conversion to the open technique will be&#xD;
             a post-randomization exclusion factor concerning the main outcomes&#xD;
