  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to compare changes in information processing speed after 30 days of&#xD;
      intervention in participants with a dysexecutive mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and&#xD;
      receiving either cognitive stimulation by adapted visual exercises (Emeraude® software) or&#xD;
      the broadcasting of a television program without cognitive stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare, after 30 days of intervention, in participants with a dysexecutive MCI and&#xD;
           receiving either cognitive stimulation by adapted visual exercises (Emeraude® software),&#xD;
           or the broadcasting of a television program without cognitive stimulation :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  changes in information processing speed of each subtest,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  changes in cognitive performance,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  changes in executive functions,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  changes in walking performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the quality of life, after 30 days of intervention, of participants with a&#xD;
           dysexecutive MCI and receiving either cognitive stimulation by adapted visual exercises&#xD;
           (Emeraude® software) or the broadcasting of a television program without cognitive&#xD;
           stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the &quot;Intervention&quot; group, to study correlations between changes in information&#xD;
           processing speed index and the final level reached for each cognitive stimulation&#xD;
           exercise.&#xD;

      Attentional abilities are among the cognitive functions that are most frequently and earliest&#xD;
      altered during aging, particularly in the case of neurodegenerative diseases such as&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease. This decline can be the cause of a cognitive complaint in the patient or&#xD;
      his relatives from the prodromal stage of the disease. This mild cognitive impairment is not&#xD;
      sufficiently advanced to have an impact on independence and autonomy, even though recent&#xD;
      studies have reported an early modification of walking in this population, in particular in&#xD;
      the case of a dysexecutive MCI. The current challenge is to develop strategies to prevent&#xD;
      cognitive decline in these patients with MCI and to avoid conversion to major neurocognitive&#xD;
      disorders. However, while &quot;memory workshops&quot; are offered to patients with amnestic MCI, no&#xD;
      strategy is clearly identified for dysexecutive MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, the integration of sensory information is modified in patients with&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases, and in particular visuomotor difficulties in the early stages.&#xD;
      Measurements of evoked potentials during visual stimulation have shown that sensory responses&#xD;
      are preserved but cognitive responses are reduced in patients with MCI. Based on this&#xD;
      observation, an American team recently tested the effectiveness of computer-assisted visual&#xD;
      cognitive exercises performed regularly for 8 weeks in patients without dementia, and&#xD;
      reported an improvement in information processing speed and walking performance. These&#xD;
      results lead us to hypothesize that regular cognitive stimulation exercises using adapted&#xD;
      visual exercises could improve the attentional capacities and in particular the information&#xD;
      processing speed (=mental speed) of elderly people with a dysexecutive MCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complex brain stimulation software Emeraude® has recently been developed by the Centre&#xD;
      Régional Basse Vision in Angers from a software used for more than 30 years in people with&#xD;
      visual impairment.&#xD;
