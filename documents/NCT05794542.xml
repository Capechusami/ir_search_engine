  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological condition which affects more than 145,000&#xD;
      people in the United Kingdom (UK) today. The main symptoms are tremor (uncontrolled shaking),&#xD;
      slowness of movement and difficulty starting movements (termed 'freezing'). Daily exercise is&#xD;
      recommended to help with these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation can help to maintain a person's balance, ability to walk and help to prevent&#xD;
      falls. This can allow people living with Parkinson's to maintain their independence for&#xD;
      longer. Rehabilitation is usually carried out at face-to-face appointments in outpatient&#xD;
      departments in hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STROLLL (www.strolll.co) is a company that have created a programme of activities called Cue&#xD;
      X, to be used on augmented reality glasses. Augmented reality glasses merge computer&#xD;
      generated images and sounds with the real world. Cue X has been created specifically to help&#xD;
      people with Parkinson's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are aiming to recruit 50 participants through referrals from specialist doctors, nurses&#xD;
      and physiotherapists in Leeds Teaching Hospitals National Health Service (NHS) Trust. We will&#xD;
      ask these health care professionals to give potential participants an information sheet&#xD;
      outlining the project. A more detailed participant information sheet will be sent by post or&#xD;
      email to those interested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be an initial hospital appointment where written consent will be asked for and an&#xD;
      initial assessment completed. Participants will do a personalised, daily rehabilitation&#xD;
      programme using Cue X on augmented reality glasses for 6 weeks at home (monitored remotely by&#xD;
      a physiotherapist). A final assessment and review will be done in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to see if people with Parkinson's can use the glasses and do&#xD;
      exercises in their own homes. Benefits could include fewer trips to the hospital for&#xD;
      appointments and a more engaging way of participating in rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, this could lead further research into this technology as a new way of&#xD;
      delivering rehabilitation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a condition that affects the brain. It is the world's fastest growing&#xD;
      neurological condition which affects more than 145,000 people in the United Kingdom (UK)&#xD;
      today. No one knows exactly why the condition develops and there is currently no cure for&#xD;
      Parkinson's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The symptoms associated with Parkinson's are usually mild at first, but can become worse over&#xD;
      time. The main symptoms are tremor (uncontrolled shaking), slowness of movement and&#xD;
      difficulty starting movements. People with Parkinson's often have problems with walking and&#xD;
      balance because of these. This can make normal daily activities more difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is generally recommended that adults are physically active every day to reduce the effects&#xD;
      of sedentary behaviour. UK Department of Health and Social Care guidelines for the adult&#xD;
      population recommend 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity (equivalent to 30&#xD;
      minutes per day, 5 days a week) or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity physical activity a week&#xD;
      (gov.uk, 2019). This is no different for people living with Parkinson's. Indeed, people&#xD;
      living with Parkinson's are encouraged to engage in a daily exercise programme to maintain&#xD;
      their mobility, independence, and quality of life. However, it can be difficult to do&#xD;
      exercises because of the disabling symptoms affecting movement. In addition, as gait and&#xD;
      balance ability deteriorate, and the fear of falls increases, maintaining an exercise&#xD;
      programme becomes more difficult, leading to being less able to do everyday activities and&#xD;
      declining quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation can help people living with Parkinson's to maintain their mobility and&#xD;
      independence, as well as assisting in preventing falls. People usually attend outpatient&#xD;
      appointments with a specialist rehabilitation team for assessment and are commenced on a&#xD;
      treatment programme of advice, exercises and activities. People are reviewed regularly at&#xD;
      face-to-face appointments, with treatment plans adjusted as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One particular problem that many people report with their mobility is 'freezing' when walking&#xD;
      (termed 'freezing of gait' or FoG). This is when a person stops and is unable to take their&#xD;
      next step. Previous research has shown that there are ways to help people when they freeze&#xD;
      using visual or auditory cues to provide 'prompts' to take the next step. For example,&#xD;
      putting taped lines on the floor to step over, a light on a walking stick or listening to the&#xD;
      beat of a metronome. Most of the existing technology relies on someone else being present,&#xD;
      carrying a walking aid or the lines being in fixed places on the floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A company called Strolll have created a digital programme specifically for people living with&#xD;
      Parkinson's. It is called Cue X and is used with augmented (mixed) reality glasses. These&#xD;
      glasses are similar to virtual reality glasses except you can see the real world around you&#xD;
      with digital images overlain. The Cue X software is used on two existing proprietary devices,&#xD;
      the Microsoft HoloLens and the Magic Leap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cue X software used provides access to visual and audio cueing, with the potential for&#xD;
      haptic (tactile) cues in the future, in a single wearable device. For each modality, there is&#xD;
      a library of games which utilise cues. The cue-assisted gait and balance exercises that&#xD;
      underpin the games can be selected to form a rehabilitation programme personalised and&#xD;
      adapted to each user aiming to maximise and maintain the positive effect on gait and balance&#xD;
      over time. The Cue X supports independent rehabilitation, delivered in augmented reality, to&#xD;
      enable people with Parkinson's to participate in exercises without a healthcare professional&#xD;
      present, where previously without cueing, walking and balance training would not be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Augmented reality rehabilitation using Cue X has the potential to deliver engaging exercise&#xD;
      treatments that can be completed by a person independently at home. This could reduce&#xD;
      outpatient face-to-face contact time for staff and patients, while improving experiences,&#xD;
      accessibility and treatment outcomes.&#xD;
