  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is highly prevalent within general population, and shoulder impingement&#xD;
      syndrome (SIS) is a common cause of shoulder pain. A small number of clinical and&#xD;
      methodologically diverse trials have been published recently which show little evidence to&#xD;
      support or refute the use of acupuncture for shoulder pain. Some researchers concluded, there&#xD;
      is a need for further well-designed clinical trials. Our aim in this study is to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of acupuncture treatment on pain, range of motion, functionality and quality of&#xD;
      life in patients diagnosed with Subacromial Impingement Syndrome as a result of clinical and&#xD;
      radiological tests.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A randomized, prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial will be conducted.&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with shoulder impingement syndrome will be divided into two groups&#xD;
      (acupuncture and placebo acupuncture) The evaluation will be performed at treatment&#xD;
      initiation and at the end of the treatment and 1 month after treatment initiation.All&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated by the same physiatrist who are blinded to the randomization&#xD;
      process and treatment protocols.Primary outcome is pain which will be evaulated with visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS) for rest, activity, and sleep-disturbing. Secondary outcomes are&#xD;
      shoulder range of motion in all groups will be evaluated with goniometer, shoulder function&#xD;
      which will be evaulated with the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) and The&#xD;
      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Score (QuickDash) and quality of life in all&#xD;
      groups will be evaluated with The Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC).&#xD;

    <description>All groups will be evaluated for shoulder function with the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). SPADI:The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use. To answer the questions, patients place a mark on a 10cm visual analogue scale for each question. Higher results indicate worse function.</description>

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>All groups will be evaluated for shoulder function with The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Score (QuickDash). The QuickDASH only contains 11 items. It is a questionnaire that measures an individual's ability to complete tasks, absorb forces, and severity of symptoms. The QuickDASH tool uses a 5-point Likert scale from which the patient can select an appropriate number corresponding to his/her severity/function level. Higher results indicate worse function.</description>

    <description>Quality of life: All groups will be evaluated for quality of life with The Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC). Each item in WORC has a possible score from 0-100 (100mm VAS). Scores can be computed for individual subscales and summated for a total score, which can range from 0-2100, with a higher score representing lower quality of life.</description>

    <description>The patients will be recieved two days a week for 8 sessions with placebo needle. Selected points are Large intestine 15 Triple warmer 14 gallbladder 21 and small intestine 9. We will use the Placebo needle (blunt needle, tip obtuse, when acupuncture the feeling is similar to acupuncture needles into the skin, but it retracts instead of piercing the skin) to conduct acupuncture treatment. The retention time will be the same as those in the acupuncture group. The specialist will give the subjects verbal cues before and during the acupuncture manipulation, which further reduces the subjects' doubts about the authenticity of acupuncture in the this group. To ensure the implementation of the blinding method, all patients will be treated independently and avoid contacting with each other.&#xD;
