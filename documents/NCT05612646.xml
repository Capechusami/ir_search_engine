      As a form of non-invasive auxiliary care, Traditional Chinese Medicine acupressure can&#xD;
      prevent constipation, reduce medication for constipation, save medical costs, and alleviate&#xD;
      constipation among inpatients in neurology departments, as well as improve patients' general&#xD;
      ease and comfort of defecation, thereby improving their quality of life. It also provides&#xD;
      clinical nursing staff with a more effective, safer, and more comfortable auxiliary method of&#xD;
      preventing constipation, and can be used as a reference for the nursing of such patients.&#xD;

      Background: Constipation is a common problem among geriatric patients and in neurology&#xD;
      departments. However, using stool softeners and enemas yield only temporary effects and may&#xD;
      even lead to alternating constipation, diarrhea, and metabolic disorders. Because of its&#xD;
      non-invasive nature, Acupressure can be used as adjuvant therapy of integrated traditional&#xD;
      Chinese and western medicine to prevent constipation among inpatients in neurology&#xD;
      departments. It is necessary to verify that Acupressure can be applied to avoid and alleviate&#xD;
      patients' constipation, improve their comfort, and improve their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To explore the effect of Acupressure in alleviating constipation among inpatients&#xD;
      in neurology departments.Method: A randomized controlled two-group pre-test and post-test&#xD;
      experiment design were adopted in this study; neurology department inpatients were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either the experimental group, which comprised 64 subjects receiving Acupressure&#xD;
      on three acupoints (Tianshu, ST25: Stomach Meridian 25; Zhongwan CV12: Conception Vessel 12;&#xD;
      Qihai CV6: Meridian Vessel 6) or the control group which comprised 64 subjects receiving&#xD;
      routine nursing and fake Acupressure. The research tools included the Bristol Stool Form and&#xD;
      Constipation Assessment Scale.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Use the random number generator of EXCEL to generate the random number assigned by the computer, and put the serial number in the sealed envelope in sequence. After the patients completed the pre-test, the sealed envelopes were opened in sequence, and the patients were randomly assigned to the experimental group and the routine care group. The study used an assessor blinding design, that is, the data collectors were unaware of the patient group assignments until the end of the study</masking_description>
