  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare three types of radiation therapy for cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to the spine. The two types of radiation therapy used in this trial are External Beam&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy (EBRT) and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). EBRT delivers&#xD;
      tightly targeted radiation beams from outside the body. SBRT is a specialized type of&#xD;
      radiation therapy that allows high doses of radiation to small targets. This study will&#xD;
      include standard dose SBRT and higher dose SBRT. Each participant will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to either EBRT, standard dose SBRT, or higher dose SBRT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic spine cancer incidence is increasing; the primary treatment is radiation therapy.&#xD;
      Metastatic spine disease has been historically treated with external beam radiation therapy&#xD;
      (EBRT) with conventional fractionation, yielding relatively limited durability in pain&#xD;
      control. The increased lifespan of patients with metastatic cancer has resulted in an&#xD;
      increase in the incidence of spine metastases, which has led to a need for more durable&#xD;
      treatment results. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)/Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)&#xD;
      of the spine has exponentially increased, with the theoretical advantages of higher&#xD;
      tumoricidal dose and more rapid fall off between tumor and surrounding normal tissue compared&#xD;
      with EBRT. The goal of this study is to compare three types of radiation therapy to draw&#xD;
      conclusions on what is an effective treatment to reduce pain and increase pain freedom rates.&#xD;
