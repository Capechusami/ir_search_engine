      The primary objective of the study is to describe the natural history and utilization of&#xD;
      disease modifying therapy (DMT) among adult Chinese participants with SMA linked to&#xD;
      chromosome 5q (5q-SMA).&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 60 Months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, in the view of the investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event), requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event.</description>
