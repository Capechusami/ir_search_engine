    <textblock>
      Visualization of the posterior fossa brain spaces, their spatial relationship and&#xD;
      measurements can be obtained in the midsagittal view of fetal head, the same used for NT&#xD;
      measurement (9), and plays an important role in the early diagnosis of neural tube defects,&#xD;
      such as open spinal dysraphism (5), and posterior fossa anomalies, such as DWM or BPC (7).&#xD;
      However, assessment of the fetal posterior fossa in the first trimester is still challenging&#xD;
      due to several limitations including involuntary movements of the fetus and small size of the&#xD;
      brain structures, causing difficulties for examination and misdiagnosis. Moreover, it is also&#xD;
      operator-dependent for the acquirement of high-quality ultrasound images, standard&#xD;
      measurements, and precise diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of new technologies to improve the acquisition of images, to help automatically&#xD;
      perform measurements, or aid in the diagnosis of fetal abnormalities, may be of great&#xD;
      importance for the optimal assessment of the fetal brain, particularly in the first trimester&#xD;
      (10). Artificial intelligence (AI) is described as the ability of a computer program to&#xD;
      perform processes associated with human intelligence, such as learning, thinking and&#xD;
      problem-solving. Deep Learning (DL), a subset of Machine Learning (ML), is a branch of AI,&#xD;
      deÔ¨Åned by the ability to learn features automatically from data without human intervention.&#xD;
      In DL, the input and output are connected by multiple layers loosely modeled on the neural&#xD;
      pathways of the human brain. In the image recognition field, one of the most promising type&#xD;
      of DL networks is represented by convolutional neural networks (CNN). These are designed to&#xD;
      extract highly representative image features in a fully automated way, which makes them&#xD;
      applicable to diagnostic decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to these observations, we propose a research project aimed to develop an&#xD;
      ultrasound-based AI-algorithm, which is capable to assess the fetal posterior fossa&#xD;
      structures during the first trimester ultrasound scan and discriminate between normal and&#xD;
      abnormal findings through a fully automatic data processing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The application of AI in obstetric ultrasound includes three aspects: structure&#xD;
      identification, automatic and standardized measurements, and classification diagnosis. Since&#xD;
      obstetric ultrasound is time-consuming, the use of AI could also reduce examination time and&#xD;
      improve workflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: this is a multicenter retrospective observational cohort study and subsequent&#xD;
      prospective cohort study. The study design will be organized in two different phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase, the feasibility retrospective study, has the objective to develop and train&#xD;
      AI-Algorithm with normal and abnormal images retrospectively acquired during first trimester&#xD;
      ultrasound scan from ten international fetal medicine centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase, a prospective clinical validation, has the objective to test the&#xD;
      AI-Algorithm in the assessment of the fetal posterior fossa anatomy in a real clinic setting&#xD;
      with real patients from each of the participating fetal medicine centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Three (3) fetal medicine centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: singleton pregnant population who underwent ultrasound examination between 11 -&#xD;
      14 weeks of gestation in ten fetal medicine centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: To validate a novel AI-based technology, which could potentially be used as&#xD;
      a screening tool for fetal brain abnormal findings in the first trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: To improve the performance of the standard first trimester screening of&#xD;
      fetal posterior fossa ensuring its reliable sonographic assessment within a shorter time of&#xD;
      execution. To detect higher repeatability and reproducibility, allowing to implement the&#xD;
      ultrasound screening also in terms of efficiency on a vast scale, optimizing healthcare&#xD;
      resources In the first phase of the study, participating fetal medicine centers will search&#xD;
      their electronic databases for midsagittal images of singleton pregnant women who underwent&#xD;
      ultrasound imaging at 11+0 - 13+6 weeks of gestation with any fetal posterior fossa anomaly,&#xD;
      such as open spinal dysraphism, DWM or BPC. Normal images of the fetal posterior fossa at the&#xD;
      same gestational age will be provided by the promoting centers - i.e., Fondazione Policlinico&#xD;
      A. Gemelli, IRCCS and University of Parma. Clinical, ultrasound, prenatal and postnatal&#xD;
      information of each case will be retrieved from patient's medical records and entered an&#xD;
      electronic database collection file by the principal investigator from each participating&#xD;
      center. The acquired images will be anonymized, saved as DICOM and shared through a dedicated&#xD;
      cloud storage system which will be set up by the bioengineering team. Each center will be&#xD;
      able to access the web system using a personal ID and password.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase of the study, the algorithm will be prospectively tested and validated in&#xD;
      a real clinical setting with real patients from each of the participating fetal medicine&#xD;
      centers. Inclusion and exclusion criteria, imaging protocol and data collection will be the&#xD;
      same carried out during the retrospective phase.&#xD;
