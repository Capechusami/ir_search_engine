  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label single photon emission tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) study&#xD;
      to investigate the imaging performance of 99mTc-MIRC213 in breast cancer patients. A single&#xD;
      dose of 11.1-14.8Mega-Becquerel (MBq) per kilogram body weight 99mTc-MIRC213 will be injected&#xD;
      intravenously. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the SPECT/CT images.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      99mTc-MIRC213 is an nano affibody probe targeting HER2. The investigators will determine the&#xD;
      use of 99mTc-MIRC213 SPECT/CT in the detection of HER2- positive breast cancer, and to&#xD;
      compare its diagnostic value with routine immunohistochemistry (IHC) pathological staining.&#xD;
      HER2 imaging, specifically to HER2 receptor expressed on malignant breast cancer cell&#xD;
      surface, might help for targeted therapy with monoclonal antibody such as trastuzumab in&#xD;
      breast cancer, and may improve the treatment strategy of breast cancer. The investigator will&#xD;
      determine the use of 99mTc-MIRC213 SPECT/CT in stratifying breast cancer.&#xD;
