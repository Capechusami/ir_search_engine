    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine the role of a type of immune cell in blood,&#xD;
      called a non-classical monocytes (NCMs), following consumption of a high-fat meal. Previous&#xD;
      studies have found that monocytes are important for blood vessel health. In this study, two&#xD;
      different high-fat meals will be used to study the effect of different types of dietary fat&#xD;
      on postprandial NCMs. The investigators will characterize NCMs in both fasting conditions and&#xD;
      following consumption of two different high-fat meals, and will evaluate whether the type of&#xD;
      fat in a meal affects NCMs in blood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Monocytes are a heterogeneous population of circulating blood cells that contribute to tissue&#xD;
      integrity as well as to innate and adaptive immune defense. There are three&#xD;
      well-characterized subsets based on their relative expression of surface antigens, cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 14 (CD14) and cluster of differentiation 16 (CD16). Monocytes originate from&#xD;
      myeloid precursors in the bone marrow and enter the circulation as classical monocytes&#xD;
      (CLMs). CLMs represent a transient cell population with a diverse differentiation potential.&#xD;
      CLMs comprise 80-90% of the circulating blood monocyte pool and remain in circulation for&#xD;
      approximately one day before either migrating into tissue to repopulate the tissue resident&#xD;
      macrophage population or maturing into non-classical monocytes (NCMs). NCMs comprise only&#xD;
      5-10% of the circulating blood monocyte pool but have a much longer circulating lifespan of&#xD;
      approximately 7 days. NCMs exhibit conflicting functions as anti-inflammatory caretakers of&#xD;
      vascular tissue and as contributors to the pathogenesis of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic responses to food consumption influence the risk of cardiometabolic disease.&#xD;
      Postprandial glycemia and lipemia modulate vascular health by altering endothelial function&#xD;
      and inducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Consumption of a single high-fat&#xD;
      meal increases circulating interleukin 6 (IL-6), enhances expression of monocyte adhesion&#xD;
      molecules, reduces flow-mediated dilation, and increases markers of oxidative stress in human&#xD;
      subjects. Although NCMs are described as vascular housekeepers with distinct motility and&#xD;
      crawling patterns allowing them to actively surveil endothelium and scavenge luminal debris,&#xD;
      their role in the postprandial state is currently unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand the function of postprandial NCMs following consumption of a single&#xD;
      high-fat mixed macronutrient challenge meal, the investigators propose a study following a&#xD;
      crossover design in which participants will consume one of two isocaloric high-fat challenge&#xD;
      meals spaced two-weeks apart, a high-saturated fat mixed macronutrient challenge meal or a&#xD;
      high-monounsaturated fat mixed macronutrient challenge meal. Blood at fasting and at six&#xD;
      hours postprandial will be collected and the proportion of NCMs and their integrin expression&#xD;
      will be analyzed by flow cytometry while changes in global gene expression will be measured&#xD;
      by RNA-sequencing.&#xD;
