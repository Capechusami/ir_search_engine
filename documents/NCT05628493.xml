  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the rapid development of intensive care medicine, the mortality of patients with sepsis&#xD;
      has decreased over the past decade, but it is still the leading cause of death in intensive&#xD;
      care unit (ICU). As an important immune and metabolic organ, the liver plays a crucial role&#xD;
      in host defense against invading pathogens and endotoxins, as well as maintenance of&#xD;
      metabolic and immunological homeostasis. Some studies indicate that sepsis-associated liver&#xD;
      dysfunction (SALD) has a substantial impact on the severity and prognosis of sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-abdominal infections (IAI) are the second leading source of infection for sepsis after&#xD;
      pneumonia in ICU, and are often related to high morbidity and mortality rates. Studies had&#xD;
      found that the incidence of SALD in IAI patients was considerably higher than that of general&#xD;
      population with sepsis. Moreover, the incidence of acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) in IAI&#xD;
      patients was also much higher than that in sepsis patients with other site infections, as&#xD;
      well as the degree of AGI was more serious according to guidelines proposed by the European&#xD;
      Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) in 2012. IAI can directly cause AGI, and a subset&#xD;
      of patients usually progress to increased intra-abdominal pressure, which further aggravates&#xD;
      AGI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of SALD remains unclear so far, and its mechanism is complicated and&#xD;
      elusive. Nevertheless, the unique anatomical structure of the liver make it has close&#xD;
      association with the gut, growing evidence indicates that the gut microbiota and related&#xD;
      metabolites are related to several liver disease. In case of sepsis, gut microbiota disorder&#xD;
      and low microbial diversity can cause severe liver injury. An important mechanism for this&#xD;
      phenotype is the gut-liver axis, which refers to gut microbial metabolites and nutrients are&#xD;
      transported to the liver through the portal vein and hepatic artery to maintain the healthy&#xD;
      metabolism of liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we initially conducted a retrospective study to investigate the relationship&#xD;
      between the occurrence of AGI and SALD among IAI patients. Subsequently, a prospective study&#xD;
      was performed to analyze and compare the diversity and composition of gut microbiota in IAI&#xD;
      patients with or without SALD, respectively, and the dynamic changes in the gut microbiota&#xD;
      during the first week after ICU admission were also investigated.&#xD;

      A retrospective cohort study was conducted involving sepsis patients with IAI treated in ICU&#xD;
      department of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital between April 2020 to April 2020. Adult patients&#xD;
      (≥18 years) with IAI who met the criteria for sepsis 3.0 were included. The exclusion&#xD;
      criteria included: discharged or died within 48 hours after ICU admission; known serious&#xD;
      chronic liver disease, such as decompensated cirrhosis and end-stage liver cancer;&#xD;
      hospitalization due to primary hepatobiliary disease, such as trauma, hepatitis,&#xD;
      cholelithiasis, etc; other causes of liver injury include: drugs, poisons, etc; and&#xD;
      pregnancy.The following data were collected within 24 hours after ICU admission: demographic&#xD;
      Information: age, sex and comorbidity; the score of disease severity: Acute Physiology and&#xD;
      Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)&#xD;
      score; the primary site of abdominal infection: upper or lower gastrointestinal tract,&#xD;
      pancreas and others; laboratory indicators: white blood cells (WBC), percentage of&#xD;
      neutrophils (N%), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), human leukocyte antigen&#xD;
      (HLA)-DR. Date during hospitalization were also collected: complications: respiratory&#xD;
      failure, septic shock, acute kidney injury (AKI) and AGI; pathogenic bacteria of ascites&#xD;
      culture; bacteremia or not; total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was given or not. Prognostic&#xD;
      indicators included ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, ICU mortality, in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality, and 28-day mortality were also recorded.SALD was diagnosed when the level of serum&#xD;
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 1000IU/L, or total&#xD;
      bilirubin (TBIL) level &gt;3mg/dL during hospitalization. IAI was diagnosed according to the&#xD;
      2005 International Sepsis Forum Consensus Conference. Briefly, the patient present with&#xD;
      abdominal symptoms and signs, such as fever (≥38℃), tenderness, rebound pain, etc; elevated&#xD;
      inflammatory indicators in peripheral blood and positive culture of intra-abdominal&#xD;
      specimens. Sepsis 3.0 and septic shock were diagnosed according to Third International&#xD;
      Consensus Definition for Sepsis and Septic Shock in 2016. AKI was diagnosed according to the&#xD;
      Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines. AGI diagnosis&#xD;
      and grading are based on the ESICM recommendations in 2012.To further clarify the&#xD;
      relationship between gut microbiota and SALD, we conducted a prospective observational study&#xD;
      between April 2020 to April 2020 in our center. Eligible patients must fulfill the same&#xD;
      criteria as above. Other exclusion criteria also include: with expected ICU LOS &lt; 1 week; had&#xD;
      participated in any other clinical trial; underwent enterostomy surgery; had chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease. All eligible patients were given antibiotics therapy, actively&#xD;
      control infection source by puncture drainage or surgery if necessary, as well as other&#xD;
      supportive therapy to maintain organ function. Moreover, fecal samples were collected per&#xD;
      patient on days 1,3 and 7 after ICU admission. Other data collection and the definition of&#xD;
      related diseases are the same as the above.&#xD;
