  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalization is often a traumatic event so stressful for the life of patients. Isolation,&#xD;
      loneliness, worries about clinical examinations, results from examinations and final&#xD;
      diagnosis, uncertainty about the future are the most common feelings that patients report&#xD;
      when during hospitalized for different disease conditions; these feelings are not related to&#xD;
      the pathological condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also the discomfort of the caregivers is significant, as the necessities and priorities of&#xD;
      the family change significantly during the hospitalization of a member (worries about the&#xD;
      future, help and support are not enough to sustain the situation, problems with the work&#xD;
      schedule ). Nowadays in North American and North European countries, mindfulness practice is&#xD;
      offered to patients by multifaith Chaplaincy teams and health-care operators (e.g.&#xD;
      physicians, nurses, psychologists), as a way of helping patients come to terms with diagnosis&#xD;
      and adjust to their prognosis. To the extent that patients can bear it, instructions are&#xD;
      given to keep coming back to the present moment, here and now, to bodily and affective&#xD;
      experience, relaxing in it. To that purpose patients are encouraged to accept the situation&#xD;
      as it develops, and let go of excessive concerns and unhelpful narratives that undermine the&#xD;
      capacity to manage pain, fear and suffering. Moreover, similar programmes are designed for&#xD;
      caregivers and the patients' families, aimed at developing their resilience in delivering the&#xD;
      support, via face-to-face sessions, and instructions and encouragement for a regular practice&#xD;
      at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last years, due to the dramatic emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic, different&#xD;
      applications for mindfulness have been realized by specific APPs or web platforms that allow&#xD;
      patients to practice mindfulness regularly guided by a physician or an expert in mindfulness:&#xD;
      patients can stay at home and mindfulness sessions can be delivered by technological&#xD;
      modalities. In different hospitals, protocols have been implemented for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients remotely, using specific platforms or APPs. These remote interventions are&#xD;
      complementary to the regular face-to-face sessions and they are suitable for most patients&#xD;
      and easily applied.&#xD;

      Background: Hospitalization is often a traumatic event so stressful for the life of patients.&#xD;
      Isolation, loneliness, worries about clinical examinations, results from examinations and&#xD;
      final diagnosis, uncertainty about the future are the most common feelings that patients&#xD;
      report when they are hospitalized for different disease conditions; these states of mind may&#xD;
      be experienced independently of the type of pathological condition they are affected by Also&#xD;
      the discomfort of the caregivers is significant, as the necessities and priorities of the&#xD;
      family change significantly during the hospitalization of a member (worries about the future,&#xD;
      help and support are not enough to sustain the situation, problems with the work schedule )&#xD;
      Significance: The practice of mindfulness has become common in different clinical&#xD;
      applications, pain, anxiety and other kinds of disease. In particular protocols based on&#xD;
      mindfulness practice are often combined to pharmacological therapies, as initial findings&#xD;
      support the utility of mindfulness intervention to modulate attention and emotional reactions&#xD;
      to pain chronification Meditation has a long history of use for increasing calmness and&#xD;
      physical relaxation, improving psychological balance, coping with illness, and enhancing&#xD;
      overall health and well-being. The practice has the purpose to teach individuals how to&#xD;
      maintain focus on a stimulus while simultaneously allowing intruding thoughts/feelings to be&#xD;
      acknowledged, but not judged.&#xD;
