  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of Cannabidiol (CBD) as an&#xD;
      adjunctive treatment for comorbid opioid use disorder (OUD) and chronic pain. This is a&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover human laboratory study investigating the&#xD;
      dose-dependent safety and acute effects of CBD on measures of pain and opioid craving in&#xD;
      outpatients with OUD receiving medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with methadone or&#xD;
      buprenorphine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An initial safety pilot phase will recruit six participants: three receiving treatment with&#xD;
      methadone and three receiving treatment with buprenorphine. If the results of the pilot study&#xD;
      support the safety of CBD administration in this clinical sample, the general study will&#xD;
      recruit 48 participants with comorbid OUD and chronic pain, for a total of 24 completers - 12&#xD;
      subjects (6 men and 6 women) receiving methadone and 12 subjects (6 men and 6 women)&#xD;
      receiving buprenorphine. Both sub-studies will enroll participants who do not currently&#xD;
      require an inpatient hospitalization.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Agitation Calmness Evaluation Scale (ACES)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The ACES consists of a single item that rates overall agitation and sedation of the participant at the time of evaluation, where 1 indicates marked agitation; 2: moderate agitation; 3: mild agitation; 4: normal behavior; 5: mild calmness; 6: moderate calmness; 7: marked calmness; 8: deep sleep; and 9: unarousable. Clinically significant sedation was a priori defined as an ACES score of 7 (marked calmness) or higher at any point during the session.</description>

    <measure>Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is a 30-point scale that measures five areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. The MMSE is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment. A score of 23 or lower is indicative of cognitive impairment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Systematic Assessment of Side Effects (SAFTEE)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The SAFTEE is a multi-symptom checklist that has been used successfully in our previous studies to assess and monitor any adverse events and possible side effects of study medications. It includes information regarding the severity of any presenting symptoms (0= none, 1= mild, 2= moderate, and 3= severe), as well as the course of action taken by the study staff in response. The SAFTEE was administered before the administration of CBD at baseline, (timepoint -30 minutes) and 4.5 hours after the administration of CBD (timepoint +240 minutes) during each test session. We did not observe evidence of &quot;confusion&quot;, &quot;fatigue&quot;, &quot;inability to respond to things&quot;, &quot;slowed thinking&quot;, &quot;dizziness/lightheadedness&quot;, &quot;weakness&quot;, &quot;slowed movements&quot;, or &quot;lack of coordination&quot;.</description>

    <measure>The Heroin Craving Questionnaire - Short Form 14 (HCQ-SF-14)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The HCQ-14 consists of 14 statements about the respondent's feelings and thoughts about using heroin as he or she is completing the questionnaire (i.e., right now).</description>
