      This is a prospective, double blinded randomized, placebo-controlled study that will be&#xD;
      conducted on 112 adult ischemic or hemorrhagic hemiplegic stroke patients with calf muscles&#xD;
      spasticity so as to evaluate the effectiveness of radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (r&#xD;
      ESWT) as an additional treatment modality for spastic equinus deformity in those patients.&#xD;
      Allocation of patients into two groups after eligibility testing &amp; randomization will be&#xD;
      done:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: patients will receive rESWT once weekly for one month , Group II: patients will&#xD;
      receive Sham rESWT once weekly for one month. Each patient will be evaluated by the same well&#xD;
      trained physiatrist for clinical, Electrophysiological and Musculoskeletal Ultrasound (MSKUS)&#xD;
      assessments at baseline (t0), and after 1 month (t1) and after 2 months (t2) .&#xD;

      Study design &amp; Participants selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study that will be conducted from&#xD;
      October 2022 to March 2023, on 112 consecutive adult ischemic or hemorrhagic hemiplegic&#xD;
      stroke patients with calf muscles spasticity (grade 1 - 4) by the modified Ashworth scale&#xD;
      (MAS) who will be recruited from out patient clinic of Rheumatology , Rehabilitation and&#xD;
      Physical Medicine Department ,Tanta university Hospital, and will be assessed for study&#xD;
      eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who exhibited signs of unilateral spastic equinus foot for at least 6 months&#xD;
      before the enrollment in the study will be selected to reduce the confounding effect of&#xD;
      natural recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with fixed contractures or deformities at the ankle, fractures, cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, different types of neuropathies or myopathies, implanted pacemaker and prior /or&#xD;
      planned treatment using antispastic medications (i.e intrathecal baclofen or Botox injection&#xD;
      ) or chemo -denervation ( phenol or alcohol nerve blocks ) within the last 6 months preceding&#xD;
      the study , will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The closed envelop randomization method will be used for the randomization of the patients&#xD;
      who will be also blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be allocated into two groups after eligibility testing&amp; randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: will be exposed to rESWT once weekly for one month Group II: will be exposed to Sham&#xD;
      rESWT once weekly for one month. During the study period, oral anti-spastic medications and&#xD;
      stretching exercises will be similarly given for both groups. Tizanidine hydrochloride will&#xD;
      be the oral anti-spastic used at a daily dosage of 2 mg for first 4 days and then 4 mg until&#xD;
      the end of the follow up period. Stretching exercises will be included and given at 30&#xD;
      min/day, at 5 weekly sessions over the treatment period. Stretching exercises as well as&#xD;
      rESWT will be provided by the same blinded well-trained physiatrist and the patients in both&#xD;
      groups will not be allowed to change the dose of anti-spastic medication during the study&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The used assessment measures will be explained to all patients before having their written&#xD;
      informed consents to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data and results of the research will be used for scientific purposes with assurance of&#xD;
      patient privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation protocol and outcome measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be evaluated by the same well trained physiatrist for clinical,&#xD;
      Electrophysiological and Musculoskeletal Ultrasound (MSKUS) assessments at baseline (t0), and&#xD;
      after 1 month (t1) and after 2 months (t2) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Clinical assessment :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Plantar-flexor muscles spasticity: will be assessed by modified Ashworth scale (MAS). It&#xD;
           is a 5-point scale , ranging from ( 0 ) as normal muscle tone to (4 ) which is limb&#xD;
           rigid in flexion or extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Passive ankle dorsiflexion motion (PADFM) : of the affected side will be measured with a&#xD;
           goniometer while the patient is lying in a supine position with the knee flexed.. The&#xD;
           readings will be recorded and the mean score will be calculated. The degree of ankle&#xD;
           planter flexion will be measured as a negative value, and the degree of ankle&#xD;
           dorsiflexion will be measured as a positive value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The timed 10 meters walk test (10 MWT) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 10 Meter Walking Test (10 MWT) assesses short duration walking speed (m/s) &amp; measures the&#xD;
      time required to walk 10 meters. The time taken by the patients will be recorded by stopwatch&#xD;
      ,two consecutive trials will be done and the mean time will be calculated .&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Electrophysiological assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The H/M ratio (Ratio of maximum H reflex to maximum M response), will be assessed using&#xD;
      Electromyography machine (Neuroback ,Nihinon Kohden 4 channel. Japan 2008). The maximal&#xD;
      amplitude of H-reflex will be obtained with low intensity, with gradual increase of the&#xD;
      stimulus intensity, the M-response amplitude was gradually increased while the H-reflex&#xD;
      amplitude was gradually decreased . Two consecutive recording will be taken and the mean H/M&#xD;
      ratio will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Musculoskeletal ultrasound assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sonographic evaluation will be performed using a linear transducer scanning frequency of (&#xD;
      4-13 MHz) SAMSUNG MEDISON ( UGEO H 60) on the affected spastic calf muscles to qualify muscle&#xD;
      echo intensity using the Heckmatt scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (r ESWT ) protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (r ESWT) will be applied by Dornier AR2 machine&#xD;
      (Dornier MedTech GmbH, Wessling, Germany) under ultrasound guidance, at musculotendinous&#xD;
      junction of medial and lateral head of the gastrocnemius for spastic calf (gastrocnemius&#xD;
      muscle and the soleus) muscles . 1.500 pulses will be applied by an R20 probe with a focusing&#xD;
      depth of 4cm.The intensity will be 0.10 mJ to 0.3mJ/mm2 (2.5 bar), with frequency 4 Hz every&#xD;
      week for one month for the treatment group and without operating the machine for the sham&#xD;
      group . No anesthetic or analgesic drugs will be administered to patients during the therapy&#xD;
      session. Both groups will be put under the same physiotherapeutic program performed by the&#xD;
      same well-trained physiatrist .&#xD;
