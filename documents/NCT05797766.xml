    <textblock>
      Nonadherence to fluid restriction is a significant issue among hemodialysis patients&#xD;
      globally, with numerous adverse health outcomes. These outcomes include increased&#xD;
      intradialytic weight gain, acid-base and electrolyte imbalances, and decreased mental health.&#xD;
      This study aimed to determine the effects of a fluid distribution timetable on adherence to&#xD;
      fluid restriction among patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis. The&#xD;
      study utilized a single-blind, randomized-controlled efficacy trial design. Selected ESRD&#xD;
      patients undergoing hemodialysis are then randomized using computer-generated sequences of&#xD;
      randomly permuted blocks stratified according to sex to receive the intervention or the&#xD;
      control group. Adherence to fluid restriction was measured using the dialysis thirst&#xD;
      inventory and intradialytic weight gain. The variables were computed using One-way Repeated&#xD;
      Measures Multivariate Analysis of Variance and Multivariate Analysis of Covariance. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes included baseline patient demographic profile and was compared according to group&#xD;
      allocation. Both group were followed up for four weeks, assessing the outcome measures during&#xD;
      the third hemodialysis session for each week&#xD;

      Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), a condition wherein the kidney is damaged and cannot filter&#xD;
      blood properly (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2019), if&#xD;
      left untreated, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) otherwise known as kidney failure occurs. CKD&#xD;
      has been recognized as one of the major public health problems globally and has an estimated&#xD;
      prevalence of 13.4% of the total population and ESRD has an estimate between 4.902 million to&#xD;
      7.083 million cases. According to the CKD Health Policy Model, it is projected that there&#xD;
      would be an increase of 16.7% cases of CKD in adults in the year 2030.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodialysis is a maintenance management form of renal replacement therapy. It is a treatment&#xD;
      to filter the excess fluid and blood wastes by using a special filter that is considered as&#xD;
      an artificial kidney. However, hemodialysis alone is not a treatment for this disease, with&#xD;
      the help of fluid restriction and change of dietary prescription the quality of life of the&#xD;
      patient may significantly improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the perspective of hemodialysis patients, adherence to dietary regimens and fluid&#xD;
      restrictions is a great challenge due to the burden of constant choices about food and drink,&#xD;
      the adaptation to complex eating patterns, existing cultural practices, and the competing&#xD;
      demands of the chronic disease and comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to fluid restriction is a major problem among hemodialysis patients around the&#xD;
      world and persists to be a clinical concern in nephrology care. and a clinical problem in&#xD;
      nephrology care. Nonadherence to fluid restriction as defined by the National Kidney&#xD;
      Foundation is gaining an intradialytic weight of more than 5.7% of their weight post&#xD;
      hemodialysis session. Nonadherence to fluid restriction are found to have numerous&#xD;
      health-related problems, an increased intradialytic weight gain, acid-base and electrolyte&#xD;
      imbalances, and a decrease in mental health. Other than themselves, the hemodialysis patient&#xD;
      must also consider the burden of their home caregivers such as the management of family&#xD;
      costs, the maintenance of physical and psychological health, the provision of care, the&#xD;
      assumption of multiple roles, and the communication of expectations are challenges as a&#xD;
      caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-blind, single center, randomized-controlled trial that utilized data&#xD;
      collection triangulation to assess the efficacy and feasibility of a nursing intervention&#xD;
      that will promote treatment adherence to fluid restriction among hemodialysis patients in a&#xD;
      private tertiary level institution in Manila, Philippines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size computation using G*Power 3.1.7 showed that a sample size of 40 respondents is&#xD;
      necessary to achieve a power of 80%, attrition rate of 20%, partial Î·2 of 0.41, effect size&#xD;
      of 0.79 and significance level of 5% (two-tailed). A group allocation of 1:1 was used in five&#xD;
      data collection timeframes. The participating patients was allocated randomly into two&#xD;
      groups, the intervention, and the control group, using a computer-generated sequence of&#xD;
      random permuted blocks. The randomization was stratified according to the participants' sex&#xD;
      and was done by an independent statistician. The groupings was not be disclosed to the&#xD;
      participants and the unit's personnel in the duration of the study but was be disclosed once&#xD;
      the study is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon consenting, the participants were then divided into two groups using stratified,&#xD;
      permuted block randomization. The control group received standard care that consists of 10 to&#xD;
      15 minutes of face-to-face health teaching of their treatment regimen including management of&#xD;
      medication, vascular access, dietary and fluid, and hemodialysis schedule. The intervention&#xD;
      group received a combination of standard care and the intervention, the fluid distribution&#xD;
      timetable. The fluid distribution timetable is a scheduled distribution of predetermined&#xD;
      amounts of fluid intake daily depicted in a 5x6 table. The timetable has three major columns.&#xD;
      The first column has six-time points of a day with a four-hour interval. The second column,&#xD;
      which was divided into four sub-columns, reflects the percentage of fluid allotment for food,&#xD;
      activities, medication, and thirst encounters. The percentage of fluid allocation was&#xD;
      computed based on the patient's prescribed fluid restriction, usual time of food intake per&#xD;
      day, usual level of activity, time of medication intake, and common time they encounter&#xD;
      thirst for a day. The third column indicates the converted percentage of fluid allotment into&#xD;
      milliliters. The researcher shall provide a 210 ml glass for accuracy and uniformity of&#xD;
      measurement of fluid intake at home. The predetermined fluid restriction was determined by&#xD;
      the participant's nephrologist. The trained staff nurses was able to teach the intervention&#xD;
      to the participant and their primary care provider. The trained nurses answered any questions&#xD;
      and queries of the participant or the primary care provider until they understand the&#xD;
      intervention fully. If there are questions that the trained nurses cannot answer, the trained&#xD;
      staff nurse shall inform the researcher and be answered as soon as possible. The researcher&#xD;
      provided multiple copies of the fluid distribution table for each participant in the&#xD;
      intervention group. The participants was observed for one month and follow up with their&#xD;
      fluid distribution timetable every last day of their hemodialysis for the week and shall be&#xD;
      collected by the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prerecorded video used for training may also be used for the patient's queries and may&#xD;
      also be a guide at home. If the patient has difficulty in understanding the terms that the&#xD;
      intervention uses, the researcher may explain the intervention in layman's terms for better&#xD;
      understanding. If there is an existing language barrier, the researcher may explain the&#xD;
      intervention in the Filipino language. The veracity of the participants can be verified in&#xD;
      their intradialytic weight gain in between their previous hemodialysis weight gain and their&#xD;
      current pre-hemodialysis weight gain. To eliminate threats to internal validity, the&#xD;
      researcher randomized all consented participants upon acquiring informed consent and divided&#xD;
      them into two evenly distributed groups, the control and intervention group to eliminate&#xD;
      selection bias. The control group is formed to eliminate the threat to history and&#xD;
      maturation. To eliminate the threat to temporal ambiguity, the researcher gathered the data&#xD;
      of baseline thirst scores and interdialytic weight of all participants. In the event that the&#xD;
      participant is unable to attend their scheduled hemodialysis session, the researcher may&#xD;
      adjust their schedule as long as they have their hemodialysis three times per week and if&#xD;
      they fail to commit to this condition, the participant shall be removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence to fluid restriction was measured by utilizing two indicators, thirst and&#xD;
      intradialytic weight gain, and was compared using One-way Repeated Measures Multivariate&#xD;
      Analysis of Variance and Multivariate Analysis of Covariance. The thirst was measured using a&#xD;
      standardized tool, the dialysis thirst inventory, which was self reported by the&#xD;
      participants. The intradialytic weight weight gain was computed by determining the difference&#xD;
      of the current pre-hemodialysis session weight and the previous post hemodialysis weight.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes included the baseline demographic profile and were compared according to&#xD;
      treatment allocation. Both groups were followed up fort four weeks, assessing the outcome&#xD;
      measures on the third hemodialysis session of the week&#xD;
