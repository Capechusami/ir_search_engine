    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multicenter, parallel-group, open-label, randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial. Sepsis is defined as organ dysfunction induced by infections. And sepsis and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal injury can be the leading cause for each other. Our previous study showed&#xD;
      erector spinae plane block improved the organ dysfunctions in patients with AGI. The aim of&#xD;
      the clinical trial is to investigate erector pinae plane block improves the organ dysfunction&#xD;
      in septic patients with acute gastrointestinal injury.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants are assigned to two groups in parallel. All patients in both groups receive the same administration of acute gastrointestinal injury and enteral nutrition strategy according to the guidelines, and the routine practice of the ICU.For patients in the erector spinae plane block group, ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block is performed at thoracic (T) level 8. An 18F catheter is placed on both sides of the thoracic vertebra deep into the erector spinae, and a bolus of 20 ml of 0.375% ropivacaine is administered bilaterally. Then, a continuous infusion of 20 ml of 0.375% ropivacaine on each side is followed at a rate of 2 ml/h every 12 hours. The interventions end on day 7 or cease when the patients are discharged from the ICU, died, or withdrew their consent.</intervention_model_description>
