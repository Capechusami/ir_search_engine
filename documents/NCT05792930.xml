    <textblock>
      This research program is aimed to develop a integrative psychotherapy (including CBT and&#xD;
      biofeedback therapy) and to examine its efficacy on treatment of somatic symptom disorder.&#xD;
      The study design is a randomized controlled trial with waiting list control. Scores of&#xD;
      Patient Health Questionniare-15 and Health Anxiety Questionnaire are the primary endpoints.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is a psychiatric disorder featured with somatic distress and&#xD;
      related psychological phenomena. In the past several years, our research team has&#xD;
      investigated several aspects of SSD, including psychopathology, epidemiology, mechanism, and&#xD;
      diagnostic biomarkers. But the aspect about treatment on SSD has not been comprehensively&#xD;
      explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In literature, the treatment of SSD can be separated into physical and psychological&#xD;
      approaches. The physical approach includes pharmacotherapy and magnetic/electrical&#xD;
      neuromodulation. Among several types of psychotherapies, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      has the most evidence. Previous studies have disclosed SSD patients to have following&#xD;
      cognitive or behavioral features: selective attention on somatic distress; memory bias on the&#xD;
      severe health conditions; all-or-none cognition about health; organic attribution style;&#xD;
      catastrophizing cognitive pattern about health; high motivation of concerning issues about&#xD;
      health; inadequate reassurance-seeking behavior; the assumption about the connection between&#xD;
      rest and somatic distress, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biofeedback therapy works by measuring several biological signals related with stress and&#xD;
      relaxation (such as heart rate, skin conductance, electromyography, electroencephalography,&#xD;
      and finger temperature); feedback of these signals to the subjects can help them more clearly&#xD;
      understand the association between their behavior/cognition and relaxation. Biofeedback&#xD;
      therapy has been extensively applied in the psychosomatic field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research program is aimed to develop a integrative psychotherapy (including CBT and&#xD;
      biofeedback therapy) and to examine its efficacy. The study design is a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial with waiting list control. Scores of Patient Health Questionniare-15 (PHQ-15) and&#xD;
      Health Anxiety Questionnaire (HAQ) are the primary endpoints; the changes of other&#xD;
      psychological and biological measurements are viewed as secondary endpoints.&#xD;
