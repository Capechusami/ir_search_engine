    <textblock>
      CS5_3 aims to evaluate the tolerance and to adjust the mode of administration of 4 different&#xD;
      conditions of cryotherapy treatments applied on the brown spots of the face and hands with 3&#xD;
      prototypes. A brown spot is defined as solar or senile lentigo and post-inflammatory&#xD;
      hyperpigmentation (PIH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment corresponds to a combination of a specific sequence of a cryogenic spray and&#xD;
      of a frequency of application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate 3 prototypes :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prototype 1 : SN from (816-v1 001) to (816-v1 100)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prototype 2 : SN from (816-v1 101) to (816-v1 150)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prototype 3 : SN from (816-v1 151) to (816-v1 200)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prototypes will be applied on the face and hands according to specific frequencies of&#xD;
      application.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperpigmentation is a problem in all skin types. Safe depigmentation is a challenge.&#xD;
      Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen at -70 °C has been used in the treatment of solar skin&#xD;
      lesions for many years but causes considerable damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solar/senile lentigo is a harmless patch of darkened skin. It results from exposure to&#xD;
      ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which causes local proliferation of melanocytes and accumulation&#xD;
      of melanin within the skin cells (keratinocytes). Solar/senile lentigos or lentigines are&#xD;
      very common, especially in people over the age of 40 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A solar/senile lentigo is a flat, well-circumscribed patch. It can be round, oval or&#xD;
      irregular in shape. Colour varies from skin-coloured, tan to dark brown or black, and size&#xD;
      varies from a few millimetres to several centimetres in diameter. They can be slightly scaly.&#xD;
      Solar/senile lentigines are found as groups of similar lesions on sun-exposed sites,&#xD;
      particularly the face or the back of hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cryotherapy is more and more used to improve skin appearance and currently used to treat&#xD;
      lentigo spot. However, the cryogenic gas (conventional cryotherapy - liquid nitrogen) creates&#xD;
      a dermabrasion of the skin surface and person receiving this kind of treatment presents an&#xD;
      impaired skin during a few days following the treatment as temporary damage of stratum&#xD;
      corneum, erythema, scars, burns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the side effects occurring after conventional cryotherapy application, the Sponsor&#xD;
      has developed some devices using difluoroethane, manufactured by CRYONOVE PHARMA, already&#xD;
      available on the local and international markets, e.g. CRYOBEAUTY MAINS and CRYOBEAUTY CORPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To continue its research and development activities, the sponsor has selected other sequences&#xD;
      of a specific cryogenic spray (3 prototypes of devices for face and hands used according to&#xD;
      different frequencies of application, i.e. 4 conditions evaluated) which has been used&#xD;
      effectively and safely for lentigos treatment in Fitzpatrick phototypes I to IV on the face,&#xD;
      with benefit for the subjects without any adverse safety outcomes. There is therefore a need&#xD;
      to test the devices for lentigo and PIH on darker skin phototypes (V and VI according to&#xD;
      Fitzpatrick scale), which also encounter hyperpigmentation challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rational for this study is to obtain a proof of performance on a representative panel&#xD;
      sufficient to get statistically significant results of the expected effects. This will&#xD;
      complete the data obtained during the previous proof of performance studies already performed&#xD;
      on small panels as prerequisite data and have demonstrated an acceptable benefit/risk ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a proof of performance designed to be interventional, monocentric, randomized&#xD;
      and double blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application on the skin of the face and the hands for the prototypes (816-v1 001) to (816-v1&#xD;
      200).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each spot will be treated by a defined prototype (always the same prototype on the same&#xD;
           spot throughout the study) as given by a randomization list.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each spot will be treated 6 times during the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At D0, D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5) (condition 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At D0, D7, D14, D21, D28 and D35 (condition 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At D0, D14, D28, D42, D56 and D70 (conditions 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At D0, D14, D28, D42, D56 and D70 (conditions 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distribution of the spots per phototypes and per condition is the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before any application, the dermatologist will collect the adverse events if any and&#xD;
           will decide if the period between two consecutive applications should be extended or&#xD;
           not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the application, the dermatologist will verify that the skin has not been treated&#xD;
           by cosmetic products (no presence of cream that could interfere with the treatment) and&#xD;
           is dry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration by the responsible technician (previously trained).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discontinuation of the treatment after the disappearance of the spot (to be confirmed by&#xD;
           Dermatologist).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be lying supine, and the prototypes will be administered upside down for&#xD;
           the applications on the face and sitting for the applications on the hands. For the&#xD;
           application on the hands, the hands will be placed flat on the table and the prototypes&#xD;
           will be applied upside down.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During applications on the face, subjects will wear safety goggles protecting the eyes&#xD;
           from cryogenic gas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  From the start of the study until 2 months after the last treatment, volunteers will&#xD;
           apply a sunscreen SPF 50+ (La Roche Posay, Anthelios if available to their hands and&#xD;
           face in case of sun exposure). In case of prolonged sun exposure, application will be&#xD;
           repeated as defined in the instructions for use.&#xD;
