  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, many studies have focused on the characteristics of PID in children, allowing to&#xD;
      highlight an entry into the disease in the context of more or less severe infections in all&#xD;
      pediatric departments. However, only one study has so far studied the frequency of these PID&#xD;
      in a pediatric resuscitation unit, which is why we propose this study to the Caen University&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigtors propose a two-step study, both retrospective and prospective, in order to&#xD;
      increase our cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrospective analysis of the data will be done over the period 2013-2016, the&#xD;
      prospective analysis will be done from May 2017 to January 2018. The study will be&#xD;
      monocentric, performed in the pediatric resuscitation department of the University Hospital&#xD;
      of Caen to evaluate the prevalence of PIDs and describe their characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The included patients will be aged 0 to 18 years, hospitalized in the pediatric intensive&#xD;
      care unit for a serious infection and / or of an unfavorable evolution, or an opportunistic&#xD;
      germ infection in the absence of a DIP or an immunodeficiency previously known. The inclusion&#xD;
      will be proposed by the intensive care pediatricians. Authorization by the legal&#xD;
      representative will be required in advance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected during the systematic consultation in pediatric&#xD;
      haemato-immuno-oncology within 3 months after their hospitalization in intensive care unit to&#xD;
      detect a DIP by a thorough interrogation, a clinical examination and a first-line biological&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second consultation will be scheduled in the 3 months following the 1st with announcement&#xD;
      of the results of the first balance sheet and completion of a second complementary balance&#xD;
      sheet if a suspicion of DIP persists at the end of the first balance sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The precise description of the incidence of these immunodeficiencies and their&#xD;
      characteristics could lead to the development of recommendations on the routine screening of&#xD;
      PID in pediatric resuscitation; an early diagnosis enabling preventive and curative&#xD;
      management (vaccine, immunoglobulin, antibiotic prophylaxis, etc.) to be put in place in&#xD;
      order to limit the risk of infectious recurrence and reduce the morbidity.&#xD;
