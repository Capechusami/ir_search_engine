  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of erector spinae plane block (ESPB) and&#xD;
      Retrolaminar Block on postoperative recovary quality and pain after lumbar spinal surgery&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed as a double-blind, prospective randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blindness; The healthcare professionals who will monitor the patient's pain in the&#xD;
      post-operative period will not know which of the ESP or RLB block is applied. Randomization&#xD;
      of the patients was planned using computer aided. It was envisaged to include 40 participants&#xD;
      each in the ESP block and RLB block groups. The current pain status of the patients in the&#xD;
      ESP block and RLB block groups in the postoperative period was determined by NRS (Numerical&#xD;
      rating scale) at rest and motion at certain hour intervals (30 .min,1.,6.,12.,24. hours) will&#xD;
      be done, when the patients' NRS scores are 4 and above, an additional intravenous analgesic&#xD;
      will be administered and the number of bolus doses with PCA in the first 24 hours will be&#xD;
      recorded. The recovery quality of the patients who underwent both ESP block and RLB block at&#xD;
      the postoperative 24th hour will be evaluated with a (QoR-40) scoring system. In addition,&#xD;
      the hemodynamic values of the patients will be recorded in these intervals.&#xD;

    <description>After anesthesia and surgical intervention, bilateral ESP passage will be performed with ultrasonography from the T10 level 3 cm lateral to the midline. After cleaning the area with povidone iodine before the block, T10 transverse output will be determined using a linear ultrasound probe. Local anesthetic will be applied to the erector spina with the use of the needle used for peripheral block procedures and transverse access. With the serum treatment from the local anesthesia application, the location of the needle will be correct with the hydrodissection method. After the location of the needle is confirmed, a mixture containing 20 ml of LA and serum will be applied and the same procedure will be repeated in the contralateral. 20 ml of total 40 ml LA is bupivacaine 0.5%, after 20 ml serum content.</description>

    <description>The patient is in the prone position and the high-frequency linear ultrasound transducer is in parasagittal orientation, but the entry point is determined more medial than the ESP block. The needle entry point is 1-1.5 cm lateral to the targeted spinos process. The echogenic needle is advanced until it contacts the lamina in the craniocaudal plane and 0.5-1 for control. By giving cc 0.9 nacl solution, it is observed that the fluid is distributed between the erector spina muscle and the lamina. After the location of the needle is confirmed, a mixture of 20 ml of LA and saline will be applied and the same procedure will be repeated in the contralateral. 20 ml of total 40 ml LA will consist of bupivacaine 0.5% and 20 ml physiological saline.</description>
