  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional spinal deformity usually&#xD;
      associated with intervertebral rotation that takes place during adolescence. Generally,&#xD;
      bracing treatment is a common option for scoliosis patients. Non-surgical treatment for&#xD;
      scoliosis patients is to offer a conservative solution to treat their condition and encourage&#xD;
      a higher degree of compliance by avoiding interference with their daily life activities.&#xD;
      Therefore, intelligent nighttime braces have been developed to solve this issue, which are&#xD;
      intended to be worn for inhibiting the advancement of spinal deformity during sleeping hours.&#xD;
      However, its efficacy is still controversial. Intelligent nighttime brace with a specialized&#xD;
      design for teenagers with scoliosis is limited and most part of them are lack of mobility and&#xD;
      lack of control over corrective forces on particular regions of the vertebra. A scientific&#xD;
      approach should be used to design and develop intelligent nighttime brace as a treatment&#xD;
      option for adolescents with early scoliosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design of intelligent nighttime brace with smart padding for adolescent idiopathic&#xD;
      scoliosis will incorporate different mechanisms, such as&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. compression and pulling forces through a customizable rigid brace&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. lumbar flexion by using a supporting air-belt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. three-point pressure system is used to exert corrective forces by the intelligent&#xD;
           paddings in the transverse direction&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. adjust the pressure of the brace padding through a pressure monitoring system in&#xD;
           accordance with the sleeping posture of the users&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be invited to undergo a fitting session of intelligent nighttime brace. After the fitting, participants will join a 6-month wear trial of the intelligent nighttime brace. Participants are required to wear the intelligent nighttime brace for 8 hours a day during sleeping and compliance will be recorded by an intelligent monitoring system. Participants will be invited to undergo assessments before the wear trial, after the trials of 3 months and after the trial of 6 months. The measure outcomes of the assessment include 1)ultrasound scanning image, 2)3D body scanning, 3)garment pressure, 4) questionnaires</description>
