  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is characterized by physical, emotional, and behavioral symptoms&#xD;
      in the luteal phase that significantly disrupt women's daily lives, including work and&#xD;
      personal activities, and resolve spontaneously within a few days of the onset of&#xD;
      menstruation. The premenstrual syndrome causes emotional eating, excessive consumption of&#xD;
      certain foods, and increased appetite. These unhealthy eating patterns in eating behavior&#xD;
      affect health negatively. Women with PMS have an increased appetite and food cravings. It has&#xD;
      been stated that the increase in appetite and food cravings are reduced by laughter therapy.&#xD;
      Thus, the laughter therapy method, which has no side effects in PMS and negative eating&#xD;
      behaviors, can be used and recommended or applied by health professionals.&#xD;

      The universe of the research will be all young women with PMS who study at the designated&#xD;
      Faculty of Health Sciences in the Spring semester of the 2022-2023 academic year. The sample&#xD;
      of the study will be all young women studying at the Faculty of Health Sciences, meeting the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and agreeing to participate in the study. All young women with a&#xD;
      Premenstrual Syndrome Diagnostic Scale total score of 43 and above will be included in the&#xD;
      study. Since all women who have a Premenstrual Syndrome Diagnostic Scale of 43 and above,&#xD;
      volunteer to participate in the study, and meet the inclusion criteria will be included in&#xD;
      the study, no additional sample selection will be made. The application and control group&#xD;
      will be determined on random.org among the group that constitutes the sample of the study.&#xD;
      Laughter therapy sessions will be applied online for 25-30 minutes once a week for 2 months&#xD;
      by the researcher who has the Laughter therapy certificate to the application group. At the&#xD;
      end of two months, the Personal Information Form, Premenstrual Syndrome Diagnostic Scale, and&#xD;
      the Food Craving Scale will be administered again to both the application group and the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;

    <description>It was developed by Yıldırım Gürkan (2022) in accordance with DSM V criteria. The Premenstrual Symptoms Diagnostic Scale consists of 30 items and provides a 4-point Likert scale; It has five sub-dimensions: &quot;Physical Status&quot;, &quot;Cognitive Perception and Sleep Status&quot;, &quot;Work and Social Life Status&quot; and &quot;Nutrition Status&quot;. There is no reverse coded expression in the measurement tool. The lowest 30 and the highest 120 points are obtained from the scale. Those who score between 30-42 are diagnosed as healthy, those with scores between 43-81 are diagnosed with PMS, and those with scores between 82-120 are diagnosed as PDD (Premenstrual Dysphroric Disorder).</description>

    <description>The scale was developed by Cepeda-Benito et al. (2000) Akkurt et al. (2019) Turkish validity and reliability were performed. The scale consists of 39 items and is evaluated in a 6-point Likert type. The scale has 9 sub-dimensions. Sub-dimensions and items in sub-dimensions are as follows. &quot;Having Intentions and Plans to Consume Food&quot;, &quot;Anticipation of Positive Reinforcement Feelings As a Result of Eating&quot;, &quot;Lack of Eating Control Over Eating&quot;, &quot;Thoughts or Preoccupation with Food Cravings or Eating&quot;, &quot;Craving as a Physiological State&quot;, &quot;Emotions That May Be Experienced Before or During Meal&quot;, &quot;Cues That May Trigger Food Craving&quot;, &quot;Guilt From Cravings and/or for Giving Into Them&quot;. The score of each sub-dimension and scale is obtained by dividing the total item scores by the number of items. The scores obtained in this way express the high desire to eat in the scale and in the sub-dimensions.</description>
