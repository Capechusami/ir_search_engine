    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of different modalities of aquatic&#xD;
      physiotherapy on the biochemical and functional behavior of patients with knee's&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis.&#xD;

      The subjects will be informed about the study and its potentials risks and sign the informed&#xD;
      consent. The sample will be submitted to three different modalities of AF interventions: (a)&#xD;
      low impact immersion, (b) conventional aquatic physiotherapy and (c) high intensity aquatic&#xD;
      physiotherapy. The functional variables of flexibility, pain, joint volume will be evaluated&#xD;
      before and immediately after each intervention whereas the biochemical variables will be&#xD;
      evaluated from the analysis of peripheral blood following times: baseline moment (immediately&#xD;
      before the intervention), moment 1 (immediately after the intervention), and moment 2 (24&#xD;
      hours after the intervention).&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Low impact immersion</intervention_name>
    <description>Consists of a sequence of shoulder, trunk and hip movements. In this modality, the aim will be to understand the physiological effects of immersion in heat water. Resisted movements (either by turbulence or by floats) or interventional maneuvers in the knee joints will not be performed. Considering the period of 5 minutes for acclimatization to the liquid environment, the program will last approximately 47 minutes.</description>

    <description>include warm-up, strengthening and calming down activities. Aquatic steppes will be used to ensure that all participants will maintain the waterline level approximately in the xiphoid appendix. For strengthening activities, the exercises must be performed at an adequate speed, which ensures a comfortable level for the activity. For this purpose, a subjective feedback will be extracted from the participants constantly. The warm-up sequence consists of six different active hip and knee movements performed at maximum range of motion and contributes to neuromuscular activation. For strengthening, each movement should be performed for 1 minute (30 seconds for each lower limb) followed by a period of 30 seconds of rest between each movement.</description>

    <description>In this modality subjects will perform the same sequence of exercises of the Conventional Aquatic Physiotherapy program will be respected. However the work load and speed will be adjusted to the maximum level. For strengthening, each movement should be performed for 2 minutes (1 minute for each lower limb) followed by a period of 30 seconds of rest between each movement. To guarantee the maximum effort of the participants, verbal stimuli will be constantly provided. The program will last approximately 68 minutes.</description>
