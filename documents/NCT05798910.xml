    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is to reveal whether virtual reality(VR) based Advanced Life&#xD;
      Support(ALS) serious game module can replace classroom-based ALS lecture, which is part of&#xD;
      existing ALS training protocol in addition to skills training.&#xD;

      The participants consisting of students from Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University&#xD;
      Vocational School for Anesthesiology (N=29) were randomly divided into two groups with 15&#xD;
      (Conventional training group) and 14 (VR based training group) participants each. The members&#xD;
      of the conventional group had to complete pretest at the beginning of the study. Afterwards&#xD;
      they had to take part at an interactive classroom based lecture about ALS. The next step was&#xD;
      the skills training with task trainers in order to teach them compression skills. Afterwards,&#xD;
      the conventional group was divided into three blue code teams consisting of each 5&#xD;
      participants for the simulation session. Two independent instructors evaluated the video&#xD;
      recordings in terms of technical and nontechnical skills. The final stage of the study were&#xD;
      completing the post-test. The members of VR group had a similar study flow but they had to&#xD;
      play with the VR based ALS serious game module instead of the theoretical lecture during the&#xD;
      study flow. A survey about preference of VR based trainings was conducted for the members of&#xD;
      the VR group. Mann Whitney U Test and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test were used for statistical&#xD;
      analysis of the two groups' performances in this study.&#xD;

    <measure>Providing theoretical knowledge about Advanced Life Support Protocol by using VR based serious game module and classroom based theoretical lecture.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>In the beginning of the study, the participants of the two groups (VR Group and Conventional Training Group) have answered the questions of the pretest. Afterwards, one group had VR based training and the other group had classroom based training. After completing the posttest at the end of the study, the pretest and posttest results were evaluated in order to compare the effectivity of VR based training and classroom based training. The maximum score that could be earned from the pretest and posttest 100.</description>

    <description>Depending on the comparison of the pretest and posttest results, the participants, who were trained with VR based serious gaming module has similar results compared with the participants, who were trained with a classroom based lecture. The potential of VR based ALS trainings to replace classroom based lecture to provide ALS knowledge was investigated.</description>

    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of the study, the participants of the VR group were asked to fill a survey about their VR experience during the study. The survey for the VR group also revealed that the majority participants would prefer VR based ALS serious gaming module instead of lecture-based educations in the classroom. A five point Likert scale was used in the survey to evaluate the answers of the participants..</description>
