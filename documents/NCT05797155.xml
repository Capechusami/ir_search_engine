  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study aims to develop a cognitive dissonance-based mobile app for smoking&#xD;
      cessation (CoQuit) and test the efficacy of the app with 500 adult smokers who express a&#xD;
      desire to quit smoking.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research project will evaluate the CoQuit mobile app for smoking cessation by having 500&#xD;
      daily adult smokers recruited through social media and randomized to either the CoQuit app or&#xD;
      an app that has similar content but no tasks for inducing cognitive dissonance among&#xD;
      participants. Outcomes will be measured at 1- and 3-months post-baseline and will include&#xD;
      quit attempts, number of days without smoking (smokefree days), and changes in smoking&#xD;
      attitudes and behavior, and smoking abstinence. Usability data, system log data on program&#xD;
      use, and participant satisfaction data will also be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers hypothesize that individuals using the cognitive dissonance intervention&#xD;
      (CDI) will show greater increases in quit attempts, smoke free days, quit rates, and positive&#xD;
      smoking attitudes and behaviors than individuals in the active comparison condition. The&#xD;
      researchers will test whether gender, smoking dependence, readiness to quit, previous quit&#xD;
      attempts, age of smoking initiation, and socio-economic status moderate intervention effects&#xD;
      on smoking outcomes.&#xD;

    <measure>Fagerstrom Tobacco Dependence Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month, 3-month</time_frame>
    <description>Change in nicotine dependence from baseline to 3 months. This is a 6 item measure. Total scores range from 0 to 10 points with higher scores indicating higher levels of dependence.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Contemplation Ladder</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month, 3-month</time_frame>
    <description>Change in motivation to quit smoking. This measure is a single ten point scale arranged as a ladder with descriptions of readiness to quit for 5 levels; higher scores indicate higher readiness to quit.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Dissonance Thermometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month, 3-month</time_frame>
    <description>Change in cognitive dissonance will be assessed using the Dissonance Thermometer, which measures participants' experience of 14 different feelings (e.g., embarrassed, optimistic) related to particular stimuli. Higher scores indicate higher levels of cognitive dissonance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Program Engagement</measure>
    <time_frame>1-month, 3-month</time_frame>
    <description>This measure will assess usage of CoQuit app.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Consumer Satisfaction and Program Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>3-month</time_frame>
    <description>The measure will assess the perceived ease of using the app and perceived benefit of the app. Some items will use a 7 point Likert scale to assess satisfaction with the mobile app and usability function of the app.</description>
