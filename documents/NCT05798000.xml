      A prospective multicenter study was conducted in 6 large Ukrainian hospitals: Kyiv City&#xD;
      Clinical Hospitals #1, University Clinic of the Bogomolets National Medical University, Kyiv&#xD;
      City Maternity Hospital #5, National Cancer Institute, Shalimov National Institute of Surgery&#xD;
      and Transplantology, Saint Martin Hospital in Mukachevo. Institutions were selected among&#xD;
      those, where surgical department administration was willing to implement the Safe Surgery&#xD;
      Saves Lives campaign recommendations, but has not yet formally introduced the WHO Safe&#xD;
      Surgery Checklist. On each study site, 1 or 2 operating rooms were designated for data&#xD;
      collection. All surgical procedures observed by the data collectors in those operating rooms&#xD;
      were included. The study was conducted in two phases: control period, lasting from February&#xD;
      1, 2022 until August 1, 2022, followed by a week-long educational period during which the WHO&#xD;
      Surgical Safety Checklist and the Anesthesia Equipment Checklist were used but no data were&#xD;
      collected. The intervention period began on August 8, 2022 and lasted until December 31,&#xD;
      2022. Hospital administration and members of all surgical teams were informed of the nature&#xD;
      of the study and the proper checklist use method by the involved anesthesiologists, who were&#xD;
      previously instructed by the primary investigators. WHO Surgical Safety Checklists and the&#xD;
      Anesthesia Equipment Checklists were provided in the designated operating rooms. Both&#xD;
      checklists were translated into Ukrainian. The requirement for written informed consent from&#xD;
      the patient was waived by the ethical committee of Bogomolets National Medical University.&#xD;
      The study design was approved by the ethics committee of the Bogomolets National Medical&#xD;
      University (protocol #148, 07.09.2021).&#xD;
