  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify the safety and efficacy of the cardiac pulse ablation&#xD;
      system in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to provide the basis for product registration and&#xD;
      clinical application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted at a clinical center with appropriate clinical cases, and&#xD;
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ablation procedures will be performed by an authorized&#xD;
      investigator using the trial product. The effectiveness and safety of the cardiac pulse&#xD;
      ablation system in the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation will be verified by&#xD;
      collecting the treatment success rate, immediate ablation success rate, procedure time and&#xD;
      device use evaluation within 12 months after the procedure.&#xD;

    <description>This trial is a prospective, multicenter, single-group target value method study. All subjects are treated uniformly with the pulse ablation system provided in this protocol for paroxysmal AF, and the test results for the main indicators are statistically compared with the target values, a widely accepted standard in professional medicine, and the test results are considered to be attained if the one-sided 95% confidence interval for the test results is not lower than the target values.</description>
