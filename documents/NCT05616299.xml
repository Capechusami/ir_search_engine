  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants are being asked to participate in this study because they are having an epidural&#xD;
      placed for labor. This human clinical trial has been designed to evaluate the use of the&#xD;
      BrightPoint Reflectometer Device (AKA BrightPoint device) as secondary confirmation of Loss&#xD;
      of Residence (LOR) for lumbar epidural placement by an experienced clinician. For this study,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to receive an epidural by an experienced clinician either&#xD;
      with or without the use of the BrightPoint device. Epidurals performed as a part of this&#xD;
      study will be done in a manner similar to how epidurals are currently performed in the&#xD;
      hospital. The epidural space will be entered using usual loss of resistance technique for all&#xD;
      patients. If the BrightPoint device is used, it will be as secondary verification of entry&#xD;
      into the epidural space.&#xD;
