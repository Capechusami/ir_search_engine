  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of pain on cognitive performance have not been thoroughly investigated. Broadly,&#xD;
      the purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of acute pain on performance of a&#xD;
      variety of cognitive performance measures. The investigators hypothesize that acute pain&#xD;
      impairs cognitive performance, particularly cognitive measures of working memory, attention,&#xD;
      and processing speed.&#xD;
