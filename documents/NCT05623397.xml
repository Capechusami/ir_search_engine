  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Deep-learning&quot; is a fast-growing method of machine learning (artificial intelligence, AI)&#xD;
      which is arousing the interest of the scientific committee in many medical fields. These&#xD;
      methods make it possible to generate matches between raw inputs (such as the digital signal&#xD;
      from the ECG) and the desired outputs (for example, the measurement of QTc). Unlike&#xD;
      traditional machine learning methods, which require manual extraction of structured and&#xD;
      predefined data from raw input, deep-learning methods learn these functionalities directly&#xD;
      from raw data, without pre-defined guidelines. With the advent of big-data and the recent&#xD;
      exponential increase in computing power, these methods can produce models with exceptional&#xD;
      performance. The investigators recently used this type of method using multi-layered&#xD;
      artificial neural networks, to create an application based on a model that directly&#xD;
      transforms the raw digital data of ECGs (.xml) into a measure of QTc comparable to those&#xD;
      respecting the highest standards concerning reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this trial is to study the performance of our DL-AI model for QTc&#xD;
      measurement (vs. best standards of QTc measurements, TCM) applied to the recommended ECG&#xD;
      monitoring following ribociclib prescription for breast cancer patients in routine clinical&#xD;
      care. The investigators will acquire ECG with diverse devices including simplified devices&#xD;
      (one/three lead acquisition, low frequency sampling rate: 125-500 Htz) to determine if&#xD;
      they'll be equally performant versus 12-lead acquisition machine to evaluate QTc in this&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
