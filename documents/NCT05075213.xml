  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of QuitBet, a digital contingency&#xD;
      management program for smoking cessation. QuitBet combines social gaming elements with&#xD;
      participant-funded financial incentives in the form of a deposit contract. QuitBet &quot;players&quot;&#xD;
      deposit (called the &quot;bet&quot;) a specified amount of their own money into the game's &quot;pot.&quot; All&#xD;
      &quot;winners&quot; who achieve the game's goal split the pot equally, such that their bet is fully&#xD;
      refunded plus they receive extra money from the forfeited bets of players who did not meet&#xD;
      the goal. Participants (N = 550) will be randomly assigned to QuitBet or QuitBet-NS (deposit&#xD;
      contract only, no social elements). All participants will be offered a second game after&#xD;
      their first game (up to 8 weeks total game duration) and will be asked to complete a survey&#xD;
      after each game and at 1 and 4 months after the end of the second game (3 and 6 months after&#xD;
      the start of their first game). The study will compare QuitBet vs. QuitBet-NS on smoking&#xD;
      behavior outcomes and examine potential mediators of outcomes such as motivation, engagement,&#xD;
      and satisfaction.&#xD;

    <description>QuitBet is a quit smoking game delivered via a smartphone application that lasts 28 days and includes contingency management in the form of a deposit contract, integrated exhaled breath carbon monoxide (CO) testing, a social feed on which &quot;players&quot; can post and respond to messages, and a &quot;leaderboard&quot; that displays players' status (i.e., whether they are still eligible to win). A game host will post educational information about smoking cessation and serve as a discussion moderator. Participants will deposit (&quot;bet&quot;) $30 of their own money at the start of the game. Participants who submit a CO test that is 6ppm or lower (indicating no smoking) on at least 24 of the 26 days between day 3-28 will be declared winners and will split the pot of money that was deposited. All participants who submit at least 21 CO tests during the 28 day game, regardless of the CO test result, will be entered into a lottery to win a prize worth $75.</description>

    <description>QuitBet-NS will include the deposit contract and integrated CO testing with identical rules to QuitBet for being a winner, the $75 raffle for submitting at least 21 CO tests, a display of the participant's daily CO test results that is updated in real time, and a game feed on which only the game host has the ability to post. Players will not be able to post on this feed or respond to the host's posts. At the beginning of the game, the host will post limited information, including a list of smoking cessation resources. QuitBet-NS will NOT include the social feed, leaderboard, or any other social features.</description>
