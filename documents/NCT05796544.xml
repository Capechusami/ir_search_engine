  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether remote education is as effective as&#xD;
      in-person education in improving self-care behaviors of ostomy patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After signing the informed consent form, patients with ostomy will be assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention or active control group (1:1). The intervention group will receive a total of&#xD;
      four remote educational sessions over 2 months. The control group will receive the standard&#xD;
      care, consisting of in-person standard education.&#xD;
