  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young adult cancer survivors (18-39y) are at increased risk of financial distress. This study&#xD;
      seeks to better understand the financial challenges experienced by these individuals via&#xD;
      quantitative serial assessments, study-based financial navigator encounters and an end of&#xD;
      study qualitative interview.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This fully remote, multi-site study will evaluate the role of financial navigators in&#xD;
      relieving financial distress in young adults (18-39y) who have completed treatment for blood&#xD;
      cancer at least three years ago. Serial Assessments at study entry, 3-months, and 6-months&#xD;
      measure financial distress measured using the study's primary outcome measure the Personal&#xD;
      Financial Wellness Scaleâ„¢ (PFW) (see below), hypothesized effect modifiers (emotional&#xD;
      distress, self-efficacy, cognitive functioning), as well as care seeking, household finances&#xD;
      and insurance characteristics. Randomization will occur following completion of baseline&#xD;
      measures (see below for description of study arms). In addition to a formal evaluation of the&#xD;
      intervention at 3- and 6-months, an optional interview will occur following the 6-month&#xD;
      assessment/navigation intervention period to gain further insight from participants about the&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention. For ethical considerations related to the topic of study,&#xD;
      all participants will be provided with the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's information&#xD;
      specialist hotline.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate the change in financial distress associated with randomization group assignment from baseline to 6-month follow up as measured by the 8-item Personal Financial Wellness Scale (PFW).

    <description>As part of Aim 1, we will explore whether changes in financial distress (baseline to 6-months) are moderated by emotional distress, self-efficacy, and cognitive functioning, as measured by Patient-Reported Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 4-item short forms for emotions distress (depression and anxiety) and self-efficacy, as well as the 4-item cognitive functioning scale from the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-Qol) battery. For each of these short forms, high scores connote better functioning.</description>
