    <textblock>
      This research is a randomized controlled experimental study to evaluate the effects of PMR&#xD;
      application based on HBM in terms of blood sugar and anxiety levels in women with GDM. 34&#xD;
      pregnant women who applied PMR formed the &quot;intervention group&quot; and 34 pregnant women who did&#xD;
      not practice PMR formed the &quot;control group&quot;. The intervention group received &quot;Progressive&#xD;
      Muscle Relaxation Training&quot;. It was determined that there was a statistically significant&#xD;
      difference between the last follow-up state anxiety score averages, and the intermediate and&#xD;
      final follow-up trait anxiety scores between the intervention and control groups. It was&#xD;
      determined that PMR provided a decrease in psychological anxiety levels in pregnant women&#xD;
      with GDM, and did not have a positive effect on physiologically fasting, 1 hour postprandial&#xD;
      and 2 hour postprandial blood glucose levels. PMR training prepared based on HBM is a method&#xD;
      that nurses can perform independently to ensure the psychological well-being of pregnant&#xD;
      women with GDM.&#xD;

      Aim: This research is a randomized controlled experimental study that includes evaluation of&#xD;
      the effects of PMR based on the SIM model in terms of blood sugar and anxiety levels in women&#xD;
      with GDM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The sample group consisted of 68 pregnant women who were diagnosed with GDM for the&#xD;
      first time in the Health Sciences University Antalya Training and Research Hospital&#xD;
      Gynecology and Obstetrics Polyclinic. 34 pregnant women who applied PMR constituted the&#xD;
      &quot;intervention group&quot; and 34 pregnant women who did not practice PMR constituted the &quot;control&#xD;
      group&quot;. Data collection was done by the researcher. The &quot;Informed Consent Form&quot;, &quot;Pregnant&#xD;
      Diagnosis Form&quot;, &quot;State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-STAI&quot; were applied to women with GDM in the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups before the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progressive Muscle Relaxation Training was given to the intervention group. Pregnant women in&#xD;
      the intervention group applied PMR 1 hour after dinner, 5 days a week, for 8 weeks. The&#xD;
      &quot;International Physical Activity Questionnaire-IPAQ&quot; and &quot;Diet Compliance Questionnaire&quot; were&#xD;
      applied to both groups every week for eight weeks.The &quot;State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-STAI&quot;&#xD;
      was administered to both groups for interim follow-up 4 weeks after the intervention, and the&#xD;
      postprandial 1st hour and 2nd hour postprandial blood glucose values were measured.The&#xD;
      &quot;State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-STAI&quot; was administered to both groups for the final follow-up,&#xD;
      8 weeks after the intervention, and the postprandial 1st hour and 2nd hour postprandial blood&#xD;
      glucose values were measured.The data in the research were analyzed using the IBM SPSS&#xD;
      (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) for Windows 25.0 program.&#xD;

    <description>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory is a Likert-type scale consisting of 20 questions that measures state and trait anxiety levels separately. There are two kinds of expressions in the scales. These are called direct and reverse expressions. Direct expressions, negative emotions; reversed expressions express positive emotions. The scores obtained from both scales separately vary between 20 and 80. A large score indicates a high level of anxiety, and a small score indicates a low level of anxiety.</description>

    <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) Short Form. The IPAQ consists of a total of seven questions questioning short form walking, moderate-intensity physical activity, vigorous physical activity, and time spent sitting. Total score calculation, metabolic equation (MET) values given to activities (vigorous activity=8 METs, moderate-intensity activity=4 METs, walking=3.3 METs, sitting-=1.5 METs), duration (minutes) and frequency of activities (number of days) multiplied and weekly MET-min scores are obtained. Physical activity levels according to total physical activity score; Those with 0-600 MET-minutes/week are classified as physically inactive, those with 600-3000 MET-minutes/week with low physical activity level, those with over 3000 MET-minutes/week as having adequate physical activity level.</description>
