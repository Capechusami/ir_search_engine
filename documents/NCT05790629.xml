      Randomized Clinical Trial using Three Dimensional Evaluation of Apexogensis of immature young&#xD;
      permanent teeth with Different Endodontic Tri-calcium Silicate-Based Putties&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of immature permanent teeth has always been challenging in endodontics, not only&#xD;
      because of their wide-open root apices but also because of the thin underdeveloped dentinal&#xD;
      walls.Apexogenesis falls under the category of vital pulp therapy (VPT) procedure to maintain&#xD;
      pulp vitality, induce dentin bridge formation and encourage continued root maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome the drawbacks of tricalcium silicate-based cements, a range of bioactive&#xD;
      endodontic cements have been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EndoSequence BC RRM-Fast Set Putty and NeoPutty (NuSmile, Houston, TX, USA) are the two&#xD;
      materials evaluated in this study.&#xD;

    <description>Positive response to sensibility testing. it evaluates the condition of the Pulp Being Very Responsive to a hot and cold Stimulus The pulp is deemed normal when there is a response to the stimulus. Pulpitis is present when there is an exaggerated response that produces pain. The absence of responses to sensibility tests is usually associated with the likelihood of pulp necrosis, the tooth is pulpless,</description>

    <description>young permanent pulpy exposed carious tooth of the selected participants will be treated with specific technique called apexogenesis using bio-compatible material (endo-sequence putty ). This material is administrated to the tooth by placing about 2-4 mm bulk of material in the pulp champers at the cervical line then sealing the capping material with glass ionomer and stainless steel crown.</description>
