      Research shows that exercising at home can improve arm and hand movement after a stroke.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, it can be hard to exercise enough to make a difference in arm and hand&#xD;
      movement after stroke. In this study, the investigators will try to determine things that&#xD;
      make it easy or hard for Veterans to exercise their arm and hand after a stroke. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators will recruit Veteran stroke survivors who have difficulty using&#xD;
      their arm and hand after a stroke. First, the investigators will administer surveys and&#xD;
      questionnaires to get Veteran stroke survivors' perspectives on their self-confidence, mood,&#xD;
      sleep, and more. Then, the investigators will ask them to track their home exercise using a&#xD;
      wearable movement tracker (like a smart watch). Then, Veteran stroke survivors will meet with&#xD;
      a researcher to talk about their experience doing home exercise and why they think it was&#xD;
      easy or hard to do.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke affects nearly 800,000 people in the United States annually. Around 15,000 Veterans&#xD;
      are admitted to Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities per year with stroke, and Veterans attend&#xD;
      approximately 60,000 outpatient visits for stroke each year. Upper extremity (UE) impairment&#xD;
      is a common consequence of stroke that requires ongoing outpatient visits for treatment. UE&#xD;
      impairment reduces individuals' ability to perform activities for self-care, employment, and&#xD;
      recreation, thereby diminishing independence and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extensive repetitions of UE activity improve functional recovery of the UE post-stroke.&#xD;
      However, the high amount of UE activity necessary for neuroplasticity and functional recovery&#xD;
      is not achieved within typical therapy sessions. To circumvent limited time with a therapist,&#xD;
      a home exercise program (HEP) is commonly prescribed. Unfortunately, patient adherence to HEP&#xD;
      is known to be low,16-19 resulting in poor motor recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral interventions are effective in improving adherence to medication regimes for&#xD;
      people with diabetes and hypertension, as well as for physical activity among older adults.&#xD;
      Thus, there is a growing call to provide behavioral interventions within rehabilitation to&#xD;
      increase adherence. However, there is no evidence for efficacy of such interventions in&#xD;
      stroke rehabilitation, let alone specifically for Veterans. Only one systematic review exists&#xD;
      to find that 4 out of 5 randomized controlled trials failed to show statistically significant&#xD;
      differences for a behavioral intervention over control in increasing physical activity&#xD;
      adherence for stroke survivors among the general population. This result indicates that&#xD;
      conventional behavioral interventions are inadequate to address adherence to HEP post-stroke.&#xD;
      This is likely because practicing HEP after stroke is more difficult than taking medication,&#xD;
      and promoting adherence to HEP post-stroke requires more consideration of individual&#xD;
      survivors' psychosocial factors than is needed for medication adherence. Therefore,&#xD;
      understanding Veteran stroke survivors' psychosocial factors is the key to developing a&#xD;
      behavioral intervention that adequately addresses barriers to increase adherence to HEP and&#xD;
      promote recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study will be an observational pilot study using a single group of Veteran&#xD;
      stroke survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home exercise program: Participants will be asked to complete a home exercise program&#xD;
      consisting of upper extremity movement to meet a daily activity goal measured by a wrist-worn&#xD;
      tracker (like a smartwatch).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations: Outcome measures will be administered using conventional clinical assessments&#xD;
      and questionnaires in-person prior to the home exercise program. For the clinical&#xD;
      assessments, participants will be asked to move the affected hand and arm, grasp objects and&#xD;
      perform prescribed tasks such as moving a small wooden block, reaching as high as possible,&#xD;
      and opening the hand as much as possible. These clinical assessments will be videotaped for&#xD;
      scoring. Questionnaires will not be videotaped. Completing clinical assessments and&#xD;
      questionnaires will take about 3-5 hours and can occur over 1-2 visits, depending on the&#xD;
      participant's preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview: Participants will be interviewed at an in-person visit after the completion of the&#xD;
      home exercise program in a semi-structured interview format, to discuss their perspectives on&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators to completing a home exercise program for the upper extremity. The&#xD;
      interview will be audio-recorded for transcription. The interview will last approximately 30&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;

    <description>Home Exercise Program adherence will be quantified as the average percent of an upper extremity activity goal met daily over 7 days after a 3-day baseline period during which activity will be tracked but no home exercise program will be completed. Accommodating for the 3-day baseline period, the 7-day home exercise program period, and any scheduling issues, the total time frame to complete this outcome will be no more than 2 weeks.</description>
