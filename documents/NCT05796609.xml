    <textblock>
      To analyze driving behavior of individuals under the influence of alcohol while driving in a&#xD;
      real car. Based on the in-vehicle variables, the investigators aim at establishing algorithms&#xD;
      capable of discriminating sober and drunk driving using machine learning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Driving under the influence of alcohol (or &quot;drunk driving&quot;) is one of the most significant&#xD;
      causes of traffic accidents. Alcohol consumption impairs neurocognitive and psychomotor&#xD;
      function and has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of driving accidents.&#xD;
      However, autonomous driving (level 4 or 5) is likely to be broadly available only at a&#xD;
      substantially later time point than previously thought due to increasing concerns of safety&#xD;
      associated with this technology. Therefore, solutions bridging the upcoming time period by&#xD;
      more rapidly and directly addressing the problem of drunk driving associated traffic&#xD;
      incidents are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the supposition that driving behavior differs significantly between sober state and drunk&#xD;
      state, the investigators assume that different driving patterns of people under alcohol&#xD;
      influence compared to sober states can be used to generate drunk driving detection models&#xD;
      using machine learning algorithms. In this study, driving for data collection is initially&#xD;
      performed at a sober baseline state (no alcohol) and then after alcohol administration (with&#xD;
      a target of 0.15 mg/l and 0.35 mg/l breath alcohol concentration).&#xD;

    <description>Participants will drive in three different states (sober, drunk above and below the legal limit) on a designated circuit with a real car on a test track accompanied by a driving instructor. After the initial sober driving session, participants are administered pre-mixed alcoholic beverages (e.g., vodka orange). Participants are expected to achieve a target breath alcohol concentration of 0.35 mg/l (legal limit in Switzerland is 0.25 mg/l breath alcohol concentration) before the second driving session starts. Finally, the third driving session starts when the participants' breath alcohol concentration drops to 0.15 mg/l.&#xD;
Participants will be blinded to their alcohol levels during the study.&#xD;
