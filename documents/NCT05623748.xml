  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational study is to validate and evaluate the clinical feasibility of&#xD;
      using a 3-D cell culture model for CTCs isolation/purification and their cell number&#xD;
      expansion in cancer patient with transitional cell carcinoma and patient without cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project first aims to study the clinical feasibility of utilizing a 3-D cell culture&#xD;
      model for the isolation/purification of all possible CTCs in a blood sample in a label-free,&#xD;
      viable, and high-purity manner. Through 3-D CTC culture, moreover, the cell number of CTCs&#xD;
      can be adequately expanded. All these advantageous features are beyond what is currently&#xD;
      possible by using the existing methods. In addition, the harvest of CTCs with above features&#xD;
      is found valuable for the subsequent academic researches or clinical studies (e.g. molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying cancer metastasis, cancer-related gene mutation, biomarker discovery,&#xD;
      and particularly CTCs-based chemotherapy drug testing). These could both facilitate and&#xD;
      accelerate scientists to develop new therapeutic solutions for future cancer care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), the rare cell species present in the blood, are considered to&#xD;
      mainly contribute to cancer metastasis or relapse. Thus, the detection of CTCs is regarded as&#xD;
      an essential clinical tool to detect metastatic cancer. Moreover, CTCs can be the therapeutic&#xD;
      target of metastatic cancer care. Therefore, the use of viable CTCs as a biopsy to select&#xD;
      therapeutic regimens (e.g. CTCs-based anti-cancer drug testing) opens up a promising route to&#xD;
      realize personalized cancer therapy. With the recent advances in cell isolation or detection&#xD;
      techniques, various novel approaches have been actively proposed to isolate/detect CTCs.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, most of current methods might not be able to obtain the all possible, viable,&#xD;
      and label-free CTCs with adequate cell purity and cell number for the subsequent CTCs-based&#xD;
      anti-cancer drug testing or other bioassays. To tackle the above technical hurdles, the&#xD;
      research project proposes the use of a specific 3-D cell culture technique for the&#xD;
      isolation/purification, and cell number expansion of CTCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The working principle is based on our preliminary findings showing that the human leukocytes&#xD;
      will die away in 3-D cell culture condition, whereas the CTCs will tend to aggregate and&#xD;
      proliferate in such environment. Based on this phenomenon, the 3-D CTC cell culture can be&#xD;
      used to isolate and purify the viable CTCs from the leukocyte background in a negative&#xD;
      selection, and label-free manner, enabling the harvest of the all possible CTCs in a blood&#xD;
      sample. Furthermore, the proliferation of CTCs in such 3-D cell culture can adequately expand&#xD;
      the cell number of CTCs for the subsequent applications, which is currently impossible using&#xD;
      the existing methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 1st year research project, investigators will further validate and evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical feasibility of using a 3-D cell culture model for CTCs isolation/purification and&#xD;
      their cell number expansion. In the 2nd and 3rd year research project, investigators will&#xD;
      optimize the 3-D cell culture model so as to increase the performances of CTC&#xD;
      isolation/purification and proliferation. In the optimization process, investigators will&#xD;
      explore the effect of cell culture model (e.g. static or perfusion cell culture, and 3-D cell&#xD;
      culture using different 3-D scaffolding materials) or biochemical factors (e.g. glucose&#xD;
      concentration, serum concentration, pH, or the supplements of growth factors/cytokines) on&#xD;
      the the performances of CTC solation/purification and proliferation. As a whole,&#xD;
      investigators hope the proposed research project can find out an efficient and effective&#xD;
      approach to isolate/purify/expand clinical CTCs in a viable, label-free, and high-purity&#xD;
      manner. These harvested CTCs are valuable for the subsequent analytical tasks.&#xD;
