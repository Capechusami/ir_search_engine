  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer of the lowermost part of the intestine (the rectum) is a common disease and both this&#xD;
      disease and its treatment can have major impact on patients. Unless treated early, the&#xD;
      disease can progress, spread to other parts of the body and ultimately cause death. Treatment&#xD;
      often involves radical surgery, but this too has consequences and risks major complications.&#xD;
      Best outcomes regarding cure with least impact depend on the disease being detected at an&#xD;
      early stage as rectal cancer tends to start first as a non-cancerous polyp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The smallest of these precursor polyps can be easily removed during a routine colonoscopy but&#xD;
      once the polyp grows over 2cm in size it is much harder to categorise correctly as the risk&#xD;
      of it containing cancer somewhere in it increases markedly. If there is definitely cancer&#xD;
      present in such a polyp it is best treated from the outset as a cancer with major surgery,&#xD;
      but if there is definitely not a cancer in it then it can be removed from inside the bowel&#xD;
      with minimally invasive techniques. Unfortunately, despite our current very best methods, up&#xD;
      to 20% of tumours initially thought to be benign are found to be malignant only after they&#xD;
      are excised&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have previously shown that cancerous and non-cancerous tissues can be visually&#xD;
      differentiated by analysis of their perfusion during the examination. For this we use a&#xD;
      specific approved fluorescent dye, indocyanine green (ICG). ICG is commonly used in bowel&#xD;
      surgery anyway to assess the blood supply to the bowel and has a very good safety profile.&#xD;
      ICG is injected into the bloodstream during surgery and the rate at which it is taken up by&#xD;
      various tissue types is detected by specific and approved cameras which can reveal&#xD;
      fluorescence in tissue. We have previously found that the rate of uptake of this dye is&#xD;
      different in cancer tissue compared to non-cancer tissue and have used artificial&#xD;
      intelligence algorithms to measure this difference. However, we now need to ensure that this&#xD;
      method can work also in other patients, in other centres and indeed in other countries to&#xD;
      ensure it is indeed a valid and useful way of assessing rectal polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this observational study is to validate the use of fluorescence pattern analysis&#xD;
      in the classification of rectal tumours. Patients enrolled in the study will attend for a&#xD;
      visual examination of the rectal tumour in theatre as is standard practice. During this&#xD;
      examination a video recording of the fluorescence perfusion will be taken following ICG&#xD;
      administration. Patients will then have the tumour excised or treated as is standard of care&#xD;
      by their surgeon. The video will later be analysed to determine the pattern of fluorescence&#xD;
      perfusion within the tumour, and a classification will be assigned based on the pattern seen.&#xD;
      All tumours that are excised are examined under the microscope by a pathologist to determine&#xD;
      the final diagnosis. The fluorescence based classification will be compared to this&#xD;
      pathological diagnosis to determine the accuracy of the method. So, patients will still have&#xD;
      the exact same standard of care as currently happens, the hope is that in future this method&#xD;
      can be developed to the point where it could be useful by means of a useable, accurate&#xD;
      automated software process. If so, that will form the basis of another study in the future to&#xD;
      look to see if it can guide or even replace biopsies and help with ensuring complete removal&#xD;
      ('clear margins') after excision.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rectal polyps &gt;2cm in size (affecting c. 10,000 patients a year in Europe alone) represent a&#xD;
      considerable clinical challenge. While smaller polyps can be addressed by routine endoscopic&#xD;
      polypectomy and frank clinical cancer will advance through a traditional cancer surgery&#xD;
      paradigm, polyps of this size have the option of being locally excised, intact by transanal&#xD;
      endoscopic resection (also referred to as Transanal Minimally Invasive Surgery, TAMIS). This&#xD;
      is the treatment of choice in this site due to its ability to provide a single complete&#xD;
      unfragmented specimen versus other modalities (e.g. endoscopic submucosal resection). While&#xD;
      the technology and training to enable transanal resection has become much more available over&#xD;
      the past decade (especially TAMIS) meaning more patients can have large benign lesions and&#xD;
      even some early rectal cancers excised in their local specialist centres, the major brake now&#xD;
      on such care is patient selection: i.e. how to tell if a given patient has a benign polyp or&#xD;
      a cancer in advance of its resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic biopsies are notoriously inaccurate in up to 20% of such lesions (rectal cancers&#xD;
      commence most often as adenomatous lesions and so superficial biopsies may miss a malignant&#xD;
      focus). Mistakenly identifying a cancer as a benign lesion and treating it by local excision&#xD;
      significantly worsens prognosis and compromises subsequent cancer surgery - including&#xD;
      potentially converting a reconstructable site of resection (i.e. a lesion suitable for&#xD;
      anterior resection) to an unreconstructable one (i.e. needing an abdominoperineal resection&#xD;
      with permanent colostomy) and by seeding cancer cells into a deep margin or different plane,&#xD;
      particularly as in the case for anteriorly positioned lesions. Additionally, transanal&#xD;
      excision techniques continue to have relatively high rates of positive margins; this risks&#xD;
      regrowth in benign lesions and limits effective local therapy for earliest stage cancers due&#xD;
      to the presence of inapparent disease close to the main tumour bulk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have previously demonstrated, through the use of fluorescent indocyanine green (ICG), that&#xD;
      perfusion is visibly different, between tumour and healthy tissue. This difference can be&#xD;
      captured via infrared video and mathematical analysis can differentiate the perfusion pattern&#xD;
      of malignant areas from any benign/normal tissue also visible in the same endoscopic view. In&#xD;
      brief, the saturation of fluorescence in each region of interest (ie tumour or area of normal&#xD;
      mucosa), can be measured from the recorded video using existing software developed by IBM.&#xD;
      The change in fluorescence over time can be plotted on a curve, demonstrating the inflow,&#xD;
      peak and outflow of ICG, which is depending on the perfusion patters within the region of&#xD;
      interest. These curves differ depending on the tissue being examined and so can be used to&#xD;
      classify benign from malignant tumours through calculating the slope of the uptake and area&#xD;
      under the curve to measure outflow. Therefore, in a location (such as the rectum) where a&#xD;
      cancer is suspected, analysis of the video can be used to differentiate between healthy and&#xD;
      cancerous tissues. This discovery can be made exploited for clinical use by the application&#xD;
      of AI methods including computer vision and machine learning. In essence, the fluorescence&#xD;
      intensity of pixels displaying tissues of interest varies with blood flow (perfusion), when&#xD;
      the blood is dyed with ICG and lit by near-infra-red (NIR) light. The intensity is captured&#xD;
      over time, from multiple video frames, and this intensity is plotted as a curve. The&#xD;
      intensity curves of tumour tissue are different from those of healthy tissue, and those of&#xD;
      benign tumours are different from malignant tumours. Analysis of the curve features for each&#xD;
      pixel in a region of interest can thus lead to a classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such an AI system has been prototyped and trained in the Mater Hospital previously with&#xD;
      videos from a population of Irish cancer patients from two regional centres, so that it can&#xD;
      automatically identify malignant tumours and benign lesions from healthy tissue by their&#xD;
      perfusion patterns. This prototype has previously demonstrated accuracy of &gt;80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we clinically validate the basic concept or method of classifying tissue by&#xD;
      its fluorescence signal characteristics while also seeing if a device can be built on the&#xD;
      basis of this that can extrapolate the data being generated from the videos by UCD staff. We&#xD;
      also address the question of generalisability - can other surgeons use the system and get&#xD;
      similar results from their specific patient cohorts? This will pave the way for future&#xD;
      studies which are planned to determine the roles of biopsy (can the system enable optimal&#xD;
      choice of biopsied tissue, and thus reduce biopsy error?); and tumour resection (can the&#xD;
      system increase the completeness and accuracy of tumour resection?).&#xD;
