    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to study the effects of Immersive Virtual Reality in&#xD;
      patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Could the immersive virtual reality application prevents or reduces anxiety, prevents or&#xD;
           reduces fatigue, prevents or reduces pain, improves therapeutic adherence, prevents or&#xD;
           reduces adverse events, then cancer patients treated with narrative medicine, and then&#xD;
           cancer patients in standard care only?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Could the immersive virtual reality application show symptoms of cybersickness?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated with balanced allocation ratio 1: 1: 1 into three&#xD;
      groups: 1) Virtual Reality group; 2) Narrative medicine group; 3) Standard care group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the virtual reality arm, patients will use a Virtual Reality headset. The multimedia&#xD;
      contents in VR, will have a video quality from 4K to 8K, 360 degrees, and High Definition&#xD;
      audio stereo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In control arm, patients will be free to choose different activities during the infusion of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as conversation with nurses, doctors, trainees, reading, writing, watching&#xD;
      television, listening to music or videos on their smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In narrative medicine arm, patients will express their subjective experience regarding to the&#xD;
      chemotherapy through writing. The experience will be written in free form by the patient and&#xD;
      will cover both the cognitive, emotional and perceptual aspects. A nurse will always be&#xD;
      available to guide the patient in the activity of expressing cognitive, emotional and&#xD;
      perceptual contents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will compare the Virtual Reality group, Narrative Medicine group, Standard care&#xD;
      group, to see the effects regarding to anxiety, fatigue, pain, improves therapeutic adherence&#xD;
      and adverse events.&#xD;

      This study is a three-arms randomized controlled trial that will be conducted at St Giovanni&#xD;
      Paolo II Hospital, Olbia (Italy), from July 2022 to November 2022. This RCT, is an open-label&#xD;
      trial, longitudinal, pre-post test, with balanced allocation ratio 1: 1: 1, monocentric, in&#xD;
      patients with cancer undergoing intravenous chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly allocated into three groups: 1) Virtual Reality group; 2) Narrative&#xD;
      Medicine group; 3) Standard Care group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is Anxiety, measured with State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      are: 1) fatigue measured with Revised Piper Fatigue Scale; 2) pain measured with Visual&#xD;
      Analogic Scale; 3) Adverse effects, measured as manifestation of nausea, vomiting, needle&#xD;
      phobia; 4) Symptoms of cybersickness will be measured with Reality Symptom Questionnaire.The&#xD;
      study will conduct in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the Declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki, with the protocol approved by the Ethics Committee (Trial registration number:&#xD;
      RS 97/CE). A written informed consent will obtain from all patients included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the virtual reality arm, patients will use a Virtual Reality headset. The multimedia&#xD;
      contents in VR, will have a video quality from 4K to 8K, 360 degrees, and High Definition&#xD;
      audio stereo.The Virtual Reality headset will administer through the use of a Virtual Reality&#xD;
      headset.The multimedia contents in VR, will have a video quality from 4K to 8K, 360 degrees,&#xD;
      and HD audio stereo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scenarios are classified into 12 categories: 1) Artistic cities (60 scenarios); 2) Africa&#xD;
      (17 scenarios); 3) Hills (26 scenarios); 4) Rivers, lakes and waterfalls (43 scenarios); 5)&#xD;
      Sardinia (13 scenarios); 6) Deserts (21 scenarios); 7) Beaches (20 scenarios); 8) Animals (20&#xD;
      scenarios); 9) Mountains (25 scenarios); 10) Concerts (21 scenarios); 11) Sea (24 scenarios);&#xD;
      12) submarine (20 scenarios).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In control arm, patients will be free to choose different activities during the infusion of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as conversation with nurses, doctors, trainees, reading, writing, watching&#xD;
      television, listening to music or videos on their smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In narrative medicine arm, patients will express their subjective experience regarding to the&#xD;
      chemotherapy through writing. The experience will be written in free form by the patient and&#xD;
      will cover both the cognitive, emotional and perceptual aspects. A nurse will always be&#xD;
      available to guide the patient in the activity of expressing cognitive, emotional and&#xD;
      perceptual contents.&#xD;
