  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Solid organ transplants affect subjects of all ages, including young women of childbearing&#xD;
      age. The improvement in the management of young female transplant patients makes it possible&#xD;
      to consider pregnancies, about which the literature reports reassuring data on small series.&#xD;
      The question of gynecological follow-up, access to parenthood, as well as the information and&#xD;
      experience of patients regarding these issues after transplantation have thus become topical&#xD;
      issues.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, solid organ transplantation is a common procedure performed all over the world on&#xD;
      patients of all ages. It represents about 900,000 procedures per year worldwide and a little&#xD;
      over 6,100 in France (who.int). It has become indispensable for treating certain pathologies:&#xD;
      for example, renal transplantation is the best alternative for treating end-stage renal&#xD;
      failure, both from the point of view of effectiveness and medical benefit for the patient and&#xD;
      from an economic standpoint. As the indications are increasingly broad, the Foch Hospital is&#xD;
      the leading French center for lung transplantation mainly on patients with cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      but recently transplanted a lung on a patient with end-stage respiratory failure due to&#xD;
      Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have undergone a solid organ transplantation require, after the procedure and&#xD;
      more generally throughout their life, a global management by a multidisciplinary team in&#xD;
      order to maintain a regular and adapted surveillance, in particular because of the&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatments, which are subject to numerous complications (benefit-risk&#xD;
      balance between the rejection episodes and the infectious and carcinological risks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy adds an increased risk of morbidity for transplant patients of childbearing age.&#xD;
      However, progress in terms of follow-up and post-transplant treatment increasingly allows&#xD;
      them to be authorized. In the literature, there are already some reassuring series on the&#xD;
      course of pregnancies after renal or pulmonary transplantation, but the studies are very&#xD;
      often limited to strict obstetrical and neonatal criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the risk of cervical dysplasia is increased in transplant patients. While the HAS&#xD;
      recommends &quot;joint and close follow-up between the referring physician and the gynecologist&quot;,&#xD;
      the gynecological follow-up of young women after solid organ transplantation does not meet&#xD;
      any specific recommendation at present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the question of parenthood has a major place in our societies. It is in this context&#xD;
      that it seems interesting to us to look at the gynecological follow-up of transplant patients&#xD;
      by integrating pregnancies and their outcomes, but also the patients' experiences with regard&#xD;
      to their desire for parenthood.&#xD;
