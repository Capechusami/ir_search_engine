  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) succeeds the active phase of periodontal therapy. SPT&#xD;
      includes repeated supra- and subgingival scaling and root planing (SRP) at all sites with&#xD;
      bleeding on probing and pocket depths ≥ 4-5 mm. Despite the fact that this treatment approach&#xD;
      has been proven to be extremely successful, on a long-time basis, it is associated with&#xD;
      substantial hard tissue loss (i.e. root cementum and dentin) that may lead to an increase in&#xD;
      hypersensitivity, weakening of the tooth and even endodontic complications. Therefore, a&#xD;
      novel treatment concept (Guided Biofilm Management or GBM) consisting of removal of all soft&#xD;
      supra- and subgingival bacterial deposits by means of an erythritol powder air-polishing,&#xD;
      followed by the local, precise removal of supra and subgingival hard deposits (e.g. calculus)&#xD;
      and subsequent use of another sub- and supragingival erythritol powder air-polishing, has&#xD;
      been introduced. Here, the investigators will compare this novel concept (GBM) with the&#xD;
      conventional care during SPT using hand curettes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is solid scientific evidence demonstrating that the clinical results obtained following&#xD;
      active periodontal therapy can be maintained on a long-term basis provided that regular&#xD;
      supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) is rendered. On a routine basis, SPT includes repeated&#xD;
      supra- and subgingival scaling and root planing (SRP) at all sites with bleeding on probing&#xD;
      and pocket depths ≥ 4-5 mm. Despite the fact that this treatment approach has been proven to&#xD;
      be extremely successful, on a long-time basis, it is associated with substantial hard tissue&#xD;
      loss (i.e. root cementum and dentin) that may lead to an increase in hypersensitivity,&#xD;
      weakening of the tooth and even endodontic complications. Since patients enrolled in SPT have&#xD;
      usually probing pocket depths (PPD) &lt; 6 mm and limited supra- and subgingival deposits, the&#xD;
      question arises whether SRP by means of hand and ultrasonic instruments may be needed at all&#xD;
      sites with a PPD &gt; 4 mm with BOP (+) that do not exhibit hard bacterial deposits (e.g. supra&#xD;
      and subgingival calculus). It has been repeatedly shown that bacterial deposits can be&#xD;
      removed from the root surfaces by mere polishing without any SRP, thus leading to comparable&#xD;
      clinical outcomes than following the use of conventional SRP by means of hand instruments&#xD;
      (e.g. metal curettes). The removal of &quot;diseased&quot; root cementum is therefore not necessary to&#xD;
      accomplish clinical success. Results from a recent &quot;in-vitro&quot; study using a novel&#xD;
      &quot;subgingival pocket model&quot; have shown that compared to hand instrumentation, the application&#xD;
      of an air-polishing with erythritol prevents substance-loss and results in a smooth surface&#xD;
      with nearly no residual biofilm that promotes the reattachment of PDL fibroblasts. These&#xD;
      findings are in line with the results of a randomized controlled clinical study which has&#xD;
      shown that biofilm removal by means of an erythritol powder based air-polishing yielded&#xD;
      similar outcomes to those obtained with conventional SRP. Moreover, the use of the erythritol&#xD;
      powder air-polishing yielded statistically and clinically better patient acceptance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these results a novel treatment concept (Guided Biofilm Management or GBM)&#xD;
      consisting of removal of all soft supra- and subgingival bacterial deposits by means of an&#xD;
      erythritol powder air-polishing, followed by the local, precise removal of supra- and&#xD;
      subgingival hard deposits (e.g. calculus) and subsequent use of another sub and supragingival&#xD;
      erythritol powder air-polishing, has been introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors hypothesize that this approach may enable to render a more personalized and&#xD;
      precise treatment for patients enrolled in SPT, thus leading to less hard tissue loss and&#xD;
      better patient acceptance.&#xD;

    <description>This is a categorical variable defined as the percentage of bleeding sites out of the total number of sites. Hereby, all gingival sulci and pockets will be measured with a periodontal probe and bleeding sites will be recorded. The maximum is 100% and the minimum 0%. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Pocket depths will be measured by means of a periodontal probe. The minimal clinically measured pockets are 1 mm and the maximal value for pocket depths allowed in this study is 5 mm. Higher pocket depth values represent worse results. With respect to the reduction in probing depth it is the other way round. A higher value of 3 mm (maximal reduction value) represent better outcomes and a smaller reduction or none (0 mm).</description>
