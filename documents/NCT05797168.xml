             consent prior to collection of samples for optional genetic research that supports&#xD;
             Genomic Initiative. Participants who do not provide informed consent for Optional&#xD;
             Genetic Research may still be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consent to provide adequate baseline tumor sample, as applicable per module-specific&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be â‰¥ 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to provide archival or baseline tumor sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For participants who have previously received targeted therapies such as ADCs, a fresh&#xD;
             baseline biopsy will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with advanced solid tumors must have received prior adequate therapy in&#xD;
             accordance with local practice for their tumor type and stage of disease, or, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator, a clinical trial is the best option for the next&#xD;
             treatment based on response and/or tolerability to prior therapy. Participants with&#xD;
             contraindications or who refuse therapy in accordance with local practice may also be&#xD;
             considered provided that it is documented that he/she was informed about all&#xD;
             therapeutic options.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1,&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A previously irradiated lesion can be considered a target lesion if the lesion is&#xD;
                  progressing and well defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. For participants who undergo biopsies at screening and/or on treatment, it is&#xD;
                  preferred though not required, that the biopsied lesion, be distinct from any&#xD;

             with a female partner of childbearing potential must use a male condom (plus&#xD;
             spermicide, if available) post-screening through 5 half-lives (45 days) plus 6 months&#xD;
             (approximately 7.5 months) following the last dose of study intervention. It is&#xD;
             strongly recommended for the female partner of a male participant to also use a highly&#xD;
             effective method of contraception throughout this period. In addition, male&#xD;
             participants must refrain from sperm donation while on study and for 5 half lives (45&#xD;
             days) plus 6 months (~7.5 months) following the last dose of study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             (b) Female participants: (i) Females of childbearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of&#xD;
             study intervention and a negative urine or serum pregnancy test prior to starting&#xD;
             their next cycle of treatment. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as&#xD;
             negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female participants of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non-sterilized&#xD;
        male partner must agree to use one highly effective method of birth control (defined as one&#xD;
        that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and&#xD;
        correctly), from enrolment throughout the study and for 5 half-lives (45 days) plus 6&#xD;
        months (In total, 7.5 months) following the last dose of study intervention. It is strongly&#xD;
        recommended for the male partner of a female participants to also use male condom (plus&#xD;
        spermicide, if available) throughout this period. Cessation of contraception after this&#xD;
        point should be discussed with a responsible physician. In addition, female participants&#xD;
        must refrain from egg donation while on study and for 5 half-lives (45 days) plus 6 months&#xD;
        (~7.5 months) following the last dose of study intervention.&#xD;

             substantially increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the&#xD;
             participant to give written informed consent.&#xD;

             intervention. Participants can receive Coronavirus (COVID)-19 vaccines, at the&#xD;
             discretion of the Investigator, following a benefit/risk evaluation for the individual&#xD;
             participant and in accordance with local rules and regulations and vaccination&#xD;
             guidelines. Note: If a COVID-19 vaccine is administered it should be done &gt; 72 hours&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to study intervention or any of the excipients&#xD;
             of the product.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Judgment by the Investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if&#xD;
