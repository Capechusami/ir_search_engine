      Open-label, Phase 1 Study of CD19 t-haNK as a Single Agent and in Combination With an IL-15&#xD;
      Superagonist (N-803) and Rituximab in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.&#xD;
      Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 cohorts, as outlined below.&#xD;
      The initial 3 subjects will be sequentially enrolled in a staggered fashion, with a 7 day&#xD;
      interval between each subject to enable the capture and monitoring of any acute and subacute&#xD;
      toxicities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, first-in-human (FIH), open-label study to evaluate the safety of CD19&#xD;
      t-haNK as a single agent and the safety and preliminary efficacy of CD19 t haNK in&#xD;
      combination with rituximab only and in combination with rituximab and N 803 in subjects with&#xD;
      R/R NHL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 20 subjects will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 cohorts, as outlined below.&#xD;
      The initial 3 subjects will be sequentially enrolled in a staggered fashion, with a 7 day&#xD;
      interval between each subject to enable the capture and monitoring of any acute and subacute&#xD;
      toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in both cohorts will initially receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by a&#xD;
      single 4 week cycle of the CD19 t haNK single-agent regimen. Following a 1-week rest period,&#xD;
      subjects will then receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by a single 4-week cycle of&#xD;
      CD19 t-haNK in combination with rituximab (cohort A) or in combination with rituximab and&#xD;
      N-803 (cohort B). Following a second 1-week rest period, subjects will receive up to 4&#xD;
      repeated 4 week cycles of CD19 t haNK in combination with rituximab (cohort A) or in&#xD;
      combination with rituximab and N 803 (cohort B) without lymphodepleting chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>Derived from the parental NK-92 (aNK) cell line, CD19 t-haNK is a human, allogeneic, NK cell line that has been engineered to express a CAR targeting CD19. Similar to the haNK cell line, CD19 t haNK has also been engineered to produce endoplasmic reticulum-retained IL 2 and the high-affinity (158V) variant of the Fcγ receptor (FcγRIIIa/CD16a), and thereby has enhanced CD16-targeted ADCC capabilities. CD19 t-haNK is similar to PD L1 t-haNK, differing only in the CAR that is expressed (CD19 vs PD-L1).</description>
