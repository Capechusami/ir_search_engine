  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Partial nephrectomy(PN) and tumor enucleation(TE) are the two main methods of Nephron-sparing&#xD;
      surgery for early renal cell carcinoma. Because of its blunt separation, TE is often&#xD;
      considered to be difficult to completely remove tumor tissue. In addition, compared with PN,&#xD;
      TE is more difficult and has higher professional requirements for surgeons. Therefore most&#xD;
      surgeons use PN. But Many studies have shown that TE has advantages over PN such as less&#xD;
      trauma, faster recovery, and better protection of renal function without increasing the risk&#xD;
      of tumor recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main renal artery should be clamped during PN to achieve a relatively bloodless operation&#xD;
      environment to ensure the safety of tumor resection. However, too long warm ischemia time&#xD;
      will inevitably affect the function of normal renal tissue. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      shortening the time of renal ischemia is closely related to the recovery of renal function&#xD;
      after the operation. So reducing the time of warm ischemia until zero ischemia has become the&#xD;
      pursuit of surgeons. Based on renal cell carcinoma resection combined with zero ischemia&#xD;
      technique, renal parenchyma, and renal function can be protected to the maximum extent on the&#xD;
      premise of ensuring tumor safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and efficacy of zero-ischemia TE by&#xD;
      analyzing the data of early renal cell carcinoma patients who had undergone PN and&#xD;
      zero-ischemia TE before.&#xD;

      According to the inclusion and exclusion criteriaï¼Œcollecting the data of participants who&#xD;
      have undergone partial nephrectomy or renal tumor enucleation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the difference between TE and PN, clamped-enucleation and&#xD;
      unclamped-enucleation, suture and sutureless zero-ischemia enucleation by the data the&#xD;
      investigators collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After analysing the data, the investigators will discuss the safety and efficay of the&#xD;
      sutureless zero-ischemia tumor enucleation. The patient who would be benefited from this&#xD;
      operation and the patient who would be suggested to undergo this operation will also be&#xD;
      discussed.&#xD;
