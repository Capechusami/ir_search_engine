  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this research is to obtain biological markers of smooth muscle cells&#xD;
      dysfunction or degeneration in cerebral small vessel diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is therefore to build up a biocollection of CSF and blood samples&#xD;
      from 1) patients with CADASIL disease (the most common form of cSVD) responsible for an&#xD;
      accumulation of the NOTCH3 protein in the microvessel wall, 2) patients with other forms of&#xD;
      monogenic cSVD (rarer) which are not responsible for an accumulation of this protein despite&#xD;
      the damage to the smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall and 3) control patients without&#xD;
      cSVD, collected in the context of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This bio-collection will allow the identification and assay of markers testifying to the&#xD;
      damage of the smooth muscle cells (SMC) in different types of cSVD of hereditary origin, the&#xD;
      first of which will be the soluble NOTCH3 protein.&#xD;
