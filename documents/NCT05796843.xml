  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the effects of 360 degree virtual&#xD;
      reality-based mirror therapy (360MT) to traditional mirror therapy (TMT) and conventional&#xD;
      physical therapy (control group) on upper extremity function among stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Would 360MT be more effective when treated for 4 weeks in outcome measure ments&#xD;
           including: Fugl-Meyer Assessment for upper extremity (FMA-UE); manual function test&#xD;
           (MFT); and box &amp; block test (BBT)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How would particants' experience be in terms of satisfactory and enjoyment during 360MT?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have three groups of participants who will be involved in different tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  360MT group: will receive mirror therapy using a virtual reality device (HMD) and&#xD;
           perform tasks with their paralyzed hand. Sessions will last 30 minutes, 3 times a week&#xD;
           for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TMT group: will receive mirror therapy using an acrylic mirror and perform finger,&#xD;
           wrist, elbow exercises using their paralyzed limb. Sessions will last 30 minutes, 3&#xD;
           times a week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: will receive conventional physical therapy consisting of exercises for&#xD;
           the upper extremity, 60 minutes per day, 5 sessions a week, for 4 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment for upper extremity (FMA-UE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline after 4 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The test is one of the most frequently used evaluation tools that quantitatively assesses recovery after stroke by measuring motor skills, balance ability, sensory function, and range of motion. The maximum total score for FMA-UE is 66 points, containing 18 items to evaluate shoulder, elbow, and forearm; 5 for the wrist; 7 for the hand; and 3 items for coordination.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Manual Function Test (MFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline after 4 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This test can reflect the degree of upper extremity dysfunction after stroke, consists of four items each for shoulder and hands. The MFT has a maximum total score of 32 points</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Box &amp; Block Test (BBT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline after 4 weeks of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>used to evaluate manual dexterity of the hands. The evaluation involves wooden blocks (2.5 cm3) placed in a box (53.7cm x 8.5 cm x 27.4cm) which is divided by a partition in the center. The subjects were instructed to move as many boxes as possible from one side to another in one minute using their affected upper limbs.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive mirror therapy using a virtual reality device (Pico G2 VR 4K, Pico, China). They will be asked to follow tasks that are played in HMD using their paralyzed hand. The video played using HMD will be video taped using 360 degree camera prior to the treatment. The 360MT will last 30 minutes/session, 3 sessions a week for 4 weeks. The tasks are finger flexion-extension, wrist flexion-extension and pronation-supination, and elbow flexion-extension for ten repetitions.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive mirror therapy using an acrylic mirror (40cm x 40cm x 3cm) that reflects unparalyzed side of them. They will be asked to perform tasks including finger flexion-extension, wrist flexion-extension and pronation-supination, and elbow flexion-extension for ten repetitions. They will be asked to follow the reflection on mirror using their paralyzed limb. The TMT will last 30 minutes/session, 3 sessions a week for 4 weeks.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive conventional physical therapy including neurodevelopmental therapy, muscle strengthening exercises, and joint mobilization which will be provided 60 minutes per day, 5 sessions a week, for 4 weeks. The therapy will follow upper extremity rehabilitation protocol which consists of three phases of warm up, circuit, and cool down exercises</description>
