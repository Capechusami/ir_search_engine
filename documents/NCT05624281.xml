      This Expanded Access Program (EAP) is intended to facilitate the availability of OFEV®&#xD;
      (nintedanib) to children and adolescents with chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease&#xD;
      (ILD) on top of current standard of care treatment and for whom no satisfactory authorized&#xD;
      alternative therapy exists and who cannot participate in the ongoing 1199-0378 trial.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are not eligible or unable to participate in the ongoing 1199-0378 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children and adolescents 6 to 17 years old at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated written informed consent and assent, where applicable, in accordance&#xD;
             with International Council on Harmonization-Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) and local&#xD;
             legislation prior to admission to the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients. Females of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must confirm that&#xD;
             sexual abstinence is standard practice and will be continued until 3 months after last&#xD;
             drug intake, or be ready and able to use a highly effective method of birth control&#xD;
             per ICH M3 (R2) that results in a low failure rate of less than 1% per year when used&#xD;
             consistently and correctly, in combination with one barrier method, from 28 days prior&#xD;
             to initiation of study treatment, during treatment and until 3 months after last drug&#xD;
             intake. Sexual abstinence is defined as abstinence from any sexual act that may result&#xD;
             in pregnancy. A list of contraception methods meeting these criteria is provided in&#xD;
             the parental information and in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with evidence of fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) on high-resolution&#xD;
             computed tomography (HRCT) within 12 months of Visit 1 as assessed and documented by&#xD;
             the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Further inclusion criteria for the determination of fibrosing ILD on HRCT are defined in&#xD;
        the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) % predicted ≥25% at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant disease at Visit 1, as assessed by the&#xD;
             investigator:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fan score &gt;3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documented evidence of clinical progression over time based on either&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  a 5-10% relative decline in FVC% predicted accompanied by worsening&#xD;
                       symptoms, or&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  a ≥10% relative decline in FVC % predicted, or&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  increased fibrosis on HRCT, or&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  other measures of clinical worsening attributed to progressive lung disease&#xD;
                       (e.g., increased oxygen requirement, decreased diffusion capacity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who must or wish to continue the intake of restricted medications or any drug&#xD;
             considered likely to interfere with the safe conduct of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently enrolled in another investigational device or drug program, or less than 30&#xD;
             days since ending another investigational device or drug program(s) or receiving other&#xD;
             investigational treatment(s). This does not apply to nintedanib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing, or who plan to become pregnant while in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate Transaminase (AST) and/or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;1.5 x Upper Level&#xD;
             of Normal (ULN) at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin &gt;1.5 x ULN at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt;30 mL/min calculated by Schwartz formula&#xD;
             at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with underlying chronic liver disease (Child Pugh A, B or C hepatic&#xD;
             impairment) at Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other investigational therapy received within 1 month or 5 half-lives (whichever is&#xD;
             greater but ≥1 week) prior to Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Further exclusion criteria apply.&#xD;
