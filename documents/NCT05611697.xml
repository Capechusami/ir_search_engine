  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare two bariatric surgical interventions in terms of weight loss,&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux, and effects on obesity-related comorbid conditions in morbidly obese&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleeve gastrectomy is an established therapeutic option for morbidly obese patients without&#xD;
      preexisting gastroesophageal reflux disease. The novel single anastomosis sleeve ileal bypass&#xD;
      (SASI) procedure is already introduced in Norway at a private high-volume bariatric hospital.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of SASI in comparison to an established&#xD;
      bariatric procedure, i.e. sleeve gastrectomy. The primary end point is 2-year changes in BMI&#xD;
      after sleeve gastrectomy and SASI.&#xD;

    <description>The abdominal cavity is entered directly (visual trocar) with or without the use of Verres needle. A 6-port set up and a liver retractor is utilized. A sleeve gastrectomy is performed as described below, but division of the stomach starts 6 cm proximal to the pylorus. The small bowel is measured 300cm from the ileocecal valve, with the small bowel stretched and markers placed on the graspers, and connected to the antrum of the stomach with a 45mm stapler. The anastomosis is positioned slightly ventral on the antrum. A 12 mm port positioned left to the midline is used for introduction of the stapler, which is directed distally from the patient's left to right side. 3.0 cm of 45 mm stapler is used the anastomosis; completed with a 2-0 PDS running suture. The biliopancreatic limb is anchored to the sleeve 4 cm proximal to the anastomosis (non-resorbable V-loc 3-0). Fascia defect is closed for the port where the specimen is extracted. The mesenteric defect is not closed.</description>

    <description>In the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, the abdominal cavity is entered directly with a visual trocar with or without the use of Verres needle. The set up includes a total of 5 ports. The Natanson liver retractor is utilized. The greater omentum is separated from the major side of the stomach from the pylorus to the angle of His. The left crus is visualized and the hiatus is inspected for the presence of hernia. A 36 French bougie is introduced and the stomach is divided along this from 4-5cm proximal to the pylorus to 1cm lateral to the angle of His using two purple cartridges (Medtronic Tri-Staple™ technology) followed by beige 60mm cartridges to the angle of His, 1 cm lateral to the esophagus. The sleeve is tested for leaks with instillation of 50ml methylene blue in the tube. The fascia defect is closed with suture for the port site where the specimen is extracted.</description>
