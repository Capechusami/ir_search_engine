  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hong Kong has notably the longest life expectancy in the world. Ever-increasing demand and&#xD;
      challenges are posing to the healthcare, social welfare, and elderly care service system. As&#xD;
      a global public health strategy to address the increasing burdens, there is a strong urge for&#xD;
      an effective approach to enhance the health and self-care ability among the older adults&#xD;
      dwelling in the community. Literature suggested that the effectiveness of community-based&#xD;
      self-care management programs is inconclusive. In addition, though the concept of the&#xD;
      health-social partnership has been widely promoted to improve primary care, literature&#xD;
      addressed that the multiple barriers existed throughout the collaboration. More evidence&#xD;
      should be sought in the local context to evaluate the effectiveness of self-care complex&#xD;
      interventions program among older adults.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomized type 2 effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial study aims to examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a community-based health-social partnership program in promoting health and&#xD;
      self-care management among older adults dwelling in the community and to explore the reach,&#xD;
      adoption, implementation, maintenance aspects of the implementation process of the program in&#xD;
      a real-life setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two parts. The first part involves a cluster randomized controlled trial with&#xD;
      a two-arm, matched-pairs, equivalent allocation ratio, and parallel design to examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this study. Based on socio-economic status, community centers will be&#xD;
      matched into three comparable pair sets, and further randomized into three intervention and&#xD;
      control groups. A total of 788 subjects (394 in each arm) aged 60 or above, dwelling in the&#xD;
      community, and cognitively competent will be recruited. Three-time interval outcome measures&#xD;
      will be collected. The second part of this study is an implementation research design&#xD;
      concerning the implementation process of the program in a real-life setting. Focus group&#xD;
      interviews with different stakeholders will be conducted and meeting minutes, and archives of&#xD;
      documents will be studied. Summative data will be analyzed in the RE-AIM framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of this study are anticipated to shed some light on the effectiveness and&#xD;
      implementation of integrated health-social service in Hong Kong context. It will make&#xD;
      important contributions, not only to the individuals, but also to the policymakers and&#xD;
      service providers advocating the concept of ageing in place and health-social partnership&#xD;
      approach care. The informed the health-social partnership collaboration practice in&#xD;
      real-world setting can facilitate the translation of research evidence into practice to&#xD;
      tackle the health burdens and challenges.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline pre-intervention (T1), at three-month when the interventions are completed (T2), and three-month post-intervention (T3)</time_frame>
    <description>The General Self-efficacy scale was developed based on social cognitive theory with 20 items originally. It was later shortened to 10 items and translated to Chinese.The items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale, which the higher the score, the greater self-efficacy the respondents possess.</description>

    <measure>Change in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline pre-intervention (T1), at three-month when the interventions are completed (T2), and three-month post-intervention (T3)</time_frame>
    <description>The instrumental activities of daily living is measured by Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Scale-Chinese version, a four-point scale with 9-items of activities which include use of telephone, transportation, shopping, meal preparation, housework, handyman work, laundry, medication management, and money management. Each item rate trichotomously (1 = unable, 2 = needs assistance, 3 = independent) and sum the night responses. Higher score means a worse IADL.</description>
