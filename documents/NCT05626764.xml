  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increasing number of cancer patients are eligible to receive immunotherapy. Efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerance have been demonstrated in multicentre randomized clinical trials with positive&#xD;
      results. However, real-life experience differs from clinical trial results, especially&#xD;
      regarding the management of potential adverse events. HR-QoL (Health Related Quality of Life)&#xD;
      is one of the components of QoL (Quality of Life) in its broad acceptation and is certainly&#xD;
      the only one usually collected in trials while little is known about QoL in cancer patients&#xD;
      treated in the 'real-world'. QUALITOP partners intend to bring together all relevant&#xD;
      longitudinal information present in large heterogeneous data (big data) to estimate patient&#xD;
      QoL and find surrogate markers of QoL and its evolution. Within the QUALITOP consortium, 5&#xD;
      countries will collect prospective clinical and QoL data and also retrospective clinical&#xD;
      data, and share it. This project will enable collecting, managing, sharing, modelling,&#xD;
      processing, and exploiting big data on QoL. Furthermore, beyond the description of QoL,&#xD;
      analytical tools (including causal inference methods and machine learning) are needed to&#xD;
      understand the determinants of QoL and their complex relationships with irAEs (immune related&#xD;
      Adverse Events) in a big-data context where standard statistical techniques would be limited.&#xD;
      Artificial intelligence and causal models may be applied and developed to empower the&#xD;
      patient, prevent adverse medical conditions, and promote QoL. The created knowledge will&#xD;
      enable proposing guidelines for promoting better QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUALITOP aims at identifying the determinants of health status regarding&#xD;
      immunotherapy-related adverse events (IR-AEs, such as toxicities) depending on the patient's&#xD;
      profile in a real-world context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The richness of QUALITOP is in the diversity of the experts who will collaborate in it.&#xD;
      Clinicians involved in the care (thus the health status of the patients) will collaborate&#xD;
      with psychologists and sociologists to understand and integrate complementary dimensions of&#xD;
      QoL related to immunotherapy. Experts in pharmacovigilance and pharmacists will investigate&#xD;
      the IR-AEs and their associations with patient behaviour and non-drug consumption.&#xD;
      Epidemiologists, data scientists (including bioinformaticians and biostatisticians) and&#xD;
      economists will extract information from the data and develop simulation models to produce&#xD;
      knowledge. The project will take place in close relation with patient associations that will&#xD;
      interact with experts to design the analyses, interpret their results, and proceed to their&#xD;
      dissemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to collect data of patients receiving immunotherapy in order to&#xD;
      describe its impact in their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Create the first real-life cohort of cancer patients treated with immunotherapy within a&#xD;
           context of multidimensional management (with data on clinical information,&#xD;
           health-related QoL (HR-QoL), IR-AEs, drug consumption, lifestyle, and administrative&#xD;
           data).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accelerate knowledge directed to different stakeholders (patients, relatives,&#xD;
           clinicians, pharmacists, health authorities, and the general public) for a better&#xD;
           understanding of the determinants of QoL and its optimization after immunotherapy&#xD;
           through the development of innovative analytic tools (artificial intelligence and causal&#xD;
           models).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Produce policies and recommendations to improve patients QoL and participate in the&#xD;
           implementation of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) for 4P medicine (Predictive,&#xD;
           Preventive, Personalized, Participative) in immunotherapy for cancer patients.&#xD;
