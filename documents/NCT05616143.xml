  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Isthmus Logic Carbostent™ is a CE-marked cobalt chromium stent with a bio inducer surface for&#xD;
      the treatment of peripheral iliac artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this post-market retrospective study protocl P22202 is to collect clinical data of&#xD;
      patients treated with Isthmus Logic for the treatment of peripheral iliac artery disease in&#xD;
      routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to obtain long-term follow-up data, the data collection will be limited to patients&#xD;
      that have been treated with these devices at least 12 months prior to the study start.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this post-market study is to systematically collect retrospective clinical&#xD;
      data on the implantable medical device Isthmus Logic in the daily clinical practice in an&#xD;
      unselected population treated within the intended use. Data will be collected via medical&#xD;
      chart review in anonymous form to assess the safety and efficacy of Isthmus Logic. The&#xD;
      Isthmus Logic Carbostent™ stent is made of cobalt chromium alloy and is coated with&#xD;
      iCarbofilm™, a thin carbon film with a high-density turbostratic structure substantially&#xD;
      identical with that of the pyrolitic carbon used for mechanical cardiac valve discs. Coating&#xD;
      the substrate provides it with the bio- and haemocompatible characteristics of pyrolitic&#xD;
      carbon, without affecting the physical and structural properties of the substrate itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two radio-opaque platinum markers at either end of the stent allow for accurate positioning&#xD;
      over the lesion to be treated.&#xD;
