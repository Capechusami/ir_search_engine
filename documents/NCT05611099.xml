  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an unmet medical need for monitoring sleep for multiple nights in a patient's home,&#xD;
      without the inconvenience of traveling and staying overnight in a medical center, and without&#xD;
      the need for a technician to set up a polysomnography (PSG) device at the patient's home.&#xD;
      Several disorders, and particularly sleep disorders, are associated with insomnia symptoms,&#xD;
      and longitudinal sleep assessment may support a better understanding and management of these&#xD;
      patients, who currently seldom access sleep lab PSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On one hand, this study aims at demonstrating whether the final device's user interface&#xD;
      supports safe and effective use when being used at home over multiple nights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other, the study aims at confirming that stable and consistent data are measured in&#xD;
      the device's actual use, for the records to be clinically usable in daily practice.&#xD;

    <measure>TST Correlation</measure>
    <time_frame>3 nights</time_frame>
    <description>Pearson's Correlation between the total time (in minutes) the subject spends asleep (TST) as automatically determined by the Dreem 3S compared to the TST automatically determined by the WatchPAT One (WP1) device on the same night.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dreem 3 System usability</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>As determined by the System Usability Scale. The System Usability Scale establishes a score (the SUS score), between 0 and 100. A score of 68 indicates average performance of a system. A score &gt; 68 indicated the system's usability is above average.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ΔTST Correlation</measure>
    <time_frame>3 nights</time_frame>
    <description>Pearson's correlation on Dreem 3S and WP1 intra-subject, inter-nights TST differences.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Detailed Usability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative feedback on the critical tasks of the Dreem 3 System over multiple nights in a home environment. Questions are graded from &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;, where strongly agree means the subject understands how to interact with the different subparts of the Dreem 3S and experiences no usability issue.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Usability Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Qualitative information regarding the perceptions, opinions, beliefs and attitudes of individuals on the overall subjective experience of the Dreem 3 System over multiple nights in a home environment.</description>
