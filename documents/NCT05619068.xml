  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the evolution of imaging appearances and cognitive function of Moyamoya&#xD;
      disease (MMD) and to establish a prognosis evaluation system based on imaging biomarkers in&#xD;
      MMD. The study may be helpful to optimize and improve the diagnosis and pretreatment&#xD;
      assessment of MMD, and provide an important theoretical supplement to the existing guidelines&#xD;
      for the management of MMD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a chronic progressive cerebrovascular disease of unknown etiology.&#xD;
      It is characterized by chronic progressive stenosis or occlusion of bilateral internal&#xD;
      carotid arteries and abnormal puff vessels at the base of the brain. MMD is one of the&#xD;
      important causes of cerebrovascular accident in young and middle-aged people, which leads to&#xD;
      about 22% of stroke. With the development of neurosurgery, revascularization can effectively&#xD;
      reduce the risk of stroke and other cerebrovascular accidents by increasing cerebral&#xD;
      perfusion. Therefore, this project is expected to improve the diagnosis and pretreatment&#xD;
      assessment of MMD from the traditional level of symptomatology to the level of brain&#xD;
      cognitive function through new imaging methods and clinical approaches. The study of&#xD;
      cognitive function changes in follow-up period or after revascularization, which is of great&#xD;
      scientific significance for understanding the plasticity of cognitive function under&#xD;
      different cerebral perfusion conditions, will also be conducted.&#xD;

    <description>Cognitive decline was defined as decreasing in any of the scale below. Choice reaction time was used as the baseline condition and the index of movement ability. Nonverbal matrix reasoning was used to assess general intelligence and reasoning ability. The Eight-item Interview to Differentiate Aging and Dementia questionnaire was used to determine the degree of cognitive decline in daily life. The mental rotation was used to evaluate the visual-spatial ability. Verbal working memory was used to measure working memory capacity. All cognitive assessment were tested using an Online Psychological Experimental System.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with MMD: Conventional angiography or MRI examination conforms to the&#xD;
             Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of MMD (Neurol Med Chir (Tokyo) 52, 245-266,&#xD;
             2012), It is characterized by stenosis or occlusion of the end of the internal carotid&#xD;
             artery, anterior cerebral artery and/or the beginning of the middle cerebral artery of&#xD;
             unknown cause, accompanied by dilatation of the perforating artery at the base of the&#xD;
             brain or of capillaries on the surface of the brain, i.e., the formation of smoke&#xD;
             vessels. Sign the informed consent. Older than 10 and younger than 60. The education&#xD;
             level of patients reached primary school or above (years of education â‰¥6).&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
