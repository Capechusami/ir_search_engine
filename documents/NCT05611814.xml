  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motion sickness directly impacts the readiness of the Army's aviation units. Severe motion&#xD;
      sickness results in the dismissal of pilot and air crew candidates during initial training,&#xD;
      while minor to moderate symptoms can be distracting during flight. The current medications on&#xD;
      the market that target motion sickness symptoms are prohibited for use before flight.&#xD;
      Osteopathic Manipulative Techniques are a low to no cost option, which lacks side effects,&#xD;
      that allows Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine flight surgeons the opportunity to treat crew&#xD;
      members without the use of pharmaceuticals. If effective, these techniques could be used to&#xD;
      ensure aircrew readiness. Given the paucity of research on such a technique, a small, pilot&#xD;
      study was conducted to demonstrate potential for such an approach.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Motion sickness assessment questionnaire: gastrointestinal subscore from pre- to post-procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered immediately pre and post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire is a valid and reliable measure of the four dimensions of motion sickness: gastrointestinal, central, peripheral, and sopite-related (Gianaros, et al., 2001). It includes 16 items and response format is a likert scale (1 to 9). The difference in scores from pre- to post-procedure were calculated.</description>
