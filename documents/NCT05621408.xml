  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety and depression are associated with work disability, lower participation rate in&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation and unfavourable life style changes following a coronary heart disease&#xD;
      (CHD) event. The prevalence of clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety in&#xD;
      CHD patients has been estimated to 30-50%. Furthermore, depression and anxiety are associated&#xD;
      with a significant increased risk of subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events and&#xD;
      mortality in CHD patients. Psychological interventions for anxiety and depression in CHD&#xD;
      patients have demonstrated small and uncertain effects of symptoms, and no effect on&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes. Therefore, testing the effectiveness of specific psychological&#xD;
      interventions that may affect central mechanisms for cardiovascular outcomes, has been&#xD;
      requested. The Attention training (ATT) Study is a randomized controlled trial comparing&#xD;
      group-attention training to wait-list control in 64 patients who experience significant&#xD;
      anxiety and depression after a CHD event. It will also be explored whether reduction in&#xD;
      psychological symptoms is correlated with changes in biological markers with a potential link&#xD;
      to cardiovascular outcomes.&#xD;
