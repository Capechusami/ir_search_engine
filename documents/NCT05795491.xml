  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the knowledge that VVC is an infectious disease of the genitourinary tract that is&#xD;
      common in women of reproductive age, and because of the shortage of non-drug therapies for&#xD;
      this condition, this study will aim to evaluate the effect of ultraviolet A/blue LED with a&#xD;
      wavelength of 401 ± 5 nm in patients with a clinical manifestation of candidiasis and its&#xD;
      ability to prevent recurrence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is an infection of the vulva and vagina caused by the abnormal&#xD;
      growth of several Candida species. This pathology is one of the most common diagnoses in&#xD;
      gynecological practice and the second most common genital infection. Studies have shown that&#xD;
      15 to 25% of adult women present with fungal colonization despite being asymptomatic and that&#xD;
      75% of them will develop the disease at some point in their lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of VVC involves the use of antifungal agents, either orally or topically, which&#xD;
      resolves 80 to 90% of the cases. However, the use of these agents can lead to the development&#xD;
      of adverse reactions such as dysuria, pruritus, and gastrointestinal disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, a hypothesis arises that the blue/violet light- emitting diode (LED) may be an&#xD;
      alternative treatment for women with VVC because of its antimicrobial effect that has been&#xD;
      proven by several studies. Moreover, it is considered a safe, non-invasive, painless, and&#xD;
      non-toxic technique for use in several types of tissue.&#xD;

    <description>•Litmus paper for measuring vaginal PH before and after treatment and after one month of recurrence. A vaginal pH test measures the acidity of the vagina on a scale of 1-14, by holding a piece of pH paper against the wall of your vagina for a few seconds, then compare the color of the pH paper to the color on the chart provided with the test kit. The number on the chart for the color that best matches the color on the pH paper is the vaginal pH number.</description>
