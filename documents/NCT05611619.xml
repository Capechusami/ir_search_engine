    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the biological mechanisms linking sleep disruption by noise and&#xD;
      the development of disease. In a laboratory sleep study, the investigators will play&#xD;
      synthesised automotive tyre sounds, investigating how acoustical characteristics of tyre&#xD;
      noise impact on sleep macrostructure, cardiometabolic profile and cognitive performance&#xD;
      (continuous traffic flow or a few individual, but higher level, traffic pass-bys). The&#xD;
      investigators will also measure objective sleep quality and quantity, cognitive performance&#xD;
      across multiple domains, self-reported sleep and wellbeing outcomes, and blood samples. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be analysed to identify metabolic changes in different nights. Identifying&#xD;
      biomarkers that are impacted by sleep fragmentation will establish the currently unclear&#xD;
      pathways by which chronic noise exposure at night can lead to the development of diseases in&#xD;
      the long term, especially cardiometabolic disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experimental sleep study has the overarching goal of deepening our understanding of sleep&#xD;
      disruption by automotive tyre noise and changes in cardiometabolic and cognitive function. To&#xD;
      this end, the study will address the following independent aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Determine the biological and neurobehavioural consequences of sleep disruption by tyre&#xD;
      noise. The investigators will measure the sleep of healthy volunteers, and each morning the&#xD;
      investigators will obtain blood samples for metabolomics analysis and administer a&#xD;
      neurocognitive test battery. The investigators will compare effects on sleep, metabolomics&#xD;
      and cognitive function between quiet nights and nights with road traffic noise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Identify acoustical characteristics of tyre noise that are especially disturbing&#xD;
      physiologically. The investigators will use different combinations of types of tyre noise in&#xD;
      different noise exposure nights to determine differential effects on sleep and cardiovascular&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in the sound environment laboratory (SEL) at the University of&#xD;
      Gothenburg Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (Arbets- och miljömedicin&#xD;
      [AMM]). The SEL is a high fidelity research laboratory equipped to simulate a typical&#xD;
      apartment, including three individually light-, sound- and vibration-isolated private&#xD;
      bedrooms. Ceiling mounted speakers in each room allow the investigators to create a realistic&#xD;
      acoustic environment by transmitting sound exposures from the control room to each bedroom&#xD;
      individually. The investigators have shown previously that results from this lab with high&#xD;
      ecological validity are comparable with results from the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two study arms, each one affording the opportunity to investigate different&#xD;
      acoustical characteristics of tyre noise and their physiological effects. Each of these study&#xD;
      arms has a prospective within-subjects cross-over design. Participants (study 1 N=15; study 2&#xD;
      N=30; total N=45 across both arms) will each spend six consecutive nights in the SEL, with a&#xD;
      sleep opportunity between 23:00-07:00. Daytime sleep will be prohibited, confirmed with&#xD;
      measures of daytime activity via wrist actigraphy monitors worn continuously throughout the&#xD;
      study. Three subjects will take part concurrently, in separate bedrooms. The first night is a&#xD;
      habituation period to the study protocol and for familiarisation with the test procedures.&#xD;
      Study nights 2-6 are the experimental nights and will be randomly assigned across&#xD;
      participants using a Latin square design to avoid first-order carryover effects. Each subject&#xD;
      will be exposed to each of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One quiet night: No noise will be played, serving as a control night to assess individual&#xD;
      baseline sleep, cardiometabolic profile, and cognitive performance;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four traffic noise nights: Tyre noise from road traffic noise be played into the rooms to&#xD;
      determine the effects of noise on sleep, cardiometabolic function and cognitive performance.&#xD;
      These noise nights will be in a 2×2 factorial design so that the investigators can examine&#xD;
      each combination of two specific noise characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each night the investigators will record physiologic sleep with polysomnography (PSG) and&#xD;
      cardiac activity with electrocardiography (ECG). Each study morning, subjects will provide a&#xD;
      4 ml blood sample, complete cognitive testing and answer questionnaires and will depart the&#xD;
      SEL to follow their normal daytime routine. They will return to the SEL at 20:00 each evening&#xD;
      to prepare for sleep measurements. Caffeine will be prohibited after 15:00 and alcohol will&#xD;
      be prohibited at all times. Because extreme and/or variable dietary behaviour can affect the&#xD;
      metabolome/lipoprotein profile, participants will be given guidance that they should eat a&#xD;
      similar evening meal on each day of the laboratory study, confirmed with a food diary, The&#xD;
      actual meal itself can be different for different study participants, because the study has a&#xD;
      within-subjects design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep will be recorded with ambulatory polysomnography (PSG) and cardiac activity with&#xD;
      electrocardiography (ECG) and finger pulse photoplethysmogram. Data are recorded offline onto&#xD;
      the sleep recorder, and will be downloaded and checked every study morning to ensure data&#xD;
      quality. In addition to traditional sleep analysis performed by the research group at the&#xD;
      University of Gothenburg, raw PSG data will be used to calculate the Odds Ratio Project, a&#xD;
      novel metric of sleep depth and stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study morning subjects will provide a 4 ml blood sample for plasma metabolomics&#xD;
      analysis. To ensure reliable data, blood samples will be taken at the same time every day to&#xD;
      mitigate circadian effects, before eating or drinking anything except water, and each sample&#xD;
      will be handled in the same way i.e. centrifuged, aliquoted and stored in -80C freezers.&#xD;
      Subjects will eat the same food each study evening to mitigate within-subject dietary effects&#xD;
      on the blood metabolome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each morning, subjects will complete a computerised cognitive test battery taking&#xD;
      approximately 20 minutes, that includes 10 tests across a range of cognitive domains (motor&#xD;
      praxis, visual object learning, fractal 2-back, abstract matching, line orientation, emotion&#xD;
      recognition, matrix reasoning, digit symbol substitution, balloon analog risk, psychomotor&#xD;
      vigilance). Cognition data will be analysed to determine key measures of cognitive speed and&#xD;
      accuracy, adjusting for practice effects and the difficulty of the stimulus set.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a battery of one-time validated questionnaires to measure their&#xD;
      general health (SF-36), chronotype, noise sensitivity, habitual sleep quality, environmental&#xD;
      sensitivity, and annoyance and sleep disturbance by noise. Subjects will also answer a&#xD;
      questionnaire each study evening and morning, involving questions on sleepiness (Karolinska&#xD;
      Sleepiness Scale), sleep disturbance by noise, positive and negative affect (PANAS), and&#xD;
      validated sleep and disturbance questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear a wrist actigraphy monitor continuously throughout the study period,&#xD;
      and also for the week before the study, to confirm habitual sleep-wake times and to measure&#xD;
      physical activity levels.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants will be aware that in any given study night they can be exposed to traffic noise. They will not be informed what noise condition will occur in any given night, but they can become unblinded to the exposure if they are awake, as they will hear the noise.&#xD;
Study investigators responsible for analysing cognitive performance variables and physiological sleep data will be be blind to which noise interventions were introduced on which study nights.</masking_description>
