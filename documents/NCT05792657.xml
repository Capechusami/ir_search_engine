  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ambition of the ABEL feasibility study is to test new &quot;green prescription&quot; follow-up&#xD;
      models that can get more women with obesity, regularly active, with improved health and&#xD;
      physical fitness. The project will evaluate the effect on exercise behavior, total physical&#xD;
      activity level and mental and physical health outcomes by four different follow-up models by&#xD;
      an exercise professional: HIGH-dosage in-person exercise coaching (four session monthly),&#xD;
      MEDIUM- dosage in-person exercise coaching (two sessions monthly) LOW-dosage in-person&#xD;
      exercise coaching (one session monthly). The main aim of this study is to evaluate which of&#xD;
      these follow-up models is most effective on improving women's exercise adherence, total&#xD;
      physical activity level, physical fitness, and mental and physical health. This will be&#xD;
      weighed against the cost of each of the follow-up models, in order to identify the best model&#xD;
      from a socioeconomic cost-effectiveness perspective. Moreover, the study will identify&#xD;
      potential barriers among patients, General Practitioners and exercise professionals that&#xD;
      prevents optimal outcome from the current green prescription model.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity, defined as &quot;abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health&quot;&#xD;
      and a body mass index (BMI) of ≥30, represents a major health challenge and economic burden&#xD;
      for welfare systems worldwide. Living with obesity is reported to account for 80-85% of the&#xD;
      risk of developing non-communicable diseases such as diabetes type 2. Guidance on regular&#xD;
      physical activity, exercise and healthy eating is traditionally the first measure taken for&#xD;
      patient who undergo treatment for obesity. Treatment for obesity in the primary healthcare&#xD;
      service is largely coordinated by general practitioners (GP). Green prescriptions (tailored&#xD;
      advice and guidance on lifestyle factors related to development of disease, such as physical&#xD;
      activity and healthy eating) can be prescribed as a treatment alternative to patients with&#xD;
      chronic disease, such as obesity. However, few GPs in Norway use green prescriptions as a&#xD;
      treatment alternative to their patients, and 41% of GPs in 2006 reported that they had newer&#xD;
      prescribed green prescriptions to their patients. The lack of sufficient follow-up of&#xD;
      patients has been reported as a main limitation with the current green prescription model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research underlines the importance in-person coaching for patients who receives&#xD;
      green prescriptions, as well as establishing collaborations with professions such as exercise&#xD;
      professionals to be able to provide sufficient coaching of patients. Hence, in-person&#xD;
      coaching by an exercise professional may have the means to get more patients with obesity&#xD;
      regularly active, and can potentially be the follow-up alternative the current green&#xD;
      prescription model is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, considering the expenses and practical considerations associated with in-person&#xD;
      coaching, has former studies displayed the advantage of using web-based behavioral support&#xD;
      for patients with obesity. Yet, web-based behavioral support often proves to have poor&#xD;
      completion rate, and need to be combined with face-to-face guidance and feedback in order to&#xD;
      increase adherence. However, when combining in-person coaching and web-based behavioral&#xD;
      support, there is still limited knowledge on how frequent in-person coaching needs to occur,&#xD;
      in order to increase adherence. More knowledge on frequency of follow-up is essential for an&#xD;
      approach towards an economical sustainable green prescription model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In women with obesity (BMI≥30), what is the effect of in-person exercise coaching (high&#xD;
           vs. medium vs. low dosage) on exercise adherence and total physical activity level?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In women with obesity (BMI≥30), what is the effect of in-person exercise coaching (high&#xD;
           vs. medium vs. low dosage) on mental health variables (quality of life, self-efficacy&#xD;
           and barriers and motivation to exercise)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In women with obesity (BMI≥30), what is the effect of in-person exercise coaching (high&#xD;
           vs. medium vs. low dosage) on health (glycated hemoglobin, cholesterol, blood pressure,&#xD;
           waist circumference, BMI and urinary incontinence) and physical fitness (aerobic&#xD;
           endurance, muscular strength)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is adherence to exercise and succeeding health effects associated with the exercise&#xD;
           professionals level of education and knowledge base?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What are the participant's experiences, barriers and facilitators of participating in&#xD;
           the ABEL-project?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. What are the general practitioners' experiences, barriers and facilitators of using the&#xD;
           &quot;green prescription&quot;?&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present feasibility study, women with obesity (BMI of ≥30, n=200) will be recruited to&#xD;
      a 20-week randomized control trial (RCT) with four arms. Participants will be recruited via&#xD;
      social media platforms (Facebook and Instagram). Using simple computer-based randomization&#xD;
      program, participants will be randomized to one of the following arms: HIGH dosage in person&#xD;
      exercise coaching, MEDIUM dosage in-person exercise coaching, LOW dosage in-person exercise&#xD;
      coaching, and CONTROL group. A total of 25 exercise professionals, working full time as a&#xD;
      personal trainer will follow up the participants at one of the following fitness clubs:&#xD;
      &quot;Feel24&quot;, &quot;PT-group&quot;, &quot;Nr1 Fitness&quot;, &quot;Trento&quot; or &quot;Spenst&quot;. All participants in the&#xD;
      intervention arms (HIGH, MEDIUM and LOW) groups are provided the same frequency (each week)&#xD;
      of follow-up by the exercise professional. At baseline, all participants will respond to an&#xD;
      electronic questionnaire, perform measures of muscular strength and aerobic endurance,&#xD;
      measure blood pressure, hip-waist ratio, BMI (height and weight) and take a blood sample&#xD;
      (Tigeni Kit). After a 20-weeks intervention period, participants will perform a post-test&#xD;
      including the same previous mentioned outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      n=15 of women from intervention arms HIGH (n=5), MEDIUM (n=5) and LOW (n=5), will also be&#xD;
      invited to participate in an in-depth interview in order to investigate participants&#xD;
      experiences and barriers for participating in the ABEL feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the RCT, the project will also recruit GPs (n=8) to participate in an in-depth&#xD;
      interview with researchers from the project group. GPs will be recruited to provide more&#xD;
      in-depth understanding on reasons for what the current green prescription model is lacking.&#xD;
