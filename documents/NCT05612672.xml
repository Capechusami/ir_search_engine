  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial analysis have become important tools in&#xD;
      public health informatics but have rarely been applied to the hospital setting. In this study&#xD;
      we apply these tools to address the challenge of Hospital Acquired Infections (HAIs) by&#xD;
      building, implementing, and evaluating a new computer application which incorporates mapping&#xD;
      and geographic data to assist hospital epidemiologists in identifying HAI clusters and&#xD;
      assessing transmission risk. We expect that incorporation of geographic information into the&#xD;
      workflow of hospital epidemiologists will have a profound effect on our understanding of&#xD;
      disease transmission and HAI risk factors in the hospital setting, radically altering the&#xD;
      workflow and speed of response of infection preventionists and improving their ability to&#xD;
      prevent HAIs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospital Acquired Infections are common, affecting 3.2% of acute care hospital admissions.&#xD;
      Recent reports have shown an improvement in overall HAI rates, primarily driven by&#xD;
      improvements in surgical site (SSI) and catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI).&#xD;
      Transmissible infections, such as Clostridium difficile (CDI), have not shown the same&#xD;
      decrease over time. This may be because prevention of CDI requires a comprehensive&#xD;
      hospital-wide approach addressing environmental and patient-level risk factors. Geographic&#xD;
      Information Systems (GIS) and spatial analysis techniques have become an important tool in&#xD;
      public health informatics because they can integrate a vast number of data sources and&#xD;
      explore associations and patterns in the data not visible using traditional biostatistical&#xD;
      methods. Applications of GIS and spatial analysis are wide ranging but have largely been&#xD;
      ignored in the hospital setting. The objective of this research is to develop a HAI&#xD;
      assessment tool, which incorporates geographic data on the hospital and patient-level data&#xD;
      from the electronic health record system, that is useful for hospital infection&#xD;
      preventionists in better identifying clusters of HAI and assessing potential risk. We bring&#xD;
      together a multidisciplinary team of clinical, operational, and academic investigators with&#xD;
      expertise in GIS and spatial analysis, patient safety, public health informatics, usability&#xD;
      assessment, and mixed- methods evaluation. As part of a larger study, this aim will seek to&#xD;
      implement a GeoHAI tool that uses spatio-temporal Bayesian models to identify clusters of&#xD;
      NHSN-defined hospital onset CDI and multidrug resistant organisms (MDRO) and predict&#xD;
      potential high risk areas given hospital and patient risk factors. Unique to our approach is&#xD;
      an evaluation strategy that focuses on the reduction of hospital acquired infection, but also&#xD;
      seeks to understand how the tool and the information derived from the tool impacts patient&#xD;
      safety practices in the hospital. We expect the implementation of this tool to radically&#xD;
      change the workflow and speed of response of infection preventionists, greatly improving&#xD;
      their ability to prevent HAI instead of reacting after they have occurred.&#xD;
