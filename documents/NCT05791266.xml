  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lavender and ylang ylang oil pad was attached to the shirts of healthy volunteers for 2&#xD;
      hours. The outcomes were evaluated before, during and 30 minutes after removal of the pad.&#xD;
      Adverse reactions, irritation score, and quality of life were assessed. Blood pressure and&#xD;
      pulse rate were also measured&#xD;
