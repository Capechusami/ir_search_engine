      The aim of this study is to compare ultrasound-guided ESBP and Rhomboid block in terms of&#xD;
      postoperative pain management, postoperative opioid consumption and complications in patients&#xD;
      undergoing lobectomy with VATS.Patients aged 18-75 years, ASA 1-2-3, who gave informed&#xD;
      consent to lobectomy with video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) method will be included in&#xD;
      this study. Patients with contraindications for the application of either method, known&#xD;
      chronic pain, local anesthetic allergy, spinal deformity or mental or psychiatric problems&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS); Although it causes less postoperative pain compared&#xD;
      to traditional thoracotomy, it can still cause significant postoperative problems. Relief of&#xD;
      postoperative pain; it eliminates the undesirable pathological effects of pain, reduces the&#xD;
      length of hospital stay and costs. Thoracic epidural analgesia and paravertebral block are&#xD;
      recommended for the relief of postoperative pain after thoracotomy. Bendixen et al. Because&#xD;
      VATS is less painful; recommended less invasive regional techniques and systemic analgesics.&#xD;
      For the relief of postoperative pain after VATS; paravertebral block, erector spina plan&#xD;
      block (ESPB), and serratus plan block have been successfully applied. In order to provide&#xD;
      analgesia after VATS; the most appropriate techniques or protocols need to be determined.&#xD;
      ESPB; In 2016, Forero et al. and is used for the control of pain after many surgical&#xD;
      procedures. ESPB has been successfully applied for the relief of postoperative pain after&#xD;
      VATS. Elsharkawy et al. have shown that rhomboid intercostal block can be beneficial in&#xD;
      providing adequate analgesia for both anterior and posterior hemithorax, in cadaver studies,&#xD;
      but it is better with methods that are useful in relieving pain after VATS previously. They&#xD;
      say more comparisons are needed. In recent studies, it has been shown that rhomboid&#xD;
      intercostal block is effective in relieving postoperative pain in comparison with control&#xD;
      groups (10). More randomized controlled studies are needed to demonstrate that rhomboid&#xD;
      intercostal block provides effective analgesia in VATS. The aim of this study is to compare&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided ESBP and Rhomboid block in terms of postoperative pain management,&#xD;
      postoperative opioid consumption and complications in patients undergoing lobectomy with&#xD;
      VATS.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to compare ultrasound-guided ESBP and Rhomboid block in terms of&#xD;

      and mixed. A closed envelope will be drawn randomly for each patient before the procedure,&#xD;
      and procedures will be carried out according to the group specified on the paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative anesthesia management The patients in this group were on the operating table&#xD;
      before induction of anesthesia, and in the ESPB group (Group 1), after the patients were&#xD;
      placed in the prone position, the linear ultrasound probe was placed in the midline in the&#xD;
      transverse plane, and spinous processes were visualized at the T5 vertebra level, and the&#xD;
      transverse process, trapezius, latissimus dorsi and erector spina muscles were visualized on&#xD;
      the side where VATS was planned. will be displayed. With an 'in-plane' approach, using a 22&#xD;
      gauge 5-8 cm block needle with extension line (Braun, Melsungen, Germany), which can be seen&#xD;
      on ultrasound, the skin, subcutaneous and trapezius, latissimus dorsi and erector spina&#xD;
      muscles are passed in the cranio-caudal direction and 0.5- After confirming the needle site&#xD;
      with 1 ml of saline, the ESPB will be administered with 20 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine by&#xD;
      visualizing the local anesthetic spread linearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the rhomboid intercostal block group (Group 2), after the patients are placed in the prone&#xD;
      position, the ipsilateral arm is positioned towards the chest, allowing the scapula to move&#xD;
      laterally and the area called auscultation triangle to be opened, and after the skin&#xD;
      disinfection of the surgical side; By using a linear ultrasound probe, the rhomboid major and&#xD;
      intercostal muscles will be defined in the auscultation triangle region, and a 50-80 mm&#xD;
      needle will be injected into the plan between them at the T5-6 level with an in-plane&#xD;
      approach with 20 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine and local anesthetic injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under standard monitoring (ECG, non-invasive blood pressure, and finger oxygen saturation),&#xD;
      anesthesia induction will be performed with propofol (2 mg/kg), remifentanil 1mcg/kg, and&#xD;
      rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg. Bispectral index (BIS) and analgesia nociception index (ANI) monitoring&#xD;
      will be started immediately after intubation. Anesthesia will be maintained with remifentanil&#xD;
      infusion, with ANI &gt; 50 and BIS &lt; 50. Patients were given 1 g i.v. before waking up after&#xD;
      surgery. paracetamol will be given. Measurements Perioperative clinical and demographic data&#xD;
      of each patient will be collected: age, gender, diagnosis, operation, ASA, duration of&#xD;
      surgery, duration of anesthesia. Intraoperatively, heart rate, blood pressure, ANI and BIS&#xD;
      measurements will be made and recorded in all patients at 15-minute intervals. The total&#xD;
      intraoperative opioid dose will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-awakening pain will be assessed and recorded using the visual analog scale (VAS), then&#xD;
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) will be initiated, with all patients locked in 15 minutes&#xD;
      and given 4 mg of morphine at each application by the patient. Pain assessment will be done&#xD;
      with VAS at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. In the postoperative period, the amount&#xD;
      of morphine administered by PCA (in the first and second 24 hours) and any additional&#xD;
      analgesics required (tramadol, paracetamol, etc.) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sample size In a previous study, based on the consumption of morphine equivalent in the first&#xD;
      24 hours (approximately 2.75 mg standard deviation) [8], it was found that 33 patients per&#xD;
      group were required to detect the 2.5 mg difference between the two groups with 90% power and&#xD;
      5% alpha error. . Considering that there may be a dropout of approximately 10 percent, it is&#xD;
      planned to include at least 35 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis In the comparison of the two groups in terms of continuous numerical&#xD;
      variables, Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test will be used for independent samples&#xD;
      according to distribution. Groups will be compared in terms of categorical variables using&#xD;
      the Pearson chi-square test or the Fisher exact test. Two-way ANOVA test will be used for&#xD;
      repeated measurements in comparison of groups in terms of the course of postoperative VAS&#xD;
      scores and intraoperative heart rate, blood pressure, ANI, BIS variables over time. A value&#xD;
      of p&lt;0.05 will be accepted as an indicator of significance in the tests.&#xD;
