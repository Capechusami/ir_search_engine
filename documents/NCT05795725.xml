    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the diagnostic potential of Artificial&#xD;
      Intelligence-assisted Fecal Microbiome Testing for the diagnosis of colon cancer. The main&#xD;
      question it aims to answer is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Is Artificial Intelligence-assisted Fecal Microbiome Testing a reliable screening test for&#xD;
      colon cancer?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to provide fecal samples to be analyzed with next-generation&#xD;
      sequencing techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is a comparison group: Researchers will compare the diagnostic performance of&#xD;
      AI-assisted Fecal Microbiome Testing with colonoscopy to see the correlation between the&#xD;
      results of both interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colon cancer, also known as colorectal cancer, is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer&#xD;
      worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer deaths. In the United States alone, it is&#xD;
      estimated that there will be approximately 149,500 new cases and 52,980 deaths from&#xD;
      colorectal cancer in 2021. However, if detected early, it is highly treatable and curable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the gold standard for colon cancer screening is a colonoscopy, which involves the&#xD;
      insertion of a flexible tube with a camera into the rectum to examine the colon for signs of&#xD;
      cancer or precancerous growths called polyps. While effective, this procedure is invasive,&#xD;
      uncomfortable, and can be costly. As a result, many people delay or avoid colon cancer&#xD;
      screening, which can lead to delayed detection and worse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal microbiome testing is a promising alternative to colonoscopy as a screening tool for&#xD;
      colon cancer. The human gut is home to trillions of bacteria that play a critical role in&#xD;
      maintaining our health, and research has shown that changes in the gut microbiome can be&#xD;
      associated with the development of colon cancer. Artificial Intelligence-assisted fecal&#xD;
      microbiome testing involves analyzing the composition of the gut microbiome using advanced&#xD;
      algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify patterns that are indicative of colon&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This non-invasive, low-cost, and convenient screening test has the potential to significantly&#xD;
      increase colon cancer screening rates and reduce the number of deaths from this disease. By&#xD;
      identifying individuals at high risk of colon cancer at an early stage, Artificial&#xD;
      Intelligence-assisted fecal microbiome testing can lead to earlier intervention and better&#xD;
      outcomes. Therefore, the diagnostic potential of AI-assisted fecal microbiome testing for&#xD;
      colon cancer is a highly relevant and important area of research.&#xD;
