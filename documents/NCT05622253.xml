  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acne erythema consists of telangiectasia and erythematous papules, without a comedo, which&#xD;
      occurs as a result of inflammatory acne. Moreover, although acne erythema is common in acne&#xD;
      patients, no satisfactory medical or surgical treatment is available for this condition. Some&#xD;
      acne erythema lesions may improve with time, but the persistent acne erythema, which is&#xD;
      experienced by most patients, is cosmetically unacceptable and leads to frustration and&#xD;
      psychological distress.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to the present time, there have been several studies on the clinical efficacy of different&#xD;
      laser modalities for acne treatment. Pulsed dye laser (PDL), 585 or 595 nm, has been&#xD;
      demonstrated as one of the effective treatment options Another laser long-pulsed neodymium:&#xD;
      yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser with 1064 nm has been commonly used for skin&#xD;
      rejuvenation. Nevertheless, the efficacy of this laser for acne treatment has been shown in&#xD;
      some studies and case reports. The therapeutic effect on acne lesions is believed to be&#xD;
      mediated by the selective photothermolysis of vessels, the upregulation of TGF-Î², the&#xD;
      reduction of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and Toll-like receptors-2 (TLR-2), and the thermal&#xD;
      destruction of sebaceous glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isotretinoin remains the mainstay of acne treatment. No doubt, the side effects of this&#xD;
      effective drug holds physicians back from jumping to prescribe it. Recent data suggested that&#xD;
      lower doses (0.25 mg/kg/day) may lead to fewer side effects. and fewer flares. Clearing the&#xD;
      use of oral isotretinoin in combination with other procedures has expanded our therapeutic&#xD;
      options to obtain better control.&#xD;
