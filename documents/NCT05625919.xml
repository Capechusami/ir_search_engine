  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ⅰb/Ⅱ multi-center study of safety and efficacy of Sirolimus for Injection&#xD;
      (Albumin-bound) in patients with advanced malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumor&#xD;
      (PEComa).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, multi-center, open-label, Phase Ⅰb/Ⅱ clinical trial. For phase Ⅰb,&#xD;
      patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced soft tissue sarcomas&#xD;
      (including malignant PEComa, accounting for at least 1/2) that have failed standard treatment&#xD;
      (disease progression or relapse or intolerance, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted&#xD;
      therapy, etc.) or lack effective treatment. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) will be&#xD;
      determined in phase Ⅰb. For phase Ⅱ, patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis&#xD;
      of malignant PEComa that is either metastatic or locally advanced and for which surgery is&#xD;
      not a recommended option. Phase Ⅱ will use the recommended dose and dosing regimen from Phase&#xD;
      Ⅰb.&#xD;
