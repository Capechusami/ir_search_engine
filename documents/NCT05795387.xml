  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical triall is to investigate the training effect of access to authentic&#xD;
      patient video on mental status examination performance among 5th year Danish medical&#xD;
      students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate if&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Students with add-on access to an authentic patient video e-library have improved Mental&#xD;
           Status Examination precision compared to students that only have an add-on e-library&#xD;
           with simulated patient videos.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of videos watched correlate to mental status examination test scores.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main study is a a two-armed, pragmatic cluster-randomised, superiority, partial-blinded,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial where the interventions are e-learning courses that serves as&#xD;
      add-on learning material during the psychiatric clerkship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two student groups are compared. The experimental intervention(V) is a larger e-learning&#xD;
      module, where the students have access to 23 authentic patient video vignettes and an&#xD;
      e-module on mental status exam including demonstration videos with simulated patients (actor&#xD;
      videos). The comparator students (N-V) only have access to the e-module on mental status exam&#xD;
      including demonstration videos with simulated patients. All students participate in the&#xD;
      regular Psychiatry curriculum i.e. 16 lectures in one week and psychiatric clerkship in three&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As students have their clerkship in 10 different facilities across the Island of Zealand, we&#xD;
      carry out cluster-randomization based on clerkship location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Communication, recruitment and data management is carried out within the university teaching&#xD;
      platform (CANVAS), by manual extraction, and by questionnaires distributed by SurveyXact.&#xD;

    <masking_description>As mentioned, it will not be possible to mask students or local lecturers to allocation group. PI receives the clerkship student enrolment list from the faculty, randomize at clerkship location level and merge it with the consent lists collected digitally in SurveyXact. The students that have consented to participation receives individual invitation to the designated e-module. The instructor carrying out the digital mental status examination test, has no information of arm allocation. Statistical analysis will be performed by researcher blind to arm allocation, and masking will only be broken when the primary outcomes have been analyzed and a conclusion has been formulated based on the masked allocations.</masking_description>

    <measure>Mental status exam skills test</measure>
    <time_frame>A week after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The test consists of three subtests each consisting of a video vignette, not accessible in the library (i.e. none of the students had seen it previously) with a forced choice test (FCT). This results in a scoring range of -15 to + 15 points per FCT. The MSE-skills test score consists of the student's average score of the three FCTs.</description>

    <description>The evaluation is carried out by a validated questionnaire of 10 items, to be answered on a 5-point Likert scale.

    <description>The intervention consist of access to the video e-library on their e-learning platform.&#xD;
The video e-library consists of 23 videos of brief patient interviews, mostly with inpatients, with adjoining MSE written by three faculty psychiatrists. Selected videos are used for demonstration of phenomena, and five videos will have audio explanation of the resulting MSE.&#xD;
As well as the authentic patient videos on the e-library there are some pages with written theoretical instructions on the MSE, a brief animated movie and some simulated videos by an actor all regarding the MSE.</description>

    <description>For the present trial, also the NV students will receive the same non-authentic patient material I.E written theoretical instructions on the MSE, a brief animated movie and some simulated videos by an actor all regarding the MSE. Ensuring it is the authentic patient video e-library and not the theoretical information responsible for the expected difference in scores.</description>
