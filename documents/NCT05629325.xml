  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over clinical trial of&#xD;
      buspirone in patients with complaints of dysphagia due to poor esophageal motility. The goal&#xD;
      of this clinical trial is to study the effect of buspirone on esophageal motility by&#xD;
      performing high resolution impedance manometry (HRiM).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal motility disorders can be characterized by poor esophageal motility with impaired&#xD;
      clearance of the esophagus. Examples are Ineffective Esophageal Motility (IEM, &gt;70% of the&#xD;
      swallows are ineffective or â‰¥50% are failed) and Absent Contractility (100% failed&#xD;
      peristalsis). Both might be the underlying cause for dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that poor esophageal motility can be manipulated by&#xD;
      pharmacological means. Buspirone, a 5-HT1A agonist, is able to significantly increase distal&#xD;
      esophageal wave amplitude and duration in healthy volunteers, suggesting it may be effective&#xD;
      in IEM. At the moment, findings in patients with IEM are not consistent and depend on the&#xD;
      dose and treatment duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cross-over trial will examine the use of buspirone in patients with dysphagia, with the&#xD;
      intent of using a higher dose. We will use impedance/manometry and pressure flow analysis to&#xD;
      liquid, viscous and solid boluses to evaluate the symptomatic and manometric effect of&#xD;
      buspirone.&#xD;

They will be randomized on a 1:1 basis: Patients will be randomized to take buspirone for 4 weeks or placebo for 4 weeks. After a 2-week washout period the randomized groups will cross over into the alternate treatment.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>A randomization list will be prepared by the laboratorium Wolfs (Zwijndrecht, Belgium) and the trial medication will be labeled by the laboratorium Wolfs based on the randomization list. The randomization list is prepared separately from study investigators or coordinators. The participant, investigator and study team are blinded to the allocated treatment arm in both intervention periods (buspirone/placebo). Each study patient will be assigned a subsequent randomization number. If a medical emergency occurs and a decision about the subject's condition requires knowledge of the treatment assignment, the investigator will immediately notify the laboratorium Wolfs to break the blind for this individual subject.</masking_description>

             (a large break (&gt;5 cm length) in the 20-mmHg isobaric contour with DCI &gt; 450&#xD;
             mmHgÂ·sÂ·cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Absent contractility is defined as 100% failed swallows (DCI &lt; 100 mmHgÂ·sÂ·cm), with a&#xD;

             has not been on oral, injectable, implantable or intrauterine contraception, a urinary&#xD;
             pregnancy test will be performed prior to administration of Buspirone/Placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must be capable of understanding and be willing to provide signed and dated&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients cannot participate in this study if:&#xD;
