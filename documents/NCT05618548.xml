    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether pregnant and lactating women can develop similar&#xD;
      protective immunity as non-pregnant women against Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19) upon vaccination, without safety issues. Immunogenicity and safety of all&#xD;
      currently licensed COVID-19 vaccines that are administered to pregnant and lactating women in&#xD;
      Belgium will be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will compare vaccination of pregnant women with age-matched non-pregnant women&#xD;
      and women vaccinated in the postpartum period during lactation. The primary objectives are to&#xD;
      assess the immune responses (humoral immunity, cellular immunity, mucosal immunity) and&#xD;
      safety after either administration of the Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA, Pfizer BioNtech),&#xD;
      the COVID-19 Moderna vaccine (mRNA, Moderna), the COVID-19 vaccine Vaxzevria (Viral Vector,&#xD;
      Astra Zeneca) or any other vaccine that will become available for the Belgian population.&#xD;

        To evaluate the immune response and safety after vaccination against COVID-19 in pregnant&#xD;
        and lactating women, four cohorts will be included (Cohort A-D). An additional cohort of&#xD;
        lactating women (Cohort E) will be included in the study. In this cohort, only the effect&#xD;
        of COVID-19 vaccination on breast milk composition will be evaluated.&#xD;
