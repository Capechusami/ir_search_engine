    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter clinical study to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of preoperative short-course radiotherapy combined with AK104 and chemotherapy +&#xD;
      TME surgery in patients with advanced rectal cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies included a screening period (no more than 28 days after participants signed informed&#xD;
      consent form to 28 days before first dose), treatment (receiving appropriate treatment until&#xD;
      disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, death or study&#xD;
      end, whichever occurs first), and follow-up (including safety follow-up and survival&#xD;
      follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will receive short-course radiotherapy (SCRT), IMRT/VMAT, pelvic 25Gy/5f/1&#xD;
      week. Two weeks after the end of treatment, subjects continued to receive neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy regimen for 4 cycles: AK104 10 mg/kg, intravenous&#xD;
      infusion every 3 weeks (Q3W), plus CAPOX (capecitabine: 1000mg/m2, bid, po, d1-14,&#xD;
      oxaliplatin: 130mg/m2, ivgtt, d1), Q3W. Neoadjuvant therapy was assessed 2 weeks after the&#xD;
      end of neoadjuvant therapy, and TME surgery was performed 4 weeks after the end of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy (R0 surgery was performed). Patients are not recommended to enter the&#xD;
      organ preservation observation; If the efficacy after preoperative chemoradiotherapy is&#xD;
      evaluated as clinical complete remission (cCR) and the patient strongly refuses surgery, the&#xD;
      patient should be informed of the risk of recurrence and ask the patient to sign a rejection&#xD;
      of surgery. Medication safety is assessed and, depending on the severity of adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs) and drug relevance, investigators will take steps to ensure subject safety. After&#xD;
      surgery (or patients who strongly refuse surgery) there is a 30- and 90-day safety follow-up,&#xD;
      and survival assessments are performed every 3 months to obtain survival information and&#xD;
      collect new tumor treatment information until the death of the participant, withdrawal of&#xD;
      informed consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
