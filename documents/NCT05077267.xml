      An open label phase 2 trial to evaluate safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      ABNCoV2 vaccine after IM application. The trial will evaluate a homologous prime-boost&#xD;
      regimen with 100 µg ABNCoV2 in initially seronegative adult subjects (Group 1), as determined&#xD;
      by a qualitative test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, compared to a single boost vaccination with&#xD;
      100 µg (Group 2) or 50 µg (Group 3) ABNCoV2 in initially seropositive subjects, as defined by&#xD;
      a positive qualitative test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and a history of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination&#xD;
      or previous COVID-19 disease at least 90 days prior to planned trial vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this Phase 2 trial ABNCoV2-01, in a run in phase 6 adults (comprising of 3 subjects in&#xD;
      each Group 1 and 2) will be vaccinated at 1 clinical trial site in a consecutive manner, with&#xD;
      an at least 48 hours interval between the first and second subject of each group, then the&#xD;
      second and third subject dosed on consecutive days, before opening up to full enrolment of&#xD;
      the trial. Safety assessments will be based on solicited and unsolicited AE data (first week&#xD;
      after vaccination) evaluated by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). After a&#xD;
      positive DMC recommendation, enrolment to the rest of Group 1 and 2 of the trial will&#xD;
      commence. Group 3 subjects will be enrolled after completion of Group 2 enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase 2 trial will evaluate a homologous prime-boost regimen with 100 µg ABNCoV2 in&#xD;
      initially seronegative adult subjects (Group 1), as determined by a qualitative test for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, compared to a single boost vaccination with 100 µg (Group 2) and 50 µg&#xD;
      (Group 3) ABNCoV2 in initially seropositive subjects, as defined by a positive qualitative&#xD;
      test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and either a history of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or previous&#xD;
      COVID-19 disease (Group 2 and 3) at least 90 days prior to planned trial vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the timing of the addition of Group 3, enrollment into Group 2 will be completed prior&#xD;
      to enrolling subjects into Group 3. Therefore, no randomization will be required for the&#xD;
      seropositive subjects.&#xD;

        dose of an authorized COVID-19 vaccine regimen in subjects with a previous diagnosis of&#xD;
        COVID-19 or a mix/match series of 2 doses of any authorized COVID-19 vaccine will be&#xD;
        considered as a completed vaccination.&#xD;
