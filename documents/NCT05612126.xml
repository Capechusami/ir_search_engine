  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sporting activities such as football tournaments are instrumental in promoting community&#xD;
      mental health. A community-based football tournament intervention will benefit the&#xD;
      participating individuals' physical and mental health and promote community cohesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anticipated benefits of the proposed football tournament are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To bring a greater sense of community cohesion and togetherness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve physical and mental health (e.g., increase fitness, reduce anxiety,&#xD;
           depression, loneliness, suicidal ideation or self-harm).&#xD;
