    <textblock>
      Forward head posture (FHP) is a common postural abnormality that can be seen in all age&#xD;
      groups. It is characterized by the head position being forward relative to the neck in the&#xD;
      sagittal plane. The anterior displacement of the head is mainly assessed through examination&#xD;
      of the craniovertebral angle (CVA) and a CVA of ˂50° is described as a FHP. Therapeutic&#xD;
      exercises have shown to be effective in FHP and related symptoms in many studies. One of the&#xD;
      exercise programs applied is the corrective exercise program. Within the scope of this&#xD;
      program, deep cervical flexor muscles and shoulder retractors are strengthened, cervical&#xD;
      extensors and pectoral muscles are stretched. This exercise protocol has been reported to&#xD;
      provide relief in neck pain, improvement in CVA and shoulder angle. However, the number of&#xD;
      studies examining the effect of corrective exercise program for the affected muscle groups in&#xD;
      FHP on muscle activation parameters is limited, and there is no study examining the effect on&#xD;
      the biomechanical properties of the muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it is aimed to investigate the effect of corrective exercise program on&#xD;
      alignment, muscle activation and biomechanical properties of muscles in medical students with&#xD;
      forward head posture.&#xD;

    <description>The activity levels of trapezius, sternocleidomastoid and pectoralis muscles will be measured with a wireless EMG system (Delsys, Inc, Boston, MA). The electrodes will be positioned on the belly of the muscle. The signals will be amplified and band-pass filtered (20-450 Hz) before being record digitally at 2000 samples per second, and then the root mean square (RMS) will be calculated. To normalize individual muscle contraction levels, we will use maneuvers of voluntary contractions.</description>

    <description>The state of tension and biomechanical properties will be measured with a hand-held device (MyotonPro®, Myoton AS, Tallinn, Estonia). MyotonPro® displays the muscle mechanical properties by analyzing the oscillations of the myofascial tissue in response to the 10 short (15 ms) impulses, at 0.56 Newton (N) force and frequency of 1Hertz (Hz) applied by the probe of the device.&#xD;
The superficial muscles (trapezius, sternocleidomastoid and pectoralis muscle) will be evaluated.&#xD;
The device measures (computes simultaneously) the following parameters: Oscillation frequency (Hz), dynamic stiffness (N/m) and logarithmic decrement.&#xD;
Oscillation Frequency [Hz]: Characterizes the tone (intrinsic tension) of a muscle in its passive or resting state.</description>
