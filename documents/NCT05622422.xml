      The intervention aims to activate patients' inherent resources and by this, facilitate&#xD;
      empowerment, patient activation, and self-care management of their chronic disease. The&#xD;
      participants will include people 18 years and older that have been diagnosed with a chronic&#xD;
      disease. This pilot study will use a pre-post design. Data will be collected initially and&#xD;
      then at the seventh session. The intervention will be provided in seven sessions face-to-face&#xD;
      for the first three sessions and then via video conferencing for the last four sessions. Each&#xD;
      session is facilitated by three researchers. Once the sessions are finished the participants&#xD;
      will be invited to a focus session so that qualitative data can be collected in week nine.&#xD;

    <description>There will be three groups of 10 participants with a chronic disease that will receive the Body knowledging Program. The intervention aims to activate patients' inherent resources and by this, facilitate empowerment, patient activation, and self-care management of their chronic disease. The participants will include people 18 years and older that have been diagnosed with a chronic disease. This pilot study will use a pre-post design. Some of the data will be collected initially, then the intervention will be provided in seven sessions the first three face-to-face at a local community center and then the last four sessions through video conferencing that will be facilitated by three researchers. Data collection will take place at the first session and then again at the seventh session. The participants will be invited back in week nine to attend a video conference focus group to obtain qualitative data. Both qualitative and quantitative data will be analyzed.</description>
