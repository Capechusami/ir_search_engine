      This study investigates the safety and efficacy of sodium pentaborate pentahydrate in&#xD;
      patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an increasing trend in the burden of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) globally. Although&#xD;
      different therapies like tyrosine kinase inhibitors, ablative therapy, surgery, and&#xD;
      immunotherapy have been suggested for RCC, they are not cost-effective. The present study&#xD;
      will be conducted as an open-label, phase Ib/II study consisting of a dose-escalation stage&#xD;
      followed by a cohort expansion stage. The trial will be conducted in the medical centers&#xD;
      affiliated to the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. Patients 18 years or older&#xD;
      presenting with histologically confirmed RCC with a clear-cell component, that progressed to&#xD;
      the advanced or metastatic stage will be recruited. The dose-escalation stage will determine&#xD;
      the schedule and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Expansion Stage dose of&#xD;
      sodium pentaborate pentahydrate. One oral sodium pentaborate pentahydrate capsule once daily&#xD;
      will be considered for evaluation in 21-day treatment cycles: 500 mg, 1000 mg, and 1500 mg.&#xD;
      Subjects will accrue in escalation cohorts of 3-6 subjects using a &quot;3 plus 3&quot; design and&#xD;
      dosing will begin at the 500 mg dose level of sodium pentaborate pentahydrate. During this&#xD;
      stage, the decision to open a new cohort will be made when all subjects have been followed&#xD;
      for at least 21 days following the first dose of sodium pentaborate pentahydrate(defined as&#xD;
      the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) Evaluation Period). In the dose-expansion stage, we will&#xD;
      further assess the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of NaB in RCC&#xD;
      using the recommended dose and schedule as determined in the dose-escalation stage. The&#xD;
      primary objectives for the dose-escalation stage and dose-expansion stage will be to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose and schedule for the&#xD;
      subsequent expansion stage and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the sodium pentaborate&#xD;
      pentahydrate by estimating the objective response rate, respectively. The investigator will&#xD;
      assess each subject continuously to evaluate for potential new or worsening adverse events.&#xD;
