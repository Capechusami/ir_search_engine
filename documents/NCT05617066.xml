      150 patients of legal age will participate in this project, diagnosed with systemic&#xD;
      sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned, as will be detailed later, to one of the following three&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy Group (GT): This group will be made up of 50 patients who will receive cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy of coping with stress (online modality) in groups of 10-12 people during&#xD;
      twelve sessions Consecutive weekly courses of 1.5 to 2 hours duration taught by psychology&#xD;
      professionals. of this mode 4 subgroups will be made. Psychological Support Group (AP): This&#xD;
      group will be made up of 50 patients who will receive psychoeducation about stress and its&#xD;
      consequences and the specific stress suffered by people with a autoimmune disease such as&#xD;
      scleroderma. It will have a duration of twelve weekly sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive sessions of 1.5 to 2 hours in length taught by professional psychologists. In&#xD;
      this way they will 4 subgroups. Usual Care Group (CG): This group will be made up of 50&#xD;
      patients who will follow their usual care. Later, once the study is over, they will be&#xD;
      offered to participate in coping with stress to the person who is interested.&#xD;

      150 elderly patients diagnosed with systemic sclerosis in any of its variants, both diffuse,&#xD;
      limited or sine scleroderma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are: diagnosis made by a medical specialist, good command of the&#xD;
      Spanish language (oral and written comprehension) and have an internet connection. As&#xD;
      exclusion criteria they must not suffer no psychiatric illness. Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned into each of the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent. Patients must be informed in writing of the objectives of the project and&#xD;
      of the work protocol in which they are going to be included. Once read and understood, They&#xD;
      will sign the consent. The research staff is obliged to save said consents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality and data protection commitment. Ethical principles will be followed and&#xD;
      deontological related to psychological research collected in the main codes currently&#xD;
      nationally or internationally: The Code of the Official College of Psychologists (1987), the&#xD;
      Meta- Code of the European Federation of Psychological Associations (1995), and The Ethical&#xD;
      Principles and Code of Conduct of Psychologists of the American Psychological Association&#xD;
      (2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the evaluation as well as the therapies will be carried out online through Google Form&#xD;
      and GoogleMeet, where questions regarding sociodemographic variables and information will be&#xD;
      asked related to variables about your disease: disease variant (ESd, ESl or ESss), profile of&#xD;
      autoantibodies, age at diagnosis, evolution time, presence of Raynaud's, current digital&#xD;
      ulcers, pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease, esophageal involvement, intestinal&#xD;
      involvement, renal or cardiac involvement; as well as current treatment. Information will&#xD;
      also be collected on possible comorbidities: high blood pressure, diabetes,&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia, and toxic habits such as tobacco and/or alcohol&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the psychological evaluation, the following instruments will be completed:Perceived&#xD;
      Stress Scale (EEP-14). It's about a instrument that evaluates the perception of stress in&#xD;
      different life situations. It is composed of fourteen items on a five-point Likert-type&#xD;
      scale. It has adequate reliability (consistency internal=.81 and test-retest= 0.73). Stress&#xD;
      Vulnerability Inventory (IVE). This questionnaire assesses the individual's predisposition to&#xD;
      be influenced by perceived stress. This composed of twenty-two dichotomous items and the&#xD;
      maximum value that can be obtained is twenty-two points. The Cronbach's alpha reliability&#xD;
      coefficient is 0.87.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Connor and Davidson Resilience. Assesses resilience being understood as the individual's&#xD;
      ability to coping and adapting to circumstances, is made up of twenty-five Likert-type scale&#xD;
      items of five points; higher scores reflect greater resilience. It has good reliability with&#xD;
      an alpha of Cronbach of 0.89. Revised Symptom Inventory (SCL-90-R). It is an instrument with&#xD;
      ninety items on a five-point Likert-type scale, zero being nothing and four much, which&#xD;
      evaluates nine dimensions: somatization, obsession-compulsion, depression, anxiety,&#xD;
      hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation and psychoticism. The scale also consists of&#xD;
      seven extra items distributed into three global distress indices: the GSI, which measures&#xD;
      global psychological distress, the PSDI, which is used to measure the intensity of symptoms&#xD;
      and the Total Symptom Index which is used to measure the number of symptoms that the person&#xD;
      reports. The scores are transformed into percentiles (0-100), in this line the percentiles&#xD;
      ≥75 represent clinical symptoms in any of the subscales of this instrument. The nine&#xD;
      dimensions show acceptable reliability, with Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency of&#xD;
      0.81.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUROQOL-5Q health questionnaire. Measure quality of life related to health (HRQoL) both in&#xD;
      the general population and in groups of patients with different pathologies. The individual&#xD;
      himself assesses his state of health, first in levels of severity by dimensions and then on a&#xD;
      more general assessment visual analog scale. A third element is the index of values that is&#xD;
      obtained for each state of health generated by the instrument. The descriptive system&#xD;
      contains five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, activities of daily living,&#xD;
      pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and each of them has three levels of severity (no&#xD;
      problems, some problems or moderate problems and serious problems). In this part of the&#xD;
      questionnaire the individual must mark the level gravity corresponding to his state of health&#xD;
      in each of the dimensions, referring to the same day to complete the questionnaire. In each&#xD;
      dimension, severity levels are coded 1 if the response option is &quot;no (I have) problems&quot;; with&#xD;
      a 2 if the answer option is &quot;some or moderate problems&quot;; and with a 3 if the answer option is&#xD;
      &quot;many problems&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIENER life satisfaction scale.It consists of five items that assess satisfaction with life&#xD;
      through the global judgment that people make about this from the degree of agreement (from 1:&#xD;
      STRONGLY DISAGREE to 5: STRONGLY AGREE) on five aspects: if the type of life is similar to&#xD;
      what has always been dreamed of having, if the conditions of life are excellent, if I am&#xD;
      satisfied with my life, if important things have been obtained and finally if I could live&#xD;
      again I would like everything to be the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short Survey on Health SF-36.Short survey on health of 36 items (SF-36) of. The 36 items&#xD;
      measure eight dimensions: Physical function (limitations in physical activities due to health&#xD;
      problems), Social function (limitations in social activities due to physical or emotional&#xD;
      problems), Physical role (limitations in activities of roles due to physical health&#xD;
      problems), Body pain, General mental health (discomfort and well-being), Social Role&#xD;
      (limitations in usual role activities due to problems emotional), Vitality (energy and&#xD;
      fatigue), Perception of general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of cortisol concentrations in hair: Strands of hair with a diameter of&#xD;
      Approximately 3 mm, near the scalp, in the middle posterior region of the head, where the has&#xD;
      indicated less variability in cortisol levels. They will be cut with scissors clean as close&#xD;
      to the scalp as possible, not including the hair follicle itself, not recommended for&#xD;
      analysis. Each hair sample will be kept in aluminum foil and inside an airtight bag, so that&#xD;
      neither light nor moisture penetrates the sample. For this, each participant will be sent&#xD;
      both a tutorial as an envelope with the entire kit for collecting and storing the sample&#xD;
      (except the scissors), for once collected, they are sent to the laboratory of the Faculty of&#xD;
      Pharmacy of the University of Granada, where the levels of cortisol in hair will be analyzed&#xD;
      and obtained. This whole process will be totally free for the patients.&#xD;
