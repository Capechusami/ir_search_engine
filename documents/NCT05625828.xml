      The goal of this interventional study is to compare in community dwelling elderly people the&#xD;
      effects of two physical activity programs to prevent accident falls : &quot;SILVER XIII EQUILIBRE&quot;&#xD;
      program and &quot;VIVIFRAIL&quot; program, on several risks factors such as executive functions and&#xD;
      functional capacities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform a 1 hour physical activity session during 10 weeks and effects will&#xD;
      be measured using a multidimensional test battery. &quot;SILVER XIII EQUILIBRE&quot; program contains&#xD;
      cognitive-motor exercises where participants have to perform two tasks simultaneously such as&#xD;
      answering math questions while walking whereas &quot;VIVIFRAIL&quot; program contains multifactorial&#xD;
      exercises such as walking, balance training and resistance training in single-task condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main question it aims to answer is :&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Does physical activity enriched with simultaneous cognitive exercises enhances the effects&#xD;
      ?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Falls in the elderly are a problem of increasing importance in our aging societies. Among the&#xD;
      multiple intrinsic risk factors, if the age-induced decline of functional and locomotor&#xD;
      capacities are recognized risk factors, impaired executive functioning is another equally&#xD;
      important one. Thus, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) - characterized by an early deficit in&#xD;
      executive functioning but not pathological - turns out to be an independent and significant&#xD;
      risk factor. In order to reduce the impact of this problem and thus promote &quot;well aging&quot;, it&#xD;
      is essential to develop effective preventive approaches on all of these risk factors. Of&#xD;
      these, cognitive-motor fall prevention programs - based on simultaneous cognitive and motor&#xD;
      tasks - are the most effective in reducing the rate of falls. However, since 2017, the French&#xD;
      Rugby League Federation has been proposing such an innovative program called &quot;SILVER XIII -&#xD;
      EQUILIBRE&quot; consisting of 10 one-hour sessions per week and including a majority of&#xD;
      cognitive-motor exercises. In addition, this program also includes exercises for learning the&#xD;
      &quot;play the ball&quot;, a specific technical gesture of rugby league that consist of shooting the&#xD;
      ball with the heel and making a step forward which is close to the stepping strategy to avoid&#xD;
      falling. Initially intended for community dwelling elderly people and non-fallers presenting&#xD;
      a usual aging (average age = 67.6 +/- 3 years), it turns out that this program welcomes three&#xD;
      different profiles of elderly people that we find in the literature: (1) young-aged, active&#xD;
      people with no deficits in functional and cognitive abilities; (2) older people with optimal&#xD;
      cognitive aging but less active (3) older people with MCI. As the effects of regular Physical&#xD;
      Activity (PA) depend on the initial level of each individual, it could be that the effects of&#xD;
      the &quot;SILVER XIII - EQUILIBRE&quot; program on both functional abilities and executive functions&#xD;
      depend on the profile of Old person. In order to answer the main question the effects of the&#xD;
      &quot;SILVER XIII EQUILIBRE&quot; program will be compared to an active comparator : the &quot;VIVIFRAIL&quot;&#xD;
      program which is a international multifactorial program to prevent falls based on walking,&#xD;
      balance and resistance training single task exercises.&#xD;
