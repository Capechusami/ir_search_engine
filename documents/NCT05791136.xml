  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence and mortality of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma are at the forefront in&#xD;
      China.Most part of patients are elderly. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard&#xD;
      treatment for unresectable locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Most elderly&#xD;
      patients cannot tolerate concurrent chemotherapy because of complications and other reasons.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy has definite efficacy and low toxicity in advanced esophageal squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma, and the results combined with radiotherapy have also been preliminarily reported.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy&#xD;
      combined with immunotherapy in elderly patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, phase Ⅱ clinical study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of radiotherapy alone followed by sequential injection of Toripalimab in&#xD;
      elderly patients with unresectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who could not accept&#xD;
      concurrent chemotherapy.&#xD;
