  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to simulate a meal eaten at home, where meals will provide a fixed&#xD;
      amount of protein from beef or vegetarian substitute &quot;meat&quot; balls with ad libitum access to&#xD;
      one of mashed potatoes, full-fat fries, or pasta. Postprandial glycemia (PPG), insulin,&#xD;
      active ghrelin, satiety, amino acid response and food intake (FI) at the meal and again 3h&#xD;
      later (after an ad libitum pizza meal) will be measured. In addition, post-meal PPG and&#xD;
      satiety will be measured for one hour after the second meal.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 30 participants (15 males, 15 females) will be recruited in this study at the&#xD;
      University of Toronto. Each participant will attend 6 study sessions where they will consume&#xD;
      meals consisting of a fixed amount of beef or vegetarian substitute &quot;meat&quot; balls providing 25&#xD;
      g protein with ad libitum access to one of mashed potatoes, fried French fries, or pasta.&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be filled out to assess their recent food intake, physical activity,&#xD;
      sleep quality, stress level, appetite, physical comfort, and energy/fatigue level, as well as&#xD;
      palatability of the food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected at fasting and at various time points over a 3 hour period&#xD;
      after eating the meals to measure blood glucose, insulin, active ghrelin and amino acid&#xD;
      concentrations. After 3 hours, participants will receive an ad libitum pizza meal to assess&#xD;
      their food intake compensation. Post-meal PPG and satiety will be measured for one hour after&#xD;
      the pizza meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Consumption of potatoes in their most usual forms (mashed or deep fried), when compared&#xD;
           with pasta in either meat or vegetarian based meals result in lower FI at the meal and&#xD;
           lower PPG and insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compensation for the reduced FI in the mashed potato meal does not occur at a pizza meal&#xD;
           3h later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lower PPG and insulin post-test meal and second meal will be found.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The amino acid profile of different meals will be reflected in post-prandial plasma&#xD;
           levels and the amino acid response to vegetarian based meals with potatoes will be more&#xD;
           balanced compared to the vegetarian based meals with pasta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effects of potato consumption served with either meat or vegetarian&#xD;
      substitute &quot;meat&quot; on meal-time FI and PPG, insulin, satiety and FI compensation at a later&#xD;
      meal in healthy and normal weight adults. FI and PPG are primary outcomes and satiety,&#xD;
      insulin, active ghrelin, amino acid response and FI compensation are secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: To simulate at home-style meals and determine their effects on FI, satiety, PPG,&#xD;
      and insulin, over three hours. Meals will be served with a fixed amount of beef or vegetarian&#xD;
      substitute &quot;meat&quot; balls providing 25 g protein with ad libitum access to one of mashed&#xD;
      potatoes, fried French fries, or pasta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: To determine the effect of at home-style meals with beef or a vegetarian&#xD;
      substitute with mashed potatoes on FI compensation at an ad libitum pizza meal 3h later.&#xD;
      Post-meal PPG and satiety will be measured for one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: To compare the amino acid response for 3 h after the meat and vegetarian based&#xD;
      meals served with mashed potatoes, French fries, or pasta.&#xD;
