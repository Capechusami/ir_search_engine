      The PRIMER (Pre-Habilitation With Mindfulness and Exercise for Patients Undergoing Radical&#xD;
      Cystectomy) trial is a pilot designed to estimate the feasibility of integrating a home-based&#xD;
      pre-operative exercise and mindfulness program (pre-habilitation program) for patients&#xD;
      scheduled to undergo radical cystectomy for bladder cancer in an attempt to improve both&#xD;
      physical and psychological conditioning pre-operatively.&#xD;

    <measure>Patient-reported health-related quality of life as assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>4-8 weeks pre-operatively, 2 weeks pre-operatively, 30 days post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ BLM 30 consists of 30 questions developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. It incorporates nine multi-item scales: five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality-of-life scale. Several single-item symptom measures commonly reported by cancer patients (dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation and diarrhea) and perceived financial impact of the disease. The questionnaire was designed to be cancer-specific, multidimensional in structure, appropriate for self-administration, and applicable across a range of cultural settings. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A higher score represents higher symptomatology in each respective domain.</description>

    <measure>Dispositional mindfulness as assessed by the Mindfulness Awareness Attention Scale (MAAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4-8 weeks pre-operatively, 2 weeks pre-operatively, 30 days post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The Mindfulness Awareness Attention Scale (MAAS) is a 15-item scale designed to assess a core characteristic of mindfulness, namely, a receptive state of mind in which attention, informed by a sensitive awareness of what is occurring in the present, simply observes what is taking place. Total scores range from 0 to 6; higher scores indicate higher dispositional mindfulness.</description>

    <measure>Perceived stress as assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale 10 (PSS 10)</measure>
    <time_frame>4-8 weeks pre-operatively, 2 weeks pre-operatively, 30 days post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>the Perceived Stress Scale 10 (PSS 10) is a 10-item survey that captures the respondent's stress level in the past month and uses a Likert scale to assess different domains of stress. Individual scores on the PSS 10 can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress.</description>
