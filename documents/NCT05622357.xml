  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) using short&#xD;
      course radiation therapy (SCRT) followed by full course of chemotherapy then surgery in&#xD;
      locally advanced rectal cancer. The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is total neoadjuvant treatment in this design safe &amp; tolerable?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impact of this design on treatment related outcomes in terms of pathological and&#xD;
           clinical responses.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be assigned to an experimental arm in which preoperative short course 5 x 5 Gy&#xD;
      radiation therapy is followed by six cycles of combination chemotherapy (capecitabine and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin) and surgery within 4-6 weeks&#xD;
