    <textblock>
      This proposal will evaluate a series of peer-mediated interventions (PMIs) for preschool&#xD;
      children (3 to 6 years) with ASD and limited or no spoken language, using an innovative&#xD;
      Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design. Available evidence supports&#xD;
      the beneficial effects of PMIs for improving social communication in children with ASD.&#xD;
      Peer-related social competence is vital to a wide range of child outcomes, such as improved&#xD;
      communication and fewer behavioral problems. Unfortunately, approximately 30% of children&#xD;
      with ASD remain minimally-verbal in kindergarten, restricting participation in inclusive&#xD;
      activities. Recent studies report improved communication after a speech-generating device&#xD;
      (SGD) is included in treatment. Effective interventions that can be modified is necessary to&#xD;
      ensure optimal communication outcomes when children do not make anticipated progress. A&#xD;
      strength of the study is that these interventions can be adopted by community-based, early&#xD;
      service providers. All participants will receive an adapted Stay-Play-Talk (SPT)&#xD;
      peer-mediated intervention that varies in active ingredients. With SMART designs, it is&#xD;
      possible to test and identify alternative combinations of PMI approaches, such as the&#xD;
      addition of a SGD. In this study, 132 preschoolers with ASD (and N=264 peers without&#xD;
      disabilities) will be initially randomized to SPT and SGD with spoken peer input only (SPT&#xD;
      Basic; peers taught to model language) or SPT and SGD with augmented peer input (SPT Plus;&#xD;
      peers taught to use verbal language models concurrently with the SGD). Each child's response&#xD;
      to treatment after 5 weeks will determine that child's next phase in the SMART design.&#xD;
      Children showing a positive response will continue in their originally assigned group; slow&#xD;
      responders will be randomly assigned to receive added treatment components to improve&#xD;
      communication (either SPT Plus or SPT Advanced). SPT Advanced adds direct instruction&#xD;
      strategies (i.e., adult prompts, reinforcers, and teaching trials) to increase child&#xD;
      vocalizations in SGD interventions. The use of a SMART design extends our prior work by&#xD;
      testing the systematic addition of selected peer-mediated strategies in combination with an&#xD;
      SGD that allows for flexible application of interventions based on child response. The&#xD;
      investigators have assembled an outstanding team of highly qualified investigators with&#xD;
      complementary skills in preschool assessment, language intervention, clinical trials, and&#xD;
      statistics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The research questions in this proposal will be evaluated using a Sequential Multiple&#xD;
      Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART). This design allows for evaluation of adaptations to&#xD;
      interventions based on a tailoring variable that triggers early or slow child response status&#xD;
      at an important decision point - in this study, 5 weeks after start of treatment. Children&#xD;
      showing a positive response continue in their originally assigned group; those who are slow&#xD;
      responders will be re-randomized to receive added treatment components to improve&#xD;
      communication (i.e., either SPT Plus or SPT Advanced). The proposed study will include two&#xD;
      research sites, with N=132 preschoolers with ASD (ages of 3-6 years), and up to N=264 peers&#xD;
      recruited through (1) Juniper Gardens Children's Project, University of Kansas, and (2) the&#xD;
      Marcus Autism Center, Emory University. The investigators plan to recruit 66 children with&#xD;
      ASD per research site in five cohorts over five years. Two peers without disabilities will be&#xD;
      recruited for each child (N=264). Four measures will be administered at enrollment: (1) the&#xD;
      Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule-2, (2) the Preschool-Language Scale-5 to assess&#xD;
      children's expressive and receptive language, and (3) the Mullen Scales of Early Learning to&#xD;
      assess verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills, and (4) the Aberrant Behavior Checklist. SGD&#xD;
      Access and General Procedures. All children will receive an iPad with Touch Chat app as an&#xD;
      SGD to use for the duration of the study. If a child has an SGD, it will be used. The&#xD;
      investigators will recommend SGD access across the school day. The investigators will track&#xD;
      any concurrent therapies (e.g., speech, behavior therapy) the child receives. Each focal&#xD;
      child's caregiver will be asked to complete a preference assessment e.g., toys, TV shows),&#xD;
      with monthly monitoring to identify highly preferred stimuli. Prior to baseline,&#xD;
      participating school staff will attend a 1-hour training on: (1) study timeline and&#xD;
      expectations, (2) peer recruitment, (3) setting up child-preferred activities, and (4)&#xD;
      programming the iPad. A minimum of four communicative functions (i.e., request, comment, gain&#xD;
      attention, or protest) will be programmed on each vocabulary page on the iPad. The&#xD;
      investigators will work with school staff to create symbol vocabularies based on&#xD;
      individualized education plans. School staff will not be aware of group assignment at the&#xD;
      time of training and will be informed after baseline data are collected. Baseline Procedures.&#xD;
      The investigators will schedule three baseline observations. One child with ASD and one peer&#xD;
      will be at a table for a 10-min play activity over three different days. Children will be&#xD;
      instructed to stay together and play, with the iPad programmed to match the play activity. No&#xD;
      adult prompts are provided. Design. The research questions will be evaluated using a&#xD;
      Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design. This design allows for&#xD;
      evaluation of first and second stage adaptations to interventions based on a tailoring&#xD;
      variable that triggers early or slow child response status at an important decision point -&#xD;
      in this study, 5 weeks after the start of treatment. Participants (N=132 preschoolers with&#xD;
      ASD) will be initially randomized to Stay-Play-Talk (SPT) with spoken peer input only (SPT&#xD;
      Basic; peers taught to model language) or SPT and SGD with augmented peer input (SPT Plus;&#xD;
      peers taught to use verbal language models while selecting SGD icons). Each child's response&#xD;
      to treatment after 5 weeks will determine that child's next phase in the SMART design.&#xD;
      Children showing a positive response will continue in their originally assigned group; those&#xD;
      who are slow responders will be randomly assigned to receive added treatment components to&#xD;
      improve communication. SPT Advanced adds direct instruction strategies (i.e., adult prompts,&#xD;
      reinforcers, and teaching trials). Follow Up Procedures. At Week 20 (5 weeks post treatment),&#xD;
      all primary and secondary child communication variables will be collected during three 10-min&#xD;
      play sessions with activities similar to baseline and no adult prompts. Similar models will&#xD;
      determine if differences due to treatment arm or experiencing augmented input are maintained&#xD;
      at the 20-week follow-up direct observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Child Predictors to Treatment Response. The investigators will explore if child variables&#xD;
      (i.e., receptive language, nonverbal intelligence, and peer engagement) assessed at baseline&#xD;
      predict peer-directed communication gains in response to first stage PMI after 5 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment and adapted PMI treatments after 15 weeks of treatment for all children regardless&#xD;
      of condition, as described in the Statistical Design plan. Fidelity Procedures. Treatment&#xD;
      fidelity will be monitored for (1) adult implementation of peer training, (2) peer&#xD;
      implementation with focal child, and (3) staff implementation of steps for each PMI&#xD;
      condition. To monitor adherence to the treatment protocol and identify peers or implementers&#xD;
      who may need more support, fidelity will be collected for 25% of randomly selected treatment&#xD;
      sessions in all treatment stages. If a peer or implementer falls below 70% fidelity over two&#xD;
      sessions, a 20-min refresher session will be provided. Coding Communication Variables. All&#xD;
      peer-directed communication and engagement variables will be primary coded from videos at the&#xD;
      KU research lab to minimize potential site differences, using Noldus Observer XT software.&#xD;
      Two KU research assistants will be primary coders and deemed reliable after achieving 80%&#xD;
      inter-rater reliability with the PI or project coordinator (PC) on a minimum of three gold&#xD;
      standard vignettes across child initiations and responses, communicative functions and&#xD;
      modalities, and reciprocal exchanges; one student assistant will be kept blind to condition&#xD;
      and code 30% of sessions for reliability. This coder will also be trained to transcribe&#xD;
      language samples using Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts (SALT) for total number of&#xD;
      different words, mean length of utterance, and unique word combinations. During Week 5,&#xD;
      coding of child communication to determine responder status will occur within three days for&#xD;
      timely decision-making to re-randomize children to second stage treatment. Training on CGI-I.&#xD;
      Drs. Scahill and Boyd will train independent evaluators (IEs) at each site on the CGI-I and&#xD;
      Parent Target Problem narratives using clinical vignettes. Training will include presentation&#xD;
      of a clinical vignette to illustrate interpretation of frequency counts of spontaneous&#xD;
      peer-directed communication, PTP narratives and scores on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist&#xD;
      (ABC) subscales (Irritability, Social Withdrawal, Hyperactivity) rated by the child's&#xD;
      teacher. Given that the CGI-I is a key secondary measure, the investigators will set rigorous&#xD;
      standards for agreement with gold standard ratings established by Drs. Scahill and Boyd&#xD;
      (perfect agreement on 3 and within one unit on the fourth). The CGI-I resolves to a&#xD;
      dichotomous outcome: positive (Much Improved or Very Much Improved) or negative response (all&#xD;
      other ratings). Therefore, a disagreement by one unit on the CGI-I is acceptable if it would&#xD;
      not affect classification on treatment response. An IE who does not meet reliability criteria&#xD;
      will receive additional training and given additional vignettes to achieve reliability.&#xD;
      Following training to reliability, Dr. Scahill will review the PTP baseline narratives for&#xD;
      the first 10 subjects at each site and provide feedback to the IE. Drs. Scahill and Boyd will&#xD;
      convene monthly review sessions. On a rotating basis, IEs will present the CGI-I scores on&#xD;
      completed cases, as well as the clinical material that formed the basis of the CGI-I ratings.&#xD;
      The purpose of these review sessions is to foster a common approach to scoring the CGI-I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interobserver Agreement. The KU project coordinator will train two research assistants (RAs)&#xD;
      kept blind to treatment condition, to a criterion of 80% interobserver agreement for all&#xD;
      primary and secondary child variables using the gold standard videos created to train primary&#xD;
      coders. The RAs will be considered reliable once they meet 80% interobserver reliability&#xD;
      across variables on three different videos. A minimum of 30% of videos will be randomly&#xD;
      selected for reliability coding from each of the four measurement periods, for both research&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analyses. A series of multilevel models with occasions nested within children will be&#xD;
      used to compare changes in peer-directed communication and other language outcomes from&#xD;
      baseline to Week 5 in children randomly assigned to the SPT Basic condition with changes in&#xD;
      children assigned to the SPT Plus condition (Aim 1a). The investigators will also compare&#xD;
      changes in outcomes over the 15 week two-stage intervention for non-responders in each of the&#xD;
      four adaptive interventions. Planned pairwise comparisons will enable us to examine which&#xD;
      condition/s were most effective at eliciting a treatment response (Aim 1b). Because The&#xD;
      investigators are especially interested in the impact of SPT Plus, the investigators will&#xD;
      determine whether experiencing that intervention - regardless of the stage - has an impact on&#xD;
      intercepts or slopes for child communication and language outcomes. Finally, the&#xD;
      investigators will use t-tests to compare baseline predictor variable levels for children&#xD;
      identified as early responders or slow responders at Week 5. The investigators will also&#xD;
      determine if early and slow responders at Week 15, the end of intervention, differ in&#xD;
      baseline predictor characteristics. The second way the investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      predictor variables is to determine if any of them are related to intercept and slopes when&#xD;
      treatment group is not a part of the model. More details about the modeling process and a&#xD;
      basic equation are provided in the Statistical Design and Power data analysis plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing data and Power. Maximum likelihood estimation will be used to include all available&#xD;
      data in a multidimensional likelihood function such that no imputation will be needed. Power&#xD;
      simulation conducted within SAS indicates that there is ample power for the models to be&#xD;
      conducted in Aims 1a, 1c, and 2. While Aim 1b is more limited in power, the parameter&#xD;
      estimates obtained from these models are crucial for taking the next steps in developing&#xD;
      adaptive interventions for this population. Power curves are provided in the data plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Problems and Strategies. It is possible that some preschool-age peers may have&#xD;
      difficulty implementing procedures with adequate fidelity. The investigators are confident&#xD;
      that our comprehensive peer recruitment criteria, prior peer implementation fidelity average&#xD;
      of 80% (based on fidelity data from 235 treatment sessions), and using similar procedures to&#xD;
      provide booster training as necessary all support the feasibility of the planned peer&#xD;
      training component. It is possible that some children with ASD will attend the same&#xD;
      preschool. If this occurs, the investigators will ensure that school staff do not discuss&#xD;
      what condition they are in and implement treatment in different locations. Joint lab meetings&#xD;
      will be conducted twice per month, with close monitoring of treatment conditions to ensure a&#xD;
      high-level of implementation fidelity for adults and peers. The PI will monitor data&#xD;
      collection and entry to ensure it is aggregated consistently across sites.&#xD;
