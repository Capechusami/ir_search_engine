  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The disproportionately low physical activity (PA) in Latinas, particularly&#xD;
      muscle-strengthening activities, and related chronic diseases (e.g., obesity, diabetes,&#xD;
      cancer) signifies an urgent public health concern. To address the lack of interventions&#xD;
      promoting muscle-strengthening activities exclusively for Latinas, the investigators are&#xD;
      testing the preliminary efficacy of a culturally and linguistically relevant, web-based&#xD;
      aerobic plus muscle-strengthening PA intervention in this at-risk population. The web-based&#xD;
      intervention provides a more comprehensive and highly disseminable approach for reducing&#xD;
      PA-related health disparities in Latinas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is the leading cause of death among Latinos in the U.S. While engaging in a physically&#xD;
      active lifestyle is one of the most important modifiable behaviors for reducing cancer risk;&#xD;
      few Latinas achieve health-enhancing levels of physical activity (PA) recommended by the&#xD;
      National PA Guidelines, particularly for muscle strengthening activities (MSA). For instance,&#xD;
      44% of Latinas meet the national guidelines for aerobic PA but only 17% meet the full&#xD;
      guidelines for both aerobic and MSA. While the benefits of aerobic MVPA are well established&#xD;
      for cancer and chronic disease prevention, participating in regular MSA may be key to further&#xD;
      reducing cancer risk, as adherence to MSA guidelines has been associated with a 19% to 31%&#xD;
      lower cancer mortality risk, independent of aerobic PA. There is a need for interventions&#xD;
      promoting MSA in Latinas. However, only a select few MSA interventions have included Latinas&#xD;
      in their sample, and none to the investigators' knowledge, were designed exclusively for this&#xD;
      population or addressed socio-cultural factors influencing Latinas' muscle strengthening&#xD;
      behaviors (e.g., perception that MSA is for men; MSA is an avoided topic in their culture and&#xD;
      social circles; belief that women should only do certain types of MSA). Moreover, existing&#xD;
      interventions often involved in-person exercise programs, which can be inaccessible to many&#xD;
      Latinas due to barriers such as lack of transportation or fear of immigration enforcement.&#xD;
      The research team has previously developed and tested aerobic moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA)&#xD;
      interventions for Latinas that overcome barriers to in-person programs and address PA-related&#xD;
      socio-cultural factors. These theory-driven, individually tailored interventions have shown&#xD;
      success at increasing aerobic MVPA among Latina women in both print and Internet-based&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials, and now provide an ideal platform for promoting MSA in this&#xD;
      at-risk population. To address the gap in literature on MSA, the investigators recently&#xD;
      conducted qualitative interviews with 19 Latinas to identify theory-based barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators of muscle strengthening PA, then developed MSA intervention materials and&#xD;
      further refined them for cultural appropriateness, relevance, and appeal in Latinas. In the&#xD;
      proposed research, the investigators will incorporate the newly developed MSA promotion&#xD;
      materials into the existing web-based aerobic MVPA intervention and conduct a 12-week fully&#xD;
      online randomized pilot trial testing the preliminary efficacy of the newly adapted web-based&#xD;
      aerobic plus MSA intervention for Latinas. Fifty Latina adults (i.e., aged 18-65 years) will&#xD;
      be randomized to either the: 1) original aerobic MVPA intervention arm, or 2) aerobic MVPA&#xD;
      plus MSA intervention arm. This study aims to: 1) Assess the preliminary efficacy of the&#xD;
      aerobic plus MSA intervention for increasing MSA, and 2) Explore potential mediators and&#xD;
      moderators of MSA. This interactive and highly disseminable approach can achieve significant&#xD;
      health improvements in an at-risk population.&#xD;
