  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim is to conduct a double blind randomized clinical trial, to study the&#xD;
      effects of Acetyl-L-Carnitine and folic acid versus Coenzyme Q10 and folic acid on Semen and&#xD;
      hormonal parameters and semen oxidative stress in patients of Primary infertility. Males&#xD;
      diagnosed with Primary Infertility are recruited in the study after fulfilling the inclusion&#xD;
      nd exclusion criteria. The investigators propose that Primary infertile men may have altered&#xD;
      seminal oxidative status &amp; the combinational therapy may achieve favorable seminal ,&#xD;
      hormonal&amp; antioxidant levels in men having Primary infertility.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historically, male infertility was considered a taboo subject and its role was deliberately&#xD;
      kept in dark until recently when with advances in medical science, the issue was highlighted&#xD;
      and its role came into limelight in couple's infertility. Male infertility is mainly caused&#xD;
      by oxidative stress. O2- (superoxide anion), OH- (hydroxyl ions), H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide),&#xD;
      nitric oxide &amp; ROO- (peroxyl) radicals are all oxygen derived highly reactive oxygen species&#xD;
      with a free unpaired electron in their outer orbit making them short lived, highly reactive &amp;&#xD;
      unstable. They are produced by the sperms &amp; their normal level help in the sperm maturation,&#xD;
      motility, capacitation &amp; facilitation of fertilization. Sperms are at risk of the damage&#xD;
      caused by overproduction of these ions. Several factors have been implicated in the&#xD;
      overproduction of these reactive oxygen species which include men with testicular&#xD;
      hyperthermia (varicocoele, cooks, and drivers) &amp; overproduction by immature sperms &amp;&#xD;
      leucocytes. Their overproduction cause damage to the DNA and peroxidation of the lipid&#xD;
      membrane leading to detrimental effects on sperms causing infertility There has been no&#xD;
      consensus on treatment of male infertility in literature. No standardized treatment is&#xD;
      suggested and different treatment combinations are currently been used to manage male&#xD;
      infertility. The role of CoQ10 &amp; Acetyl- L-Carnitine is explored recently in the different&#xD;
      studies with no consensus on their dosage, duration of treatment &amp; their effect on serum&#xD;
      testosterone. This study is conducted to find out the role of Acetyl- L-Carnitine and Co&#xD;
      enzyme Q 10 in combination with folic acid and their effect on semen parameters, semen&#xD;
      oxidative stress &amp; serum testosterone level in treating primary infertile men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To find the effects of Acetyl-l-Carnitine and folic acid versus Coenzyme Q10 and&#xD;
      folic acid therapy on sperm parameters, seminal oxidative status &amp; serum testosterone level&#xD;
      in primary infertility male patients.&#xD;
