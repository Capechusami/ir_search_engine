  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational study is to describe the immune signature of acute pulmonary&#xD;
      infection.The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Nasal mucosal immune response in patients with influenza infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Difference of immune response between Viral sepsis and Bacterial sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Immunological differences between Viral sepsis and Viral pneumonia&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      1. Aging could influence host immune response. Elderly people are more likely to progress&#xD;
           to severe pneumonia than young people. Nasal mucosa is the initial infection site of&#xD;
           influenza infection. Single cell sequencing of nasal mucosal cell that may provide&#xD;
           valuable insights into host response to influenza infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to&#xD;
           infection. Although bacteria are considered as the main pathgens of sepsis，SARS-CoV-2 or&#xD;
           influenza infection also can cause multiple organ dysfunction which meet the definition&#xD;
           of Sepsis 3.0. Viral sepsis has not received enough attention for a long time. It is&#xD;
           important to understand the difference between viral sepsis and bacterial sepsis that&#xD;
           may help to develop better strategies to diagnose and treat sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Viral pneumonia is one of the leading infectious cause of death woldwide.Pneumina is the&#xD;
           most common cause of sepsis.The mechanism of viral pneumonia progressing to sepsis needs&#xD;
           to be further investigated.&#xD;

    <description>This cohort aims to descirbe the nasal mucosal immune response in influenza patients. We will collect nasal mucosal cells from influenza patients using Nasal Cytology Curettes. Blood samples will also be obtained from the patient. All samples will be used for single cell sequencing.</description>

    <description>The purpose of this cohort is to characterize the immune pattern of patients with viral sepsis and find specific target for the treatment of viral sepsis. Blood samples will be obtained from the viral sepsis/pneumonia patients.All samples will be used for transcriptome sequencing.</description>
