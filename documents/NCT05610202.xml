    <textblock>
      This project is an open, dose escalation and expansion phase I clinical study. The first&#xD;
      phase is a dose escalation study, and the second phase is a dose expansion study based on the&#xD;
      Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) obtained in the first phase.&#xD;
      The purpose is to evaluate the tolerability and preliminary efficacy of TQB3702 tablets in&#xD;
      hematological tumor subjects.&#xD;
