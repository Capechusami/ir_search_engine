  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is aimed at advancing neuropsychological diagnostics, enriching and modernizing&#xD;
      the panorama of both clinical and forensic psychometric testing. The rapid socio-demographic&#xD;
      changes, the developments of neuropsychological semiotics and nosography, as well as the&#xD;
      growing applicative specialization of neuropsychological assessment make it necessary to&#xD;
      introduce further tools to satisfy the diagnostic requests in clinical contexts and more&#xD;
      recently in the forensic field (i.e., tests to be administered remotely; bedside screeners;&#xD;
      domain-specific in-depth tests; tools for assessing testamentary capacity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the present study aims to: a) develop, calibrate and evaluate the psychometric&#xD;
      properties of I and II level clinical and/or forensic neuropsychological tests evaluating&#xD;
      instrumental and non-instrumental functions in a sample of neurologically healthy individuals&#xD;
      representative of the Italian population ; b) evaluate the cross-sectional and longitudinal&#xD;
      clinical usability of the aforementioned tests in clinical samples (patients with&#xD;
      neurological and neuropsychiatric pathologies of different etiology).&#xD;
