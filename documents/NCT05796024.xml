  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop a novel surgical risk stratification tool designed to&#xD;
      adults operated in Brazil. The main question it aims to answer is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Is the Extended Care (Ex-Care) II model a good tool to assess the risk of death among&#xD;
      patients operated in Brazilian hospitals within 30 days after surgery?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information of patients undergoing surgery in the participating hospitals over a period of 24&#xD;
      months will be analyzed to evaluate the relationship of some patients characteristics (called&#xD;
      predictors) with the study outcome (probability of death).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will be divided in two groups. The first, called derivation sample, will be used&#xD;
      for the development of the Ex-Care II model. The second, called validation sample, will&#xD;
      evaluate the performance of this new model.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From four predictors collected preoperatively ( American Society of Anesthesiology Physical&#xD;
      Status (ASA-PS) classification, age, extent of surgery and its nature - elective vs&#xD;
      urgency/emergency), through a multilevel logistic regression, a post-surgical in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality prediction model will be developed, the Ex-Care II model. Discrimination and&#xD;
      calibration measures will be used to determine the accuracy of the model. In addition, each&#xD;
      predictor will have their odds ratio calculated for the study outcome. Once this model is&#xD;
      developed, it will have its external validity tested in a second sample, using the same&#xD;
      accuracy metrics.&#xD;

    <description>From four predictors collected preoperatively, the developed model will be able to estimate the probability of in-hospital death of patients undergoing surgery in Brazilian hospitals. For the creation of this tool, multilevel logistic regression will be made with hospital as a random effect</description>
