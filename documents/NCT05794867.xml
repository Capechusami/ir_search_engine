  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      compare and evaluate the effect of use of ultrasonic criteria of weaning versus the&#xD;
      conventional ways of weaning in post-traumatic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;
      patients who were ventilated for a long time. And compare their effect on the duration of ICU&#xD;
      stay.&#xD;

      It is a prospective double blind study done on total 200 patients. Who were weaned from&#xD;
      ventilator after being ventilated for &gt; one week due to respiratory failure. This respiratory&#xD;
      failure was selected in our study to be from severe lung contusion and post-traumatic acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome. Patients were randomly allocated in one of two groups each&#xD;
      group contain 100 patients. Group A considered control group. Those patients weaned from the&#xD;
      ventilator by the conventional criteria of weaning. While group B weaned from the ventilator&#xD;
      by the ultrasound criteria of weaning. All patients weaned from both groups followed for six&#xD;
      days for signs of failure of weaning ,signs of post-extubation respiratory failure. And&#xD;
      number of patients who were re-ventilated and who discharged from ICU in both groups recorded&#xD;
      and compared.&#xD;
