  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to explore the optimal dose and administration of the&#xD;
      experimental drug, and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug in patients with renal&#xD;
      anemia. Patients with renal anemia on regular dialysis treatment are expected to be enrolled&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, positive controlled phase II clinical&#xD;
      study. A total of 125 to 150 patients with renal anemia receiving regular dialysis were&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. Those patients were randomly allocated to 5 treatment groups in a&#xD;
      ratio of 1:1:1:1:1, with 25 to 30 patients in each group.&#xD;
