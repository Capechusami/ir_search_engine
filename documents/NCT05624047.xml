    <textblock>
      This study aimed to determine the effect of breastfeeding education given to pregnant women&#xD;
      by a hybrid simulation method in the antenatal period on postpartum breastfeeding. This study&#xD;
      will be carried out in a family health center in Turkey. Breastfeeding education will be&#xD;
      given to pregnant women using a hybrid simulation method consisting of a wearable breast&#xD;
      model and the standard patient in the intervention group. Women in the control group will&#xD;
      receive only routine breastfeeding education.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research will be conducted as a randomized controlled trial. The stratified block&#xD;
      randomization methods will be used to assign women to the intervention and control groups.&#xD;
      The personal information form and Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale Short Form (Antenatal)&#xD;
      will be implemented to all women before the intervention. Breastfeeding education will be&#xD;
      given to pregnant women using a hybrid simulation method consisting of a wearable breast&#xD;
      model and the standard patient to support women in breastfeeding and to ensure the continuity&#xD;
      of breastfeeding in the postpartum period. Breastfeeding education will be given to women in&#xD;
      the 32-36 weeks of pregnancy in the antenatal period. The control group will be received the&#xD;
      routine antenatal breastfeeding education given to all women by healthcare personnel as part&#xD;
      of the family health center procedures. The Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale Short Form&#xD;
      (Postnatal) and the LATCH Breastfeeding Assessment Tool will be administered to women in both&#xD;
      the experimental and control groups within the postpartum fifth days and at sixth week&#xD;
      postpartum.&#xD;

    <description>The LATCH Breastfeeding Assesment Tool was developed to objectively evaluate breastfeeding success. LATCH consists of five evaluation criteria. Each criterion is evaluated between 0-2 points. The lowest score that can be obtained from the entire scale is 0 and the highest score is 10. The higher score indicates a higher breastfeeding. success.</description>
