  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was planned to examine the effects of robot-assisted walking training supported by virtual&#xD;
      reality on cognitive functions, quality of life and activities of daily living in individuals&#xD;
      with subacute stroke. In this context, only conventional physiotherapy was applied to one&#xD;
      group, while the other group was given exercises with Lokomat in addition to conventional&#xD;
      physiotherapy.&#xD;

      According to the definition of the World Health Organization, stroke is a clinical syndrome&#xD;
      characterized by the rapid establishment of signs and symptoms of focal loss of cerebral&#xD;
      function for no apparent reason other than vascular causes. Symptoms last longer than&#xD;
      twenty-four hours or may result in death. Stroke is the second leading cause of death in the&#xD;
      world and the first cause of disability and loss of work force. Many stroke survivors are&#xD;
      dependent on someone else for some part of their daily lives, have limitations in their daily&#xD;
      and social activities, and have significantly lost their quality of life. Cognitive disorders&#xD;
      after stroke are manifested by difficulties in information processing due to brain damage.&#xD;
      The most common cognitive effects in stroke; attention, memory, orientation, executive&#xD;
      dysfunction and aphasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cognitive rehabilitation it is known that Lokomat combined virtual reality applications&#xD;
      is more effective than Lokomat exercises without virtual reality in individuals with chronic&#xD;
      stroke. Our research aims to contribute to the literature by revealing the cognitive&#xD;
      functions, ADL and quality of life of locomotive exercises together with virtual reality in&#xD;
      individuals with subacute stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research will be carried out in the Robotic Rehabilitation Laboratory of Physical Therapy&#xD;
      and Rehabilitation Hospital in Ankara City Hospital. The population of the study is the&#xD;
      stroke clinics of the same hospital. Individuals with subacute stroke who volunteered to&#xD;
      participate in the study will be included in the study. All patients will receive&#xD;
      conventional physiotherapy five days a week for six weeks, and the study group will receive&#xD;
      with Lokomat three times a week in addition to conventional physiotherapy. The patients will&#xD;
      be evaluated by a therapist other than the practitioner before and after the treatment in two&#xD;
      groups, one of which is the study group and the other is the control group.&#xD;

    <description>Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (Lawton&amp;Brody Score) consists of 8 questions covering activities such as using the phone, shopping, using public transport, doing daily housework, preparing meals, and traveling. If the patient score is between 0-8 points, fully dependent, between 9-16 points semi-dependent, between 17-24 points is considered fully independent.</description>

    <description>The Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale is specially designed for stroke patients. It consists of 49 items covering 12 domains that measure quality of life. It measures in many fields such as upper extremity functions, visual functions, speech, domestic roles, social roles, mobility, psychological state, work productivity, self-care, perception, memory, and personality. High scores indicate better quality of life. The maximum score is 245.</description>
