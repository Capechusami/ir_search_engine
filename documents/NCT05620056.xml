      The DEEP cohort is the first population-based cohort of pregnant population in China that&#xD;
      longitudinally documents drug uses throughout the pregnancy life course and adverse pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes. The main goal of the study aims to monitor and evaluate the safety of drug use&#xD;
      through the pregnancy life course in the Chinese setting. The DEEP cohort is developed&#xD;
      primarily based on the population-based data platforms in Xiamen, a municipal city of 5&#xD;
      million population in southeast China. Based on these data platforms, a pregnancy-centered&#xD;
      registry was developed that documented health care services and outcomes in the maternal and&#xD;
      other departments. For identifying drug uses, a drug prescription database was specifically&#xD;
      developed by using electronic healthcare records documented in the platforms across the&#xD;
      primary, secondary and tertiary hospitals. By linking the pregnancy registry and prescription&#xD;
      database through a unique identifier, the DEEP cohort was developed. All the pregnant women&#xD;
      and their offspring in Xiamen are provided with health care and followed up according to&#xD;
      standard protocols in the region, including antenatal care, delivery care, postpartum&#xD;
      follow-up and childhood follow-ups. The primary adverse outcomes - congenital malformations -&#xD;
      are collected using a standardized Case Report Form.&#xD;
