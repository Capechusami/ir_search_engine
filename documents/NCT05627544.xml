    <textblock>
      Introduction and Aim In the intraoperative or postoperative period of hip replacement&#xD;
      surgeries, approximately 46% of patients receive erythrocyte transfusion. 'Patient blood&#xD;
      management' protocols have been established in order to reduce the frequency of perioperative&#xD;
      surgical bleeding and transfusion. The aim of this study is to evaluate the patients who&#xD;
      underwent hip replacement by the same experienced surgeon; to evaluate retrospectively in&#xD;
      terms of patient characteristics, surgical and anesthesia management, blood transfusion&#xD;
      frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The characteristics of patients who underwent hip replacement (total hip replacement,&#xD;
      revision hip replacement, partial hip replacement) operation by the same experienced surgeon&#xD;
      between 2010-2022 at Baskent University after the approval of Baskent University Medical and&#xD;
      Health Sciences Research Board, results will be analyzed retrospectively through&#xD;
      perioperative follow-up forms and review of patient files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expectations and scientific contributions Preparing patients for surgery, determining the&#xD;
      causes of blood loss during and after surgery and creating preventive strategies are&#xD;
      important for all operations, especially hip replacement surgeries. While determining the&#xD;
      strategies, the main aim should be to see the pre-, intra- and post-operative period as a&#xD;
      whole, to determine the transfusion risks according to the comorbidities and anemia of the&#xD;
      patients, and to determine the anesthesia and analgesia managements that reduce blood loss in&#xD;
      the intraoperative and postoperative periods.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction and Aim Hip replacement surgeries are among the operations whose frequency is&#xD;
      increasing in our country and in the world. In these operations, procedures such as soft&#xD;
      tissue dissection, exposing the hypervascular metaphysis and bone resection cause acute blood&#xD;
      loss and continue in the form of leakage in the postoperative period. It has been reported&#xD;
      that the rate of blood transfusion in hip operations in the United States is between 18-68%.&#xD;
      There are studies reporting that erythrocyte transfusion rate approximately 46% of these&#xD;
      cases in the intraoperative or postoperative period. Various complications may develop in&#xD;
      patients during or after blood transfusion. These complications include local or systemic&#xD;
      infections, venous thromboembolic events, allergic reactions, circulatory overload,&#xD;
      transfusion-induced acute lung injury, morbidity, mortality, and increased hospital stay. In&#xD;
      addition, a significant increase in cost can be seen. It is thought that the amount of&#xD;
      bleeding varies according to the duration of the operation, the experience of the surgeon,&#xD;
      and the type of surgery. Therefore, it is important for patient safety to reduce surgical&#xD;
      bleeding and avoid transfusion applications as much as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Patient blood management&quot; has been defined as, to reduce the frequency of perioperative&#xD;
      surgical bleeding and transfusion. Perioperative patient blood management practices,&#xD;
      correction of preoperative anemia, autologous blood donation, discontinuation of blood&#xD;
      thinners, acute normovolemic hemodilution, use of tranexamic acid, regional anesthesia,&#xD;
      controlled hypotension, avoidance of hypothermia, appropriate fluid management, meticulous&#xD;
      surgery, appropriate hemostasis, patient position, postoperative drain strategy. 'Patient&#xD;
      blood management' measures are actively applied in hip replacement surgeries, which are one&#xD;
      of the major orthopedic surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the patients who underwent hip replacement by the same&#xD;
      experienced surgeon in this center; to evaluate retrospectively in terms of patient&#xD;
      characteristics, surgical and anesthesia management, blood transfusion frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The characteristics of patients who underwent hip replacement (total hip replacement,&#xD;
      revision hip replacement, partial hip replacement) operation by the same experienced surgeon&#xD;
      between 2010-2022 at Baskent University after the approval of Baskent University Medical and&#xD;
      Health Sciences Research Board, It will be analyzed retrospectively through perioperative&#xD;
      follow-up forms and review of patient files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From preoperative records; Demographic data (Age, sex, height, body weight), diagnoses (Hip&#xD;
      arthrosis, hip revision, hip fracture, congenital hip dislocation, infected hip replacement&#xD;
      revision), American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Condition Classification (ASA),&#xD;
      co-morbidities (Hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney failure, hepatopathy, inflammatory&#xD;
      disease), smoking, alcohol, antiplatelet/anticoagulant, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory use&#xD;
      (NSAII), opioid, herbal medicine use, antiplatelet cut-off time compliance, hemoglobin (Hb),&#xD;
      hematocrit (Htc), leukocytes, thrombocyte, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT),&#xD;
      prothrombin time (PTZ), international normalized ratio (INR), preoperative erythrocyte (ES)&#xD;
      transfusion/amount.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From intraoperative records; Year of operation, mallampati score, type of operation, duration&#xD;
      of operation, whether emergency or elective, duration of anesthesia, type of anesthesia,&#xD;
      intraoperative blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), heart rate, peripheral oxygen&#xD;
      saturation, amount/type of fluid administered, ES transfusion/ amount, Hb when transfused,&#xD;
      drugs used for anesthesia and analgesia and their amount, amount of blood in the aspirator,&#xD;
      administration of tranexamic acid, amount of intraoperative urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the postoperative records; Hb/Htc values, ES transfusion/amount/day of administration,&#xD;
      use of drain, amount of blood in the drain, amount of postoperative urine, intensive care&#xD;
      unit admission, initiation of anticoagulants, early and late complications (Atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, pneumonia , renal failure, prosthesis infection, allergic reactions,&#xD;
      nausea-vomiting), postoperative analgesia (Epidural/intravenous patient-controlled analgesia,&#xD;
      opioid and NSAID use), Hb, urea, creatinine values at postoperative 6th and 12th hours and at&#xD;
      discharge, iron preparation use, The number of hospitalization days and the mortality within&#xD;
      7 days will be recorded and the data will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS (SPSS Inc. Chicago,&#xD;
      Illinois, USA) version 20.0 of the statistical program. Descriptive statistical methods&#xD;
      (frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation) will be used while evaluating the study&#xD;
      data. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be used to evaluate the conformity of the data of the&#xD;
      patients with and without ES transfusion to normal distribution. T-test will be used in the&#xD;
      analysis of data suitable for normal distribution, Kruskal-Wallis test or Mann Whitney U test&#xD;
      will be used in the analysis of data not suitable for normal distribution. XÂ² will be used in&#xD;
      the analysis of qualitative or counted data. p&lt;0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expectations and scientific contributions Preparing patients for surgery, determining the&#xD;
      causes of blood loss during and after surgery and creating preventive strategies are&#xD;
      important for all operations, especially hip replacement surgeries. While determining the&#xD;
      strategies, the main aim should be to see the pre-, intra- and post-operative period as a&#xD;

      patients, and to determine the anesthesia and analgesia managements that reduce blood loss in&#xD;
      the intraoperative and postoperative periods. With this study, it is aimed to both update the&#xD;
      practice and contribute to the literature by examining the operations performed by the same&#xD;
      experienced surgeon and testing the effectiveness and safety of the strategies applied.&#xD;
