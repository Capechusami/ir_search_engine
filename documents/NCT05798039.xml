    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of the proposed study is to develop and test an enrichment to&#xD;
      Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) using an existing, evidence-based program to improve clients'&#xD;
      and their children's cardiovascular health from early pregnancy to 24 months postpartum. With&#xD;
      support from NFP supervisors and nurses, the investigators will develop new NFP materials&#xD;
      promoting healthy diet, activity, sleep, and smoking behaviors, along with optimal weight,&#xD;
      glycemia, lipid, and blood pressure profiles. The investigators will conduct a pilot study&#xD;
      with 40 prenatal or postpartum NFP clients and their nurses to determine feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the materials and study protocol.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Diet will be assessed with 24-hour dietary recalls using the Automated Self-Administered system (ASA24). This system uses the USDA multiple-pass method to query all foods and supplements consumed in the prior 24 hours and produces daily and individual food estimates for macronutrients, micronutrients, and MyPyramid Equivalents (such as servings of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, solid fats, and added sugars)</description>

    <measure>Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ), while adjusting metabolic task equivalents for pregnancy. Investigators will calculate average activity intensity (sedentary to vigorous) and type (household, occupational, exercise, transportation) over the past 3 months at collection point. Physical activity outcomes include daily minutes of sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, household, occupational, exercise, transportation activity.</description>

    <measure>Smoking frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked about lifetime and recent (past 6 months) usage of cigarette and marijuana. Smoking outcomes include any smoking in pregnancy (binary) and number of cigarettes (total, trimester-specific).</description>

    <time_frame>Enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using a sleep questionnaire developed and validated by the NIH Patient Report Outcome Information System (PROMIS), adapted for this study. This form queries daytime and nighttime sleep start times, stop times, and duration, and also collect data on sleep disturbances and sleep-related impairments (trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, number of nighttime awakenings, feeling refreshed upon waking, etc.).</description>
