  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a fast-growing and devastating epidemic in the US with many&#xD;
      mothers suffering cravings, depression, impaired interpersonal interactions and maladaptive&#xD;
      parenting behaviors that may lead to child maltreatment and costly utilization of foster&#xD;
      care. This interdisciplinary multisite project will begin with the high risk R61 phase, in&#xD;
      which the investigators will administer the parenting intervention &quot;Mom Power&quot; to mothers&#xD;
      with OUD during the first 6 months postpartum and look for effects on drug use, mood and&#xD;
      brain mechanisms; and, If validated, the investigators will continue in the R33 with more&#xD;
      brain mechanism investigation and outcome studies a larger sample. The completion of this&#xD;
      grant will clarify the effects of parenting intervention for mothers with OUD, and yield&#xD;
      brain-based biomarkers that may be connected with inexpensive measures toward improved&#xD;
      treatment of families suffering OUD, their children and society - which ultimately bears much&#xD;
      of the cost for the common trans-generational problems of peripartum drug use.&#xD;

      Postpartum Intervention for Mothers with Opioid Use Disorders - Brain-Behavior Mechanisms&#xD;
      Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a fast-growing and devastating epidemic in the US with many&#xD;
      suffering comorbid mood disorders. Despite receiving &quot;gold standard&quot; buprenorphine treatment&#xD;
      to reduce withdrawal, OUD mothers still suffer have cravings, depression, impaired&#xD;
      interpersonal interactions and maladaptive parenting behaviors that may lead to child&#xD;
      maltreatment and costly utilization of foster care. Parenting interventions have been&#xD;
      established to improve parent mood and sensitive caregiving behaviors for high-risk non-OUD&#xD;
      populations. &quot;Mom Power&quot; (MP) is an evidence-based 13-session psychosocial mother-child&#xD;
      intervention established to enhance emotionally sensitive caregiving, while concurrently&#xD;
      reducing parental stress and depression for non-OUD mothers. The investigators have&#xD;
      demonstrated feasibility of with virtual MP (vMP) and for MP with substance use disorders.&#xD;
      However, vMP for mothers with OUD has not been studied with respect to drug use reduction or&#xD;
      mood improvement. The investigators have also established brain mechanisms that regulate&#xD;
      parenting. Recent work from the investigators has established that a parenting intervention&#xD;
      for non-OUD mothers was associated with a larger enhancement of evoke potential responses&#xD;
      (ERPs) for emotional faces relative to neutral faces and that the magnitude of ERP responses&#xD;
      to emotional faces was associated with observed maternal sensitivity. Using functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain, the investigators have also established a&#xD;
      Maternal Behavior Neurocircuit (MBN) that regulates flexible responses to the demands of&#xD;
      their own infant - such as to the unique, ethologically salient own-baby cry and face stimuli&#xD;
      during the early postpartum period. The investigators have established fMRI maternal brain&#xD;
      changes associated with MP in non-OUD mothers, and brain effects of OUD on mothers. However,&#xD;
      it is unknown how parental brain mechanisms through which parenting interventions may work&#xD;
      for mothers with OUD, such as affecting ERP or fMRI responses to baby stimuli in the MBN.&#xD;
      Central hypotheses: Mothers with OUD who get virtual MP (vMP), compared to matched controls,&#xD;
      will show improved drug craving, mood, and stress symptoms, via changes in pre-specified MBN&#xD;
      brain regions. In the high-risk R61 phase, the investigators will establish if vMP (n=25) for&#xD;
      OUD can be implemented and improve mood, reduce drug use and affect ERP brain responses to&#xD;
      baby pictures compared with control (n=25). If hypotheses in the R61 are confirmed, the&#xD;
      investigators will confirm and expand this breakthrough with the R33 Phase (n=160, 80/group),&#xD;
      adding richer maternal outcome measures and MBN fMRI. This research will elucidate the&#xD;
      effects of parenting intervention MP on drug use and brain function for OUD mothers - with&#xD;
      translational potential for biomarker and treatment development.&#xD;
