      The purpose of the study is to test the reliability of the Picterus smartphone application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed for Filipino neonates, but implemented in other LMIC. The participants&#xD;
      include newborns with or without jaundice, Gestational age &gt;37 weeks, Age0-14days, Weight&#xD;
      &gt;2500 gram and absence of congenital malformations. Demographic data of the neonates will be&#xD;
      collected together with all the performed tests and it will be stored in a secured system.&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn and measure the bilirubin level of the neonates in a standard clinical&#xD;
      routine and will be compared to the estimated bilirubin performed with the Picterus&#xD;
      smartphone application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A descriptive cross-sectional study will be the method to understand the correlation of the&#xD;
      modalities and to determine the reliability of the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will provide an answer to whether the Picterus smartphone application is reliable to other&#xD;
      populations, especially to darker skin and with high melanin content such as Filipino&#xD;
      neonates.&#xD;
