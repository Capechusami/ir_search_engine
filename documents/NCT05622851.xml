    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, split-face, subject-blinded, comparative study to assess and compare&#xD;
      tissue aggregation and visualization of two Hyaluronic Acid fillers via ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to enroll and randomize approximately 15 subjects in a 1:1 ratio of&#xD;
      treatment to Restylane Contour or Juvederm Voluma. All subjects are to have midface volume&#xD;
      loss and contour deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects are randomized to receive treatment were injected by the Treating&#xD;
      Investigator at Baseline. The method of injection is at the discretion of the Treating&#xD;
      Investigator. A sufficient amount of product is injected to achieve optimal correction of the&#xD;
      midface, in the opinion of the Treating Investigator and subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 4-week visit, after all study procedures for the visit are completed, treated subjects&#xD;
      have the option of receiving a touch-up treatment to achieve optimal aesthetic improvement.&#xD;
      At the 6-month, 9-month, and 12-month visits, similar study procedures are performed.&#xD;

    <description>Percentage of response at 4 weeks, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months, where subjects are asked about their satisfaction with treatment outcome on the midface. Scale consists of 3 preference questions (with no difference option) and 6 satisfaction questions (with strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree).</description>
