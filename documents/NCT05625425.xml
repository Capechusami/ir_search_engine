  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic treatment is yet available for declining memory, which is an impairment affecting&#xD;
      the quality of life for many older adults and patients with cognitive impairment. Cognitive&#xD;
      training with an immersive video game promises to drive hippocampal-cortical plasticity and&#xD;
      associated gains that can restore memory capability or provide therapeutic treatment for&#xD;
      memory deficits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A hallmark of higher cognition is the capability for flexible association of diverse bits of&#xD;
      information stored in memory, such that experiences can be remembered in detailed and&#xD;
      distinct terms (i.e., high-fidelity long-term memory). Interventions capable of sustaining&#xD;
      improved learning and flexible association of new information into long-term memory (LTM)&#xD;
      have shown promising pilot results, and further development is expected to find treatments to&#xD;
      attenuate the decline of high-fidelity LTM in normal aging or provide therapeutic treatment&#xD;
      for patients with cognitive impairment without dementia (i.e., MCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project applies a translational neuroscience approach in further development of a&#xD;
      cognitive training intervention that targets sustained improvement in capabilities for&#xD;
      long-term memory (LTM) and cognitive control. Treatments use commercially available&#xD;
      head-mounted display Virtual Reality (VR) technology and tablet computers to present a deeply&#xD;
      immersive spatial wayfinding video game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on preliminary results, the hypothesis is that immersion in a game to navigate errands&#xD;
      through unfamiliar, visually complex neighborhoods (i.e., wayfinding) will be an effective&#xD;
      means to environmental enrichment, which refers to a process whereby new and complex&#xD;
      experiences bring change to brain and behavior. Research in humans shows that learning a new,&#xD;
      enriched environment spurs the healthy function of the hippocampus and supports lifelong&#xD;
      neurogenesis. Adult-borne hippocampal neurogenesis has been linked as the neurobiological&#xD;
      basis for the formation of new, high-fidelity memories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significance of this project includes functionality for remote training procedures (i.e.,&#xD;
      at home). The availability for participants to complete some of the experiment procedures at&#xD;
      home will expand enrollment opportunities and prove the practicality of the intervention&#xD;
      outside of a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Labyrinth spatial wayfinding game uses 3D and 2.5D computer graphics tools to present&#xD;
      dozens of levels of adaptive challenge and deliver a dynamic, engaging experience for&#xD;
      participants throughout the training regimen. In this project, participants will effect game&#xD;
      movement using hand controllers while playing the game in a seated position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participant, pre- and post-training assessments will occur promptly before and after&#xD;
      their 15 to 20-hour training regimen. Cognitive outcome measures will assess capabilities for&#xD;
      high-fidelity LTM retrieval and control of sustained visual attention, and some measures will&#xD;
      include collection of associated functional MRI (fMRI) and structural MRI data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness of the wayfinding game intervention will be evidenced by post-training&#xD;
      improvements in retrieval of high-fidelity LTM and cognitive control capabilities. FMRI&#xD;
      results associated with the measured cognitive improvements will localize changes in&#xD;
      functional brain networks that support gains in memory capabilities. Structural MRI measures&#xD;
      will assess morphometric and volumetric changes from pre- to post-training assessments.&#xD;
