      The aim of this study is to develop and validate a tool that estimates the degree of&#xD;
      pregnancy-associated progression of renal disease in women with CKD and pregnancy outcomes in&#xD;
      an international multicentre cohort study. Two prediction models will be developed to&#xD;
      estimate the likelihood of both outcomes. The models will be developed and internally&#xD;
      validated in one cohort in the United Kingdom and then externally validated using four&#xD;
      international datasets.&#xD;
