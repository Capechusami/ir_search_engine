    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, ambispective observational cohort study. The patients with corona&#xD;
      virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be included in the study. The patients will be divided&#xD;
      into 4 groups according to the treatment mode (Azvudine treatment group within 48 hours after&#xD;
      the first positive for nucleic acid, Azvudine treatment group after 48 hours after the first&#xD;
      positive for nucleic acid, short course of Azvudine treatment without nucleic acid turning&#xD;
      negative, and the control group) . This study aims to analyze the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Azvudine in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
