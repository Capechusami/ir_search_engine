    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a severe type of snoring causing people to choke in their&#xD;
      sleep. It affects millions of Americans, causing many health problems. For example, patients&#xD;
      with OSA often feel very sleepy and are at risk of falling asleep while driving. OSA also&#xD;
      causes elevated blood pressure increasing the risk for heart attacks and strokes. Patients&#xD;
      with OSA are often treated with a face-mask that helps them breath at night but can be&#xD;
      difficult to tolerate. In fact, about half the patients eventually stop using this mask.&#xD;
      Because there are few other treatments (and no drug therapy), many OSA patients are still&#xD;
      untreated. Of note, especially young adults (i.e. 18 to 50 years old) benefit from treating&#xD;
      their OSA, but they are also less likely to use the mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acetazolamide (a mild diuretic drug) has been used for over 50 years to treat many different&#xD;
      conditions and is well tolerated. Recent data suggest, that acetazolamide may help OSA&#xD;
      patients to not choke in their sleep and lower their blood pressure. Especially young adults&#xD;
      with OSA are likely to respond well to this drug. Further, its low cost (66Â¢/day) and once-&#xD;
      daily dosing may be particularly attractive for young OSA patients unable or unwilling to&#xD;
      wear a mask each night. But previous studies had many limitations and did not focus on young&#xD;
      adults. The goal of this study is to test if acetazolamide can improve sleep apnea and&#xD;
      cardiovascular health in young adults with OSA (18-50 years old), and how it does that. Thus,&#xD;
      we will treat 46 young OSA patients with acetazolamide or placebo for 2 weeks each. The order&#xD;
      in which participants receive the drug or placebo will be randomized. At the end of each 2&#xD;
      week period we will assess OSA severity and cardiovascular health. Thus, this study will help&#xD;
      assess acetazolamide's potential value for OSA treatment, and may also help to identify&#xD;
      patients who are most likely to respond to acetazolamide (including select individuals &gt;50&#xD;
      years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, this work promises a drug therapy option for millions of OSA patients who are&#xD;
      unable to tolerate current treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial is to compare the&#xD;
      medication acetazolamide 500mg/day against placebo in young adults (i.e. 18 to 50 years old)&#xD;
      who have obstructive sleep apnea and a high blood pressure. The main questions this trial&#xD;
      aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is acetazolamide for 2 weeks more effective than placebo for treating obstructive sleep&#xD;
           apnea?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is acetazolamide for 2 weeks more effective than placebo for improving cardiovascular&#xD;
           health including blood pressure?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are potential predictors and mechanisms of improvements with acetazolamide in sleep&#xD;
           apnea and cardiovascular health?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligibility screening (online or via phone; ~10min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who screen positive: in-person eligibility assessment (~1h) including a&#xD;
           history, exam, blood testing, plus an overnight home sleep test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who are eligible: will come to the research lab (~15min) and be provided&#xD;
           with a 2-week supply of the first study drug (i.e. acetazolamide or placebo) to be taken&#xD;
           each night at home. Neither the researchers, nor the participants will know whether&#xD;
           participants received acetazolamide or placebo. During this 2-week period, participants&#xD;
           will wear a watch-sized activity tracker to measure their sleep amount and researchers&#xD;
           will check in on participants weekly; at the end of the 2-week period participants are&#xD;
           asked to wear a 24-hour blood pressure monitor and then come in for an overnight visit&#xD;
           (~12h) which includes the following activities: general exam, questionnaires, blood&#xD;
           test, measures of cardiovascular health (e.g. blood pressure) and neurocognitive&#xD;
           function (e.g. a memory test), and an overnight sleep study to assess the severity of&#xD;
           sleep apnea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will then receive a 2-week supply of the other study drug (i.e.&#xD;
           acetazolamide or placebo) and repeat all the activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional: after completing the activities above, participants who are interested in&#xD;
           using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and are deemed good candidates for this&#xD;
           approach by the investigators, will be offered 2-weeks of CPAP and repeat the same&#xD;
           activities as were done when taking the study drugs (except there will be no overnight&#xD;
           sleep study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will compare the effects of acetazolamide on sleep apnea severity and&#xD;
      cardiovascular health with the effects of placebo (and CPAP) to see if acetazolamide may be&#xD;
      an effective treatment for select patients with sleep apnea.&#xD;
