  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, single-center, open-label study that enrolls adult subjects with extensive&#xD;
      stage lung cancer or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer that is platinum-refractory and&#xD;
      received PD-1 and/or PD-L1 therapy. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of using&#xD;
      a new treatment called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells against the&#xD;
      GD2 antigen (iC9-GD2.CAR.IL-15 T cells) in subjects with lung cancer. How much (dose) of the&#xD;
      iC9-GD2.CAR.IL-15 T cells are safe to use without causing too many side effects and what is&#xD;
      the maximum dose that could be tolerated will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified immune cells as an experimental treatment that combines antibodies and T cells will&#xD;
      be used. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from foreign invaders like bacteria. T&#xD;
      cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill&#xD;
      viruses and other cells, including tumor cells. Although antibodies and T cells have been&#xD;
      used to treat cancer and they both have shown promise, neither alone has been able to cure&#xD;
      most patients. This study will combine T cells and antibodies to create a more effective&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment that is being researched in this study is called autologous T lymphocyte&#xD;
      chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the disialoganglioside (GD2) antigen that&#xD;
      expresses Interleukin (IL)-15, and the inducible caspase 9 safety switch (iC9). The short&#xD;
      name for this treatment is iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T cells therapy is an experimental therapy and&#xD;
      has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. There are two steps. In the first&#xD;
      step, blood will be collected from the subjects to prepare the iC9-GD2.CAR.IL-15 T cells. T&#xD;
      cells will be isolated from the blood and modified to make iC9-GD2.CAR.IL-15. In the second&#xD;
      step, the iC9-GD2.CAR.IL-15 T cells produced from the subject's own blood will be&#xD;
      administered to the subject.&#xD;

    <description>The number of participants with adverse events (AE)s will be reported as a measure of the safety and tolerability of C9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T. AEs will be classified and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0.&#xD;
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL. Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death related to AE.</description>
