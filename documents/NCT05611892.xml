  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being performed to see if 18F-FDS is a useful imaging agent for diagnosis of&#xD;
      bacterial infections. Position Emission Tomography / computed tomography (CT) scans will be&#xD;
      obtained after intravenous injection of 18F-FDS to determine biodistribution and&#xD;
      pathophysiology in diseased subjects.&#xD;
