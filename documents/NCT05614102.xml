  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced solid tumors are types of cancer that may have spread to nearby tissue, lymph nodes,&#xD;
      and/or to distant parts of the body and that are unlikely to be cured or controlled with&#xD;
      currently available treatments. This study focuses on certain types of skin cancer, kidney&#xD;
      cancer, stomach cancer, and lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatment BAY2965501 is currently under development for the treatment of people&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BAY2965501 blocks an enzyme in T-cells to activate them. T-cells are a type of immune cell&#xD;
      that are known to have an anti-cancer effect and BAY2965501 is a potential new immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this first-in-human study is to learn:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how safe different doses of BAY2965501 are,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the degree to which medical problems caused by BAY2965501 can be tolerated (also called&#xD;
           tolerability),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  what maximum amount can be given, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how it moves into, through and out of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer this, the researchers will look at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the number and severity of medical problems participants have after taking BAY2965501&#xD;
           for each dose level. These medical problems are also referred to as adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the (average) total level of BAY2965501 in the blood (also called AUC) after intake of&#xD;
           single and multiple doses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the (average) highest level of BAY2965501 in the blood (also called Cmax) after intake&#xD;
           of single and multiple doses Doctors keep track of all medical problems that&#xD;
           participants have during the study, even if they do not think the medical problem might&#xD;
           be related to the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the researchers want to know if and how the participants' tumors change after&#xD;
      taking BAY2965501.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have two parts. The first part, called dose escalation, is done to find the&#xD;
      most appropriate dose that can be given in the second part. For this, each participant will&#xD;
      receive one of the increasing doses of BAY2965501. They will take BAY2965501 daily by mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in the second part, called dose expansion, will receive the most appropriate&#xD;
      dose from the first part daily as tablet by mouth. Participants in both parts of the study,&#xD;
      will take the study treatment until the tumor gets worse (also known as 'disease&#xD;
      progression'), the participants have medical problems, until they leave the study, or until&#xD;
      the study is terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be in the study for several months, including a screening phase of up&#xD;
      to 28 days, few months of treatment depending on the participant's benefit, and a follow up&#xD;
      phase after the end of treatment. The following approximate numbers of visits to the study&#xD;
      site are planned: two during the screening phase, six in the first treatment month, one to&#xD;
      three per month in the following periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in part 2 will be assigned to one of four groups depending on cancer&#xD;
      characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures described below may vary between these groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the study team will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  take blood and urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  do physical examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  check vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  examine heart health using ECG (electrocardiogram)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  check if the participants' cancer has grown and/or spread using CT (computed tomography)&#xD;
           or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and, if needed, bone scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  take tumor samples (if required)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment period ends with a visit no later than 7 days after the last BAY2965501 dose.&#xD;
      About 30 and 90 days after the last dose and every 12 weeks thereafter, the study team will&#xD;
      check the participants' health and any changes in cancer. This follow-up period ends with&#xD;
      worsening of the cancer, start of new anti-cancer therapy, or until the participant leaves&#xD;
      the study. In addition, the study doctors and their team will contact the participant every&#xD;
      12 weeks to learn about the participant's survival. This ends no later than 12 months after&#xD;
      the last participant started treatment or by the end of the study, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study participant benefits from treatment, continuation of treatment with BAY2965501&#xD;
      beyond the duration of this study might be possible.&#xD;

             of leptomeningeal involvement).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with gastrointestinal conditions that may compromise oral absorption such&#xD;
             as short bowel syndrome or active tumor-related bowel obstruction with ongoing&#xD;
             symptoms compromising absorption over last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form&#xD;
             of systemic treatment and is allowed. Steroid inhalers are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis / interstitial lung disease that&#xD;
             required steroids or has current pneumonitis / interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A marked prolongation of QT/QTc interval at screening (e.g., repeated demonstration of&#xD;
             a QTc interval &gt;470 ms).&#xD;
