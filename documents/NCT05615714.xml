      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral Nerve Field Stimulation (PNFS) has been utilized for the treatment of facial pain&#xD;
      for around 60 years, and the commercial devices needed to deliver PNFS have been available&#xD;
      for around 30 years. The safety and efficacy of the procedure has been demonstrated by&#xD;
      various uncontrolled observational studies. It serves as a part of daily neurosurgical&#xD;
      practice for selected patients in UHN Toronto Western Hospital. This therapeutic modality&#xD;
      involves subcutaneous implantation of electrodes in the vicinity of trigeminal nerve branches&#xD;
      and application of electrical current using a permanently implanted pulse generator (IPG).&#xD;
      Similar to other forms of neuromodulation, PNFS is non-ablative, reversible, adjustable and&#xD;
      associated with a relatively low risk of severe complications. A meta-analysis of&#xD;
      paresthesia-inducing (PI) PFNS studies in the literature revealed a treatment efficacy of 75%&#xD;
      decrease in VAS scores (mean difference: -6.32 out of 10) with PNFS utilization for facial&#xD;
      pain. (PMID: 35180702)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who underwent a successful unilateral PNFS implantation surgery (trial and permanent&#xD;
      implantation) for a facial pain syndrome as a standard of care treatment, will be screened&#xD;
      for inclusion after permanent implantable pulse generator (IPG) implantation. Upon consent,&#xD;
      the investigators will set up participants' IPG to deliver stimulation with parameters tested&#xD;
      during the trial period (paresthesia-inducing parameters) for 2 weeks. The participants will&#xD;
      come back to hospital at postoperative week 2 and will be randomized (1:1 ratio) between the&#xD;
      two arms of the study (Group 1= sham, Group 2= paresthesia-free (PF) stimulation). Each&#xD;
      participant will consecutively experience all two stimulation groups by 2-week periods in a&#xD;
      crossover design. Both participants and clinical investigators that will assess the pain will&#xD;
      be blind during the study period (between postoperative week 2 and 6). After 6 weeks, the&#xD;
      treatment arms will be merged and all the participants will receive any stimulation parameter&#xD;
      that they feel more benefit from (&quot;best&quot; parameter). Outcomes will be assessed 6 and 12&#xD;
      months post-operatively.&#xD;
