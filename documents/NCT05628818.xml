  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the possible effects of tDCS (Transcranial Direct Current&#xD;
      Stimulation) treatment to the left DLPFC on executive functions in patients with an acute&#xD;
      stroke affecting the frontal lobe or the basal ganglia. The study will include 40 acute&#xD;
      stroke subjects. Participants will undergo a global cognitive assessment with the MoCA test&#xD;
      and a specific assessment of executive functions with the abbreviated Wisconsin test, the&#xD;
      five digit test and the digit span evaluation (a subtest from the Wechsler intelligence scale&#xD;
      for adults-IV). Participants will then undergo real or sham stimulation with anodal tDCS&#xD;
      combined with cognitive training of the main executive functions: working memory, inhibitory&#xD;
      control and cognitive flexibility. After a 10-session intervention, a the baseline cognitive&#xD;
      assessment will be repeated and subsequently, a follow-up of up to 12 months will be carried&#xD;
      out.&#xD;

    <measure>Five digit test</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation immediately post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Assessing inhibitory control. A numerical task divided into four components. The first component (reading) demands subjects to name numbers from 1 to 5 as fast as they can. On the second component (counting), they need to describe quantities from 1 to 5. The third component (choosing) involves a selective attention trial, where the subjects must not read the numbers, but rather tell how many numbers are present in each stimulus, in an incongruent condition. The last component (shifting) is similar to the choosing trial, but for each of the five stimuli, there is one previously where the subject must read the stimulus numbers. The test total scores will be used as the main measure in this study. Higher scores indicate worse performance.</description>
