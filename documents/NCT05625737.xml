  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-arm, prospective study to investigate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      fruquintinib combined with sintilimab in the second-line treatment of Chinese patients with&#xD;
      advanced gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastro-esophageal junction or the stomach who have&#xD;
      documented progression after being treated with a 1st line chemotherapy can be included. All&#xD;
      patients will receive a second line therapy with fruquintinib and sintilimab, a checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitor. Clinical and radiographic assessment will be performed regularly. Patients will be&#xD;
      treated until disease progression, untolerable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
