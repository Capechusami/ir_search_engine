  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine and amphetamine has various cardiovascular and central nervous system&#xD;
      effects. Initially prescribed in the 1930s for respiratory ailments such as asthma, current&#xD;
      clinical indications of amphetamine range from treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity&#xD;
      disorder to narcolepsy. The mechanism of action is primarily potentiation of release of&#xD;
      monoamine neurotransmitters, mainly dopamine and norepinephrine, from presynaptic nerve&#xD;
      endings into the synaptic space, in addition to attenuation of monoamine metabolism by&#xD;
      inhibiting monoamine oxidase. This in turn leads to an increase in sympathetic tone by alpha&#xD;
      and beta adrenergic receptor activation, resulting in elevations in heart rate, respiratory&#xD;
      rate, and vascular tone. Long-term use is associated with many adverse health effects&#xD;
      including cardiomyopathy, hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. Other long-term associations&#xD;
      include increased violent behavior, documented increased motor vehicle accidents, and&#xD;
      clandestine manufacturing of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methamphetamine has also been associated with deleterious effects on society as a whole; it&#xD;
      is credited as a cause of increase in rates of crime, abuse, and unemployment, and associated&#xD;
      with great economic burden. A significant portion of healthcare resources consumed are rooted&#xD;
      in the emergency department, particularly in trauma. Studies previously performed have&#xD;
      demonstrated that methamphetamine use among patients that present to trauma centers has been&#xD;
      continually increasing. Death is usually caused by cardiovascular collapse and while&#xD;
      amphetamine abuse has been considered as a potential cause of acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome, the reports are usually anecdotal. This investigation considers reviewing&#xD;
      individuals with few to zero medical conditions who develop acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome and are methamphetamine positive&#xD;

        The study was completed at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center County Burn Center in Colton,&#xD;
        California, which operates as the only burn center for San Bernardino, Inyo, Mono and&#xD;
        Riverside Counties. ARMC covers one of the largest geographical areas in the United States.&#xD;
        Due to the high prevalence of methamphetamine use, this location sees a high incidence of&#xD;
        burn patients who either use amphetamine or are the result of methamphetamine lab&#xD;
        explosions.&#xD;
