  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the current emerging epidemic of the MonkeyPox Virus (MPXV) and its route of&#xD;
      transmission, the main objective of this pilot study is to characterize the presence of the&#xD;
      MPXV in the semen of patients in the acute phase of infection and following this infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since May 2022, a total of 16 000 new cases of Monkey Pox Virus infection has been reported&#xD;
      in 76 non-endemic countries. The WHO has declared this epidemic as a public health emergency.&#xD;
      Principal routes of transmission are direct skin or mucosa contact or aerosol transmission.&#xD;
      The current epidemic mainly affects men having sexual relations with others men and men&#xD;
      reporting having recent sexual relations with new or multiple partners. We may wonder if&#xD;
      there is a risk of transmission during an intercourse. Moreover, Monkey pox virus infection&#xD;
      in human testicle has not been studied yet. Among viruses that infect human semen, some&#xD;
      viruses can persist for several months or even years in the semen of cured men. In this&#xD;
      context, we propose a research project about the pathophysiology of MPXV in the male genital&#xD;
      tract by a clinical approach. Men with a diagnosis of MPXV infection confirmed by a positive&#xD;
      PCR and who agreed to be included as volunteer will go to CECOS at Paule de Viguier Hospital,&#xD;
      Purpan. Each patient will take a semen and urine sample, have a blood sample and a saliva&#xD;
      sample, and a skin sample in case of a lesion; the earliest after the confirmation of the&#xD;
      diagnosis of the infection (before the 7th day, the days will be noted) then on Day 15, Day&#xD;
      30, Day 60, Day 90 and Day 180.&#xD;
