  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is common MSK disease with prevalence of 60 to 70 percent. Patients with low&#xD;
      back discomfort are typically treated conservatively by physical therapists. Progressive&#xD;
      muscles relaxation technique has been shown in several studies to reduce chronic back pain&#xD;
      and increase flexibility. pressure biofeedback therapy works on Intra abdominal pressure.it&#xD;
      helps to alleviate compression on lumbar spine and support the adjacent lumbar spine.The aim&#xD;
      of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the effectiveness of pressure biofeedback&#xD;
      training (Pr.BFB) in combination with progressive muscles relaxation technique (PMR) &amp;&#xD;
      progressive muscles relaxation training alone on pain, disability, ROM &amp; endurance of muscles&#xD;
      among nonspecific chronic low back pain patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial will be carried out in the Physical Therapy O.P.D of Dow hospital&#xD;
      Karachi. Collection of data will commence right after approval of synopsis from Dow IRB. A&#xD;
      sample of 70 NSCLBP patients calculated by using mean &amp; SD of visual analogue scale in&#xD;
      abdominal stabilisation training with Pr.BFB stabilizer was 2.69 ±0.93 and Progressive&#xD;
      muscular Relaxation VAS was 3.863 ±2.03. Before being recruited into the experiment, patients&#xD;
      will be screened to ensure that they meet the inclusion criteria. Pain rating scale and&#xD;
      Roland-Morris questionnaire will be used to gather data after explaining the research goals&#xD;
      to patients and obtaining formal consent from them. Patients will be divided into 2&#xD;
      interventional groups by simple random sampling, with 35 patients in each group. Experimental&#xD;
      group will be received Pressure Bio-Feedback Therapy in combination with PMR Technique and&#xD;
      Thermotherapy. The Control group, on the other hand, will be received a combination of&#xD;
      Progressive Muscle Relaxation Technique and Thermotherapy for non-specific CLBP. It will be a&#xD;
      6-weeks intervention plan with 3 sessions per week (40-minutes each). Assessor will be&#xD;
      blinded to the treatment. Roland Morris Low back pain and disability questionnaire (RMQ) and&#xD;
      the NPR Scale will be used as primary outcome measures. Secondary outcomes will be determined&#xD;
      by modified-modified Schober test for assessing lumbar ROM &amp; Pressure Biofeedback Stabilizer&#xD;
      unit helps to gauge muscular endurance.&#xD;
