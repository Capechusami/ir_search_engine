    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter Phase 1b study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and preliminary&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity of NT-I7 administration following standard of care CD19 CAR T-cell&#xD;
      therapy for eligible subjects with r/r LBCL. The study consists of a Dose Escalation phase&#xD;
      followed by a Dose Expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Dose Escalation phase, subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 7 dose levels, starting with&#xD;
      60 µg/kg and up to 720 µg/kg. A dose schedule for an individual dose level will not be taken&#xD;
      into expansion until the Dose Escalation phase has been completed or a maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) has been determined, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Dose Expansion phase, up to 15 subjects will be enrolled and treated with the&#xD;
      recommended dose identified in the Dose Escalation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 17- 42 subjects in the Dose Escalation phase, and up to 15 subjects in the Dose&#xD;
      Expansion phase will be enrolled at approximately 6 study centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NT-I7 (aka rhIL-7-hyFc, efineptakin alpha), Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah®), Axicabtagene&#xD;
      ciloleucel (Yescarta®), Lisocabtagene Maraleucel (Breyanzi®)&#xD;
&#xD;
      *CAR-T Therapy will be administered per manufacturer's recommendations and in accordance with&#xD;
      FDA prescribing guidelines and best institutional practices for standard of care use.&#xD;
