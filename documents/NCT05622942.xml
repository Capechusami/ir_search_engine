  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae infections often cause serious health problems, especially in&#xD;
      infants and the elderly. Failure to cover all polysaccharide types of vaccines is a greater&#xD;
      problem for adults than for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to preliminarily evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a&#xD;
      recombinant pneumococcal protein vaccine applied to adults aged 50 years and older to provide&#xD;
      a basis for subsequent clinical trial design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection varies widely with age, underlying disease,&#xD;
      and living environment. Worldwide, infants and the elderly are at high risk for pneumococcal&#xD;
      disease. Disease from pneumococcal infections can affect multiple organ systems and lead to&#xD;
      multiple disease syndromes. This vaccine has a higher coverage rate, capable of reaching more&#xD;
      than 94%. With the high coverage rate, it can effectively prevent the occurrence of serotype&#xD;
      substitution and the outbreak of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal-associated diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is a Phase Ib clinical trial in adults aged 50 years and older based on&#xD;
      the Phase Ia clinical trial.&#xD;
