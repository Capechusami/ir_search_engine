  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Logotherapy can help people find their meaning in life and help people reduce their suicidal&#xD;
      ideation. Suicide was the second leading cause of death for 15-24 year-olds. Logotherapy can&#xD;
      increase exploration of meaning in life for adolescents and prevent them from attempting&#xD;
      suicide. However, most research only explored the effects of logotherapy on meaning in life&#xD;
      and depression in adolescents with mood disorders. There is a lack of research to explore the&#xD;
      effects of logotherapy on anxiety and suicidal ideation in adolescents. Therefore, this study&#xD;
      will explore the effects of logotherapy on meaning in life, depression, anxiety and suicidal&#xD;
      ideation in adolescents with mood disorders. This study will carry on for two years and the&#xD;
      sample will be recruited from the adolescents' outpatient clinic of psychiatric department in&#xD;
      hospitals. The first and second year of the study will use a single-blind randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial approach, the aim is to evaluate the short-term and longitudinal effects of&#xD;
      logotherapy meaning in life, depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation in adolescents with&#xD;
      mood disorders, the sample will collect 120 adolescents with mood disorders, and will use&#xD;
      four instruments for testing the logotherapy intervention. The four instruments are: (1)&#xD;
      Purpose in life Test, (2) Beck Depression Inventory II, (3) Beck Anxiety Inventory, (4) Beck&#xD;
      Scale for Suicide Ideation. Data will be analyzed using the Statistic Package for the Social&#xD;
      Science. The result of this study will be applied to the mental health team in the clinical&#xD;
      psychiatric department for taking care of patients, and help adolescents with mood disorders&#xD;
      to find their meaning in life, further, to reduce their depression, anxiety and suicidal&#xD;
      ideation.&#xD;

      Scale for Suicide Ideation. Data will be analyzed using the Statistic Package for the Social&#xD;
      Science.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research process includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participant acceptance and signing consent: Referral by doctors from Chang Gung&#xD;
           Hospitals and National Taiwan University Hospitals. Full-time research assistants will&#xD;
           explain the purpose of the research, the research process, the confidentiality of data&#xD;
           processing, and allow the individual to freely decide whether to participate without&#xD;
           being forced, obtaining a signed consent form. Those who are under twenty-years-old will&#xD;
           also obtain the consent of the legal representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pre-test: data collectors blinded single-blind study, the work-students who did not&#xD;
           participate in the intervention measures will collect the patient's basic data sheet and&#xD;
           four scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Random assignment: The psychologist (co-host) randomly assigns the cases to the&#xD;
           experimental group or the control group, and assigns the groups by means of a&#xD;
           computer-generated random assignment table.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Intervention: The experimental group received 6 interventions of logotherapy given by a&#xD;
           full-time assistant, while the control group received routine outpatient treatment of&#xD;
           general adolescent psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Posttest: Both the experimental group and the control group will collect the same four&#xD;
           scales three times by the work-study students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of this study will be applied to the mental health team in the clinical&#xD;
      psychiatric department for taking care of patients, and help adolescents with mood disorders&#xD;
      to find their meaning in life, further, to reduce their depression, anxiety and suicidal&#xD;
      ideation.&#xD;
