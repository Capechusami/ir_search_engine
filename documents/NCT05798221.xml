  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection may subsequently be affected by the so-called&#xD;
      post-COVID syndrome. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of a&#xD;
      multimodal 10-week group program consisting of self-help strategies based on complementary&#xD;
      medicine approaches of TEM (Traditional European Medicine), TCM (Traditional Chinese&#xD;
      Medicine), and TIM (Traditional Indian Medicine) in addition to treatment as usual versus&#xD;
      treatment as usual alone (no active study intervention/waiting list). Endpoints of the study&#xD;
      include subjective quantitative and qualitative as well as objective (physician-reported)&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
