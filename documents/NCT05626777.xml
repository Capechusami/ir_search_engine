  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common pathology, with a prevalence of 6 to 8% and more than 4 million patients&#xD;
      in France. Its management is based on different therapeutic axes. Their use is very dependent&#xD;
      on disease control, with therapeutic escalation, from treatment on demand to a combination of&#xD;
      them at high dosage, according to the severe asthma's phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these effective therapeutic tools, there is a lack of control of the disease in the&#xD;
      vast majority of cases, affecting at least 60% of asthmatics. Among the factors associated&#xD;
      with lack of control, non-compliance with inhaled therapies is frequent and requires to be&#xD;
      systematically assessed in the absence of control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Its evaluation by definition is complex and variously appreciated, fluctuating from 40 to&#xD;
      80%. The means proposed for evaluating it involve doctor/patient interviews, evaluation of&#xD;
      the therapeutic response, questionnaires, evaluation of drug consumption (evaluation of&#xD;
      number of empty boxes, integrated electronic device, withdrawal of drugs from pharmacies,&#xD;
      etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma control is commonly evaluated using the validated Asthma Control Test score, in&#xD;
      clinical practice and/or in research fields. An ACT score greater than 20 indicates&#xD;
      well-controlled asthma. In addition, a change of at least 3 points is likely to indicate a&#xD;
      clinically meaningful change in asthma control (Minimally Clinical Important Difference) in&#xD;
      an individual patient over time and a change of 4 points or more further reduces the risk&#xD;
      that the change is due to measurement error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of severe eosinophilic asthma, Mepolizumab has shown its benefit in&#xD;
      controlling asthma, reducing the number of exacerbations and its ability to decrease the use&#xD;
      of oral corticosteroids (MENSA, SIRIUS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mepolizumab is now available in 2 new &quot;ready-to-use&quot; forms: a pre-filled syringe and an&#xD;
      auto-injector pen. Both systems can be administered at home either by a nurse or by the&#xD;
      patient himself (self-administration). The choice is left to the discretion of the&#xD;
      prescribing pulmonologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These new possibilities of Mepolizumab administration offer greater freedom to the patient,&#xD;
      possibly allowing him to empower himself by carrying out his own treatment, without&#xD;
      constraint and without being dependent on the availability of a nurse or another healthcare&#xD;
      professional qualified to inject Mepolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These new methods of Mepolizumab self- administration also open the field to therapeutic&#xD;
      non-compliance, a new problem in the field of biotherapies used for the treatment of severe&#xD;
      asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator hypothesize a potential therapeutic non-compliance associated with the new&#xD;
      method of administration of Mepolizumab, with self-injection by the patient, without the&#xD;
      assistance of a nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess this problem, the investigator propose to compare in a therapeutic trial&#xD;
      Mepolizumab administered by pre-filled syringe by a home nurse every month versus Mepolizumab&#xD;
      self-administered by auto-injector pen by the patient every month.&#xD;
