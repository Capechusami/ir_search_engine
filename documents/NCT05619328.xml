      This prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group&#xD;
      Phase III clinical study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of the Test&#xD;
      product versus placebo in male and non-pregnant female subjects with clinically diagnosed&#xD;
      peripheral sensory polyneuropathy of different etiologies aged 18 to 70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in 17 sites in Mexico. 318 patients with clinically diagnosed&#xD;
      symptoms of peripheral sensory polyneuropathy of different etiologies who fulfill the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive&#xD;
      either oral vitamin B combination daily or matching placebo for 120 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary and secondary outcome measures will be evaluated at each post-Screening visit.&#xD;
      Exploratory outcomes, and safety/tolerability/treatment satisfaction assessments will be&#xD;
      evaluated as per schedule of activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approvals were obtained from Local Ethics Committees and from Mexican Regulatory Authority&#xD;
      (COFEPRIS).&#xD;
