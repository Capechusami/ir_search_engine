  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Chinese version of the Respiratory Distress Observation Scale，C-RDOS</measure>
    <time_frame>The score change up to three days.</time_frame>
    <description>RDOS is an eight-item ordinal scale designed to measure the presence and intensity of respiratory distress in adults. High score means high respiratory distress.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>The score change up to three days.</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is the depression module, which scores each of the nine DSM-IV criteria as &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day). It has been validated for use in primary care.[2]&#xD;
It is not a screening tool for depression but it is used to monitor the severity of depression and response to treatment. high score mean higher emotion distress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Chinese version of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System，C-ESAS</measure>
    <time_frame>The score change up to three days.</time_frame>
    <description>The ESAS includes 11 symptoms: pain, tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, sleep, well-being, shortness of breath, and other. It uses a 0-10 numerical scale: 0 shows the absence of a symptom, and 10 shows the worst experience of the symptom.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Smart bracelet_Heart rate variability (HRV)</measure>
    <time_frame>Continue wear bracelet five days to record HRV data.</time_frame>
    <description>HRV is the physiological phenomenon of the variation in the time interval between consecutive heartbeats in milliseconds. A normal, healthy heart does not tick evenly like a metronome, but instead, when looking at the milliseconds between heartbeats, there is constant variation.</description>
