  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cementless ATTUNETM Rotating Platform Knee system was compared in a single-blind,&#xD;
      randomized RSA trial to its predecessor, the LCS rotating platform Knee System. In this&#xD;
      previous study, 61 knees were subjected to RSA examinations at 1-day and 3, 6, 12 and 24&#xD;
      months postoperative. This study found a promising equal migration of both tibial components&#xD;
      and a lesser migration of the femoral component of the ATTUNETM knee system after two years,&#xD;
      although with a similar migration rate between year 1 and 2. this raises the question of&#xD;
      whether the migration of the prostheses relative to each other will increase or remain the&#xD;
      same in the long term. To examine this, a mid-and long-term RSA follow-up to measure&#xD;
      migration is necessary. In addition, another new RSA measurement parameter has become known&#xD;
      in recent years that may provide an indication of the bonding of the prosthesis to the bone&#xD;
      at the time of measurement. This new parameter, called the Induced Displacement (ID) of a&#xD;
      prosthesis, measures the position and orientation relative to the bone while the prosthesis&#xD;
      is under different loading conditions (e.g., patient in supine or standing position). This&#xD;
      means that a large measured difference between these different loading condition measurements&#xD;
      would indicate that osseointegration of the prosthesis never occurred or is no longer&#xD;
      present. To improve the understanding of the tendency of both prostheses to aseptic loosening&#xD;
      after a mid- to long-term follow up, migration over time and inducible displacement analyses&#xD;
      are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to accurately compare mid- and long-term migration of&#xD;
      two uncemented TKR prostheses. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate if&#xD;
      inducible displacement can be used as a parameter to detect loose implants, and to compare&#xD;
      inducible displacement, clinical and radiological outcome and patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
      (PROMS) after a follow-up of 5 and 10 years of two uncemented TKR prostheses.&#xD;
