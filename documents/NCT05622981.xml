  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is a critical public health issue. Obesity in childhood is associated with&#xD;
      many complications, including high blood pressure, type II diabetes mellitus, abnormal blood&#xD;
      lipid values, obstructive sleep apnea, development of fatty liver, anxiety and depression.&#xD;
      Addressing pediatric obesity is important not only to avoid these comorbidities in childhood,&#xD;
      but also to mitigate long-term negative health outcomes, as overweight and obese youth are&#xD;
      likely to remain overweight or obese into adulthood. There are published guidelines, however,&#xD;
      there is not a successful standardized approach to the management of this problem. The most&#xD;
      studied approach to pediatric obesity is multidisciplinary, high-resource weight management&#xD;
      programs that are unable to be conducted in the primary care setting, and the prevalence of&#xD;
      pediatric obesity continues to increase. The purpose of this study is to create, implement&#xD;
      and evaluate a standardized protocol for the management of pediatric obesity in a&#xD;
      low-resource primary care setting, using age-specific educational materials and every 2-week&#xD;
      follow-up visits focused on achieving progress toward healthy lifestyle goals. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be the change in subject body mass index (BMI) percentile over 24 weeks of&#xD;
      visits to the primary care doctor at a pediatric clinic.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All patients who present to the Beaumont Pediatric Outpatient Clinic for a Health Maintenance&#xD;
      or Acute Care visit that meet inclusion criteria will be eligible for enrollment in the&#xD;
      study. Eligible patients and their caregivers/guardians will be approached during health&#xD;
      maintenance or acute care visits in the Beaumont Pediatric Outpatient Clinic by their&#xD;
      treating physician. The caregivers/guardians will be giving permission for their child's&#xD;
      participation in the study. However, we will also obtain oral assent from patients age 8-13&#xD;
      and written assent from patients age 14-17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon enrollment, blood tests will be ordered including a lipid panel, which measures&#xD;
      different fats in the blood, including total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL, the&#xD;
      &quot;good&quot; cholesterol), low-density lipoprotein (LDL, the &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol), and smaller fats&#xD;
      called triglycerides; alanine transaminase (ALT, a measure of liver function); and glycated&#xD;
      hemoglobin-adult-1c (Hb A1c, a measure of sugar levels in the blood over the last three&#xD;
      months. Each enrolled patient will receive an age-specific binder containing educational&#xD;
      handouts. There are 11 educational handouts that have been created, edited and reviewed by&#xD;
      the study team, and deemed readable at the first-grade level). Binders will be specific to&#xD;
      four different age groups: age 2-4, age 5-8, age 9-11, and age 12+ to ensure the information&#xD;
      within the binder is appropriate for the age of the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, starting at the enrollment visit, the patients and their family members will&#xD;
      identify a specific goal toward implementing healthy lifestyle changes and will be encouraged&#xD;
      to keep track of whether this goal has been achieved using the goal sheets within the binder.&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will occur every 2 weeks for 6 months for a total of 12 visits, and a new&#xD;
      handout will be given for the binder each time. Blood test values will be repeated as&#xD;
      recommended by the 2023 American Academy of Pediatrics Guideline for the Evaluation and&#xD;
      Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Obesity to evaluate for comorbidities. There will&#xD;
      be follow-up surveys given to parents and children over the age of 12 to identify areas of&#xD;
      improvement and barriers to healthy choices. For children 2-11 the parents will be provided&#xD;
      the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is classified as a single-arm interventional study because all patients are&#xD;
      assigned to behavioral intervention per the study protocol, and there is no comparator group.&#xD;
      Participant data will be reported based on age ranges specified in the protocol.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline body mass index (BMI) percentile at 24 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BMI will be calculated from height and weight using the formula BMI=(weight in kilograms)/(height in meters)squared, and BMI-for-age percentile determined based on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) standardized growth charts. BMI percentile at study enrollment (baseline) will be subtracted from BMI percentile measured at the 24-week visit to calculate change in BMI percentile. Negative numbers will indicate a decrease in BMI percentile over time, while positive numbers will indicate an increase in BMI percentile over the study period.</description>
