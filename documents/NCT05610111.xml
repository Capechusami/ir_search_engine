  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to test a Web-based Information Tool (WIT) software providing&#xD;
      additional information regarding time in range, GMI, hypo- and hyperglycemia risks,&#xD;
      variability tracker, daily glycemic profiles, and potential changes of insulin pump&#xD;
      parameters, to users of a commercially available Closed-Loop Control (CLC) System (Control-IQ&#xD;
      Technology).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized two-arm crossover group trial in which both groups will use the CLC&#xD;
      (Control-IQ) plus WIT. The difference between the two groups will be the order of the&#xD;
      interventions. Each group will undergo screening and collection of baseline data from their&#xD;
      personal AID system (Control-IQ) followed by randomization 1:1 into two groups. Both groups&#xD;
      will have the same three interventions but will progress in the study in a different order&#xD;
      allowing for crossover comparisons. The three interventions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of personal CLC system for 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of personal CLC system and adding a behavioral adaptation module (BAM) for 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of personal CLC system and adding the ABC which includes: BAM and PAM (which&#xD;
           includes ATM and WST described below) for 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BAM will consist of modules in which information only is given to participants (e.g. time&#xD;
      in range, Glucose Management Indicator (GMI), hyper-and hypoglycemic risks, daily glycemic&#xD;
      profiles, and variability tracker). The PAM includes auto suggestions for titration of&#xD;
      insulin pump parameters every two weeks (ATM) and is aided by a web simulation tool (WST)&#xD;
      which can replay 'what if' scenarios for the participant based on various combinations of&#xD;
      insulin pump parameter changes.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome for this study is CGM-measured percent time in range 70-180 mg/dL over the last 4-week periods on CLC+ABC versus 2 weeks of the current CLC system. The intervention will be considered effective if the CLC+ABC is superior to the CLC alone in a crossover design using a statistical significance of α=0.05.&#xD;
To preserve the overall type 1 error for selected key secondary endpoints, a hierarchical testing procedure will be used. If the primary analysis for time in range described above results in a statistically significant result (p &lt; 0.05), then testing (similar to the model for the primary outcome) will proceed to the next key secondary outcome metric in the following order entered.</description>
