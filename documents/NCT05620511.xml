  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perceived loneliness causes a global health burden on older adults. Mindfulness training may&#xD;
      be a feasible solution. Through our study, we expect that comprehensive and convincing&#xD;
      neuroscientific evidence may support the efficacy underpinning mindfulness training in&#xD;
      loneliness reduction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this aging and highly industrial society, elderly depression, particularly elderly&#xD;
      loneliness, is a growing societal issue. Perceived loneliness not only causes tremendous&#xD;
      suffering, disability, cognitive decline, and risk of dementia but also leads to increased&#xD;
      mortality. Despite worldwide effort to solve the growing prevalence of loneliness in older&#xD;
      adults, no single intervention stands out as universally effective and practical. The exact&#xD;
      neural mechanism of loneliness and how the intervention against loneliness takes its effect&#xD;
      in the brain remain unclear. Prior studies have indicated that perceived loneliness is&#xD;
      associated with distorted cognition toward interpersonal interaction and heightened&#xD;
      sympathetic nerve system.Mindfulness training is a discipline that the older adults in our&#xD;
      society can readily relate to because the philosophy of mindfulness is similar to Buddhism.&#xD;
      Mindfulness trains people to be aware of the surrounding environment and their presence in&#xD;
      this environment. Combining the exercises of deep breathing and relaxation, one is taught to&#xD;
      be aware of the emotion of oneself to regulate emotion. Mindfulness-based stress reduction&#xD;
      (MBSR), a validated and systemized intervention, has been applied to the treatment of&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, and insomnia. On the basis of the theory of mindfulness, the&#xD;
      investigators estimate that mindfulness can reduce loneliness as well. Thus, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to use MBSR in a group of older adults with depression to reduce&#xD;
      loneliness. Our previous studies demonstrated that loneliness decreases the grey matter&#xD;
      volume in reward system, disrupts the white matter structure, and heightens default-mode&#xD;
      network activation. By combining a wearable device for sleep monitoring, heart rate&#xD;
      variability measurement, and immune-related cytokine blood test, the investigators can&#xD;
      associate these changes with clinical loneliness reduction and brain changes from magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging. The investigators hope to validate MBSR as an effective intervention&#xD;
      against loneliness and explore the supporting neural mechanism.&#xD;
