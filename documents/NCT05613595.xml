    <textblock>
      The Central idea of the proposed research proposal is first to translate adapt and validate&#xD;
      the Caregiver Difficulties Scale &amp; Positive Psychotherapy sessions based manual into Urdu&#xD;
      language then secondly, assessment of burnout, burden, depression, mental wellbeing, sense of&#xD;
      coherence and social support among caregivers of Cerebral palsy children and finally&#xD;
      measuring the effectiveness of Positive Psychotherapy for treating mental health issues of&#xD;
      caregivers of Cerebral Palsy children. This research proposal will provide an Urdu language&#xD;
      based standardized positive psycho therapeutic based intervention to mental health&#xD;
      practitioners for treating mental health issues of caregivers of cerebral palsy children in&#xD;
      sociocultural context of Pakistan. In Pakistan earlier conducted researches mainly focused on&#xD;
      assessment of mental health issues of caregivers of cerebral palsy children, however present&#xD;
      research will not only assess the sample regarding their mental health issues, but in&#xD;
      addition it will also contribute in provision of psychometrically sound Urdu language based&#xD;
      positive Psychotherapy. Positive Psychotherapy focuses on positive emotions and personal&#xD;
      strengths instead of ruminating over weaknesses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a congenital neurodevelopmental disorder, due to non-progressive&#xD;
      disability it prolongs throughout ages. Mental health of the caregivers of CP children is&#xD;
      affected due to prolong treatment of the child. Keeping in mind the long term multiple&#xD;
      disability in cerebral palsy much focus in earlier researches were given to the&#xD;
      rehabilitation of the child and less attention is given to address the mental health issues&#xD;
      of caregivers of cerebral palsy children. The current study is based on identifying the&#xD;
      mental health issues like depression, caregiver burden and burnout among caregivers of CP&#xD;
      children and how sense of coherence and social support have impact on the mental wellbeing of&#xD;
      caregivers of CP children. After measuring the level of mental health issues of care givers&#xD;
      of cerebral palsy children, the present study also aimed at rehabilitation of the caregivers&#xD;
      of cerebral palsy children with the help of positive psychotherapy in rehabilitation unit.&#xD;
      The positive psychotherapy based interventions will be translated and adapted in Urdu&#xD;
      language for the present study. According to the literature review no such positive&#xD;
      psychotherapy based techniques used on caregivers of CP Children in Pakistan. Positive&#xD;
      Psychotherapy is selected as an interventional therapy in the present study and for the first&#xD;
      time it has been planned for this sample in Pakistan. Core focus of positive psychotherapy is&#xD;
      to move away the client from negative aspect of life and focus them towards the positive&#xD;
      aspects of life. If positive psychotherapy treatment is effective as compared to traditional&#xD;
      treatment approach it will be cost effective and will reduce caregiver burden, depression and&#xD;
      burnout.&#xD;
