  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that serum FGF21 levels would increase with prolongation of&#xD;
      the fasting period. The investigators also hypothesized that food intake and body composition&#xD;
      would change. The study was conducted with 12 healthy male adults. A questionnaire was&#xD;
      administered at the beginning of the study. Anthropometric measurements, dietary intake and&#xD;
      physical activities were recorded and blood samples were taken before, during and after&#xD;
      Ramadan.&#xD;

      The aim of this study was to determine the effects of hunger on serum Fibroblast Growth&#xD;
      Factor 21 (FGF21) levels, nutritional status and anthropometric measurements of adult males&#xD;
      during fasting. FGF21 is a significant protein in the process of adaption to fasting due to&#xD;
      its effects on liver, adipose tissue, and brain. A total of 12 healthy individuals with&#xD;
      normal body mass index, between the ages of 18 to 35 participated to this cross-sectional&#xD;
      study. All participants provided written informed consent. Sample size determined with power&#xD;
      analysis. A questionnaire was administered in order to determine individuals' general&#xD;
      characteristics, nutrition habits, and smoking and alcohol habits. Anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements, 24 hours dietary recall and physical activities were recorded and blood samples&#xD;
      were taken four times in following periods; before Ramadan, first week of Ramadan, third week&#xD;
      of Ramadan and two weeks after Ramadan. Serum FGF21 levels were determined by ELISA&#xD;
      (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay). Mean energy and nutrient intake were calculated by BEBIS&#xD;
      (Nutrition Information System) and results were compared with Recommended Dietary Allowances&#xD;
      (RDA). Paired samples t-test and Wilcoxon-signed rank test were used to explore differences.&#xD;
      The study was approved by Hacettepe University Non-Interventional Clinical Research Ethics&#xD;
      Board.&#xD;
