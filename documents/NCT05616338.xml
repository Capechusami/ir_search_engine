  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is severe when it cannot be controlled with maximum-dose inhaled therapies while&#xD;
      management of comorbidities and other precipitating or aggravating factors has been&#xD;
      optimized. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a complex bronchopulmonary&#xD;
      disease resulting from immunological reactions against Aspergillus Fumigatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of a model of bronchial epithelium generated from patients with chronic lung&#xD;
      disease will allow the modeling of bronchial tissue to understand the formation of these&#xD;
      mucus plugs. This study aims to validate this model&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to verify the feasibility of obtaining and comparing two epithelia&#xD;
      in two populations based on the following experiments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differentiation of an Induced Pluripotent Stem cell (iPSC) clone derived from blood sample&#xD;
      (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) of Type 2 inflammation (T2) severe asthma and Allergic&#xD;
      Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA) in order to obtain differentiated bronchial epithelia&#xD;
      in vitro.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Asthma is severe when it cannot be controlled with maximum-dose inhaled therapies while&#xD;
      management of comorbidities and other precipitating or aggravating factors has been&#xD;
      optimized. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a complex bronchopulmonary&#xD;
      disease resulting from immunological reactions against Aspergillus Fumigatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the cellular and molecular level, severe asthma and ABPA are chronic bronchial diseases&#xD;
      characterized by type 2 (T2) airway inflammation, bronchial smooth muscle hyperplasia,&#xD;
      excessive mucus production by mucus cell metaplasia and epithelial remodeling. Type 2&#xD;
      inflammation in asthma is predominant and is characterized by the accumulation of immune&#xD;
      cells, such as eosinophils, mast cells, T-helper 2 (Th2) cells, innate lymphoid cells type 2&#xD;
      (ILC2s) and dendritic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistent airway obstruction despite maximal therapy is currently considered the greatest&#xD;
      unmet medical need in asthma treatment. Fahy and colleagues published a key paper in 2018&#xD;
      that may explain airway obstruction. Using chest CT scans, they demonstrated the presence of&#xD;
      mucus plugs that completely occlude segments of the airways of severe asthmatics. These mucus&#xD;
      plugs are associated with a high number of circulating eosinophils in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no large-scale model to model severe asthma and ABPA. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      develop a bronchial epithelium with pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) in air-liquid interface&#xD;
      called iALI generated from these patients in aim to model severe asthma and ABPA and in&#xD;
      particular the epithelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of the iPSC derived airway epithelium with nasal epithelial cells isolated&#xD;
           from the same patient (nasal brush).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the phenotype of the iPSC derived airway epithelium from ABPA and T2&#xD;
           severe asthma patient, in comparison to a healthy control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differentiation of iPSC into mature eosinophils&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Co culture of the epithelia with iPSC derived eosinophils&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Culture of iPSC derived airway epithelium with Charcot-Leyden crystal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining iPSC from peripheral blood sampling.&#xD;
