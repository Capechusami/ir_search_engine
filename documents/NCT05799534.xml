    <textblock>
      This intervention study aims to evaluate the before and after changes in physical fitness,&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory status, exercise capacity, fatigue, anxiety, dyspnea, psychoemotional&#xD;
      conditions, and quality of life through 3 sessions per week for 4-week of an intensive&#xD;
      therapeutic program in post coronavirus survivors. In addition, it aims to answer the main&#xD;
      questions before and after the clinical trial study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does three sessions per week for 4-week of an intensive therapeutic program improve&#xD;
           patients' physical fitness, cardiorespiratory status, and exercise capacity?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does it improve physical endurance and fitness, enhancing fatigue, anxiety, and dyspnea&#xD;
           on post coronavirus patients? Participants will ask first to answer these questionnaires&#xD;
           before and after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Berg Balance Scale (BBS): to assess the patient's ability (or inability) to safely&#xD;
           balance (standing, active, and fall risk) during a series of planned tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale: is used to assess patients'&#xD;
           degree of baseline functional impairment due to dyspnea from respiratory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale- 21 Items (DASS-21): measures the emotional states&#xD;
           of depression, anxiety, and stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS): evaluates symptoms of chronic fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of Life (QOL)-short form-36: to assess the quality of life and calculate eight&#xD;
           subscales: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality,&#xD;
           social functioning, role emotional, and mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After answering the questionnaires, the patients will then go through multiple tests before&#xD;
      and after the intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 6-min walk test (6-MWT): is the primary measure of this study to assess aerobic&#xD;
           capacity and endurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10-meter walk test (10MWT): assess walking speed in meters per second over a short&#xD;
           distance and assess capacity and endurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time Up and Go (TUG) test: assess lower extremity function, mobility, and fall risk. The&#xD;
           TUG test is the shortest, most straightforward clinical balance test available to&#xD;
           predict the risk of falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1-min sit-to-stand test (1-MSTST): assess lower extremity strength for one minute.&#xD;

      The intervention will include all of the following exercises:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Breathing Exercises:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Breathing control:&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Start with the breathing exercises at least twice a day, and increase to 4-6&#xD;
                times a day&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Breathe in and out gently through the nose if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  If the breath is out through the mouth, the participant will instruct to purse&#xD;
                     their lips as if they are blowing out a candle&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Attempt to release any tension in the body with each exhalation&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Gradually try to make the breaths slower&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Each participant will instruct to close their eyes to help focus on breathing&#xD;
                     and to relax&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Deep breathing exercises&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The participant will be instructed to take long, slow, and deep breaths&#xD;
                     through their nose and keep their chest and shoulders relaxed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Breathe out gently and relax, like a sigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  They should do three-five deep breaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Repeat for two minutes several times a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Huffing • A huff is exhaled through an open mouth and throat instead of coughing.&#xD;
                It helps move sputum up the participants' airways so they can clear it in a&#xD;
                controlled way.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  To &quot;huff,&quot; they must squeeze air quickly from their lungs through their open&#xD;
                     mouth and throat as if trying to mist up a mirror or glasses.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Use their abdominal muscles to assist them in squeezing out the air, but do&#xD;
                     not exert so much force that it causes wheezing or chest tightness.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  If huffing clears their sputum, they should not need to cough. They should&#xD;
                     only cough if the sputum can clear quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The participants should continue the breathing exercises for about 10 minutes,&#xD;
                     ideally until their chest feels clear of sputum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Strengthening Exercises&#xD;
&#xD;
           - To help restore muscle strength and increase endurance for 3 minutes daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Standing heel raise: hold on a chair, integrate arms reaching overhead when on&#xD;
                toes. Repeat 2-3 times. Increase gradually to 8 Times (1-set)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mini squats holding the chair with breathing&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Wall push-ups hold for 8 seconds, then repetitions 2-3 times and increase to 10&#xD;
                repetitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For core exercises, start with 1-2 repetitions, then slowly increase to 10&#xD;
                repetitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sit to stand and repeat 2-3 times. Increase gradually to 10-times&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mobility training or gait training&#xD;
&#xD;
           - To increase endurance&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Walk for at least 30 minutes without stopping five times per week&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Start by walking on flat surfaces. As they progress and gain endurance, increase&#xD;
                challenge by walking on hills and inclines for a 10-minute increase to 3 times a&#xD;
                day.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ascending and descending stairs with assistance if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Home-exercise program (HEP) • All the activities above should continue at home&#xD;
