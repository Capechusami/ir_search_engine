      This is a national multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial to show superiority&#xD;
      of edge-to-edge Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve repair (TTVr) on top of the Standard Of Care&#xD;
      (SOC; heart failure medication) over the SOC alone in patients with symptomatic severe&#xD;
      Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR) in the Netherlands.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR) is a common heart valve disease associated with mortality,&#xD;
      heart failure hospitalization (HHF) and a significant negative impact on quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL). The prevalence of moderate or severe TR in the Netherlands is estimated at 0.55% and&#xD;
      becoming more prevalent. Surgery is rarely performed, because in-hospital mortality is high&#xD;
      and there is little evidence for the efficacy. The majority of patients does therefore&#xD;
      entirely dependent on treatment with heart failure medication. However, a subset of these&#xD;
      patients experience (progressive) symptoms of refractory congestive heart failure despite the&#xD;
      SOC with heart failure medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve repair (TTVr) offers several new strategies to address severe&#xD;
      TR; one promising technique to treat patients with symptomatic severe TR is edge-to-edge&#xD;
      tricuspid valve (TV) repair through leaflet approximation. Edge-to-edge TTVr may provide an&#xD;
      elegant alternative treatment for many patients, because it is less burdensome due to the&#xD;
      minimally invasive nature. Moreover, multiple single-arm trials already reported promising&#xD;
      outcomes in terms of efficacy and safety, and the technique is very similar to Transcatheter&#xD;
      Mitral Valve repair (TMVr), with yet proven feasibility, efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of TTVr for&#xD;
      patients with symptomatic severe TR despite the SOC and high/prohibitive surgical risk in the&#xD;
      Netherlands.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. The patient is symptomatic (New York Heart Association Functional Class II, III or&#xD;
             ambulatory class IV) despite Standard Of Care (SOC). The Central Screening Committee&#xD;
             (CSC) will assess whether the patient is receiving SOC. The CSC will also ensure that&#xD;
             in case of the presence of atrial fibrillation, left sided heart valve disease (not&#xD;
             requiring intervention) or coronary artery disease, conditions are first treated&#xD;
             adequately with medication and/or (surgical) intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient suffers from â‰¥ grade 3 isolated TR as determined by the assessment of a&#xD;
             qualifying transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and three-dimensional transesophageal&#xD;
             echocardiogram (3DTEE) and confirmed by the CSC, according to European Association for&#xD;
             Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (Tricuspid Focus Group) consensus document&#xD;
             (in press). Note: If cardiac procedure(s) occur after eligibility was determined, TR&#xD;

             leaflets (no clip placement possible), pacemaker or Implantable Cardioverter&#xD;
             Defibrillator (ICD) leads that would prevent appropriate placement or visualization of&#xD;
             TTVr devices, Ebstein Anomaly (normal annulus position, but valve leaflets attached to&#xD;
             walls and septum of the right ventricle), tricuspid valve anatomy non evaluable by&#xD;
             echo, known allergy or hypersensitivity to dual antiplatelet therapy AND anticoagulant&#xD;
