      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Purpose: the investigators propose studies of a tiny, wearable, wireless,&#xD;
      beat-to-beat blood pressure monitor that will be both a transformative research platform and&#xD;
      an enabler of patient self-care in the diagnosis, investigation, and management of POTS. The&#xD;
      2019 NIH POTS Consensus meeting stated the need for biomarkers that would i) provide&#xD;
      physiologically-based diagnostic criteria; ii) be easily accessible and affordable; iii)&#xD;
      reflect disease activity and response to treatment, and provide long-term outcome data; and&#xD;
      iv) provide uniform phenotyping and a shared database for multicenter studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current POTS heart rate (HR) diagnostic criteria may not reflect hemodynamic changes in daily&#xD;
      life, and do not measure the underlining physiology, which is reduced stroke volume (SV) in&#xD;
      most patients. Beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) recordings with waveforms can derive SV. the&#xD;
      investigators have developed an inexpensive, wearable, wireless, rechargeable, beat-to-beat&#xD;
      BP monitor that sits behind the ear. It weighs 13 gm and samples the BP with high resolution&#xD;
      waveforms. SV can be estimated from BP waveform shapes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objectives: the investigators hypothesize that SV 1) can be estimated from wearable&#xD;
      BP monitors, and 2) will provide physiologic information for patients and physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine the accuracy of stroke volume estimated from a novel wearable BP monitor&#xD;
      compared to that estimated from cardiac MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine whether stroke volume differs between healthy controls and POTS subjects&#xD;
      during stand tests in the lab and at home Aim 3: To determine whether stroke volume&#xD;
      correlates with heart rate at home Aim 4: To assess user satisfaction in a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design &amp; Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Noninvasive BP waveforms will be acquired from 30 patients undergoing cardiac MRI. to&#xD;
      provide accurate SV estimates. BP waveforms will be digitized at 50 Hz and SV will be&#xD;
      estimated from BP waveforms with both published equations using parameters of the waveforms&#xD;
      and with de novo algorithms developed using Matlab machine learning regression algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: SV and HR will be recorded after 10 min headup tilt and the stand test from 20 POTS&#xD;
      patients and 20 healthy controls. The same parameters will be recorded at home after 10 min&#xD;
      quiet standing. the investigators will compare the home stand test and lab tilt test and&#xD;
      stand tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: the investigators will have the 20 symptomatic POTS patients and 20 healthy controls&#xD;
      from Aim 2 wear the novel monitor for 12 daytime hours. the investigators will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that stroke volumes are lower and heart rate higher in 10-minute segments in the&#xD;
      morning after arising and better in mid afternoon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Devices will be provided to 3 centers who will each enroll 5 POTS patients and 5&#xD;
      control subjects. The devices will be worn for 12 daytime hours and the data stored&#xD;
      anonymously in the cloud. Patients and physicians will be surveyed for their impressions of&#xD;
      wearability, esthetics, comfort, and ease of donning and doffing, as well as data handling&#xD;
      and review. Investigators will be given access to the anonymized, searchable, explorable data&#xD;
      set and a draft Ambulatory POTS Monitor report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Outcomes: This proposed work will provide an easily accessible, affordable&#xD;
      platform for multicentre, physiologically-based studies of diagnosis, treatment, and&#xD;
      long-term outcome. This will enable hemodynamic monitoring of POTS patients at home.&#xD;
