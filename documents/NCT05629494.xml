  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men in the Unites States. Nearly 1&#xD;
      million prostate biopsy procedures are performed in the United States annually and elevated&#xD;
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level is the primary reason for prostate biopsy in &gt; 90% of&#xD;
      cases. However, at the PSA levels which trigger prostate biopsy, often no cancer is found in&#xD;
      prostate biopsy specimens. PSA test can be elevated due to reasons other than cancer such as&#xD;
      inflammation or natural variation in the level. Investigators plan to treat men with elevated&#xD;
      PSA level with over the counter anti-inflammatory medications (ibuprofen, naproxen) to see if&#xD;
      the PSA level will decrease to an acceptable level.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It's known that PSA level can be elevated due to reasons other than prostate cancer including&#xD;
      benign prostatic hypertrophy, prostatitis or other urinary tract infections, non-infectious&#xD;
      inflammation, and physiologic variation over time. Consequently, nearly 50% of prostate&#xD;
      biopsy procedures performed due to elevated PSA level do not yield any cancer , but still&#xD;
      expose the patients to the risks of the procedure related complications (discomfort/pain,&#xD;
      anxiety, bleeding, infection, and cost). Thus, measures to improve the reliability of PSA&#xD;
      test, and potentially avoiding unnecessary procedures, are of significant importance to the&#xD;
      patient and healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is common practice to check PSA level annually. PSA test results can vary over time,&#xD;
      either due to the imprecision in the analysis and/or due to the biologic variability. This&#xD;
      can result in an apparent rise in PSA level when no clinically meaningful rise had occurred.&#xD;
      Its estimated that the average lab variation in PSA was approximately 6% and the average&#xD;
      biologic variation about 14%. This, it is recommended that isolated elevation in PSA level&#xD;
      should be confirmed after several weeks, and before proceeding with further interventions,&#xD;
      including prostate biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-clinical, histologic Inflammation (presence of inflammatory cells) within the prostate&#xD;
      tissue and its effect on PSA level has been reported in various settings. In two&#xD;
      population-based studies, men who were regularly using over the counter (OTC) nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g ibuprofen, naproxen) had lower PSA levels compared to&#xD;
      non-users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, two strategies are utilized in clinical practice to ensure that the PSA level is&#xD;
      truly elevated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Repeat PSA test after several weeks or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A short course of OTC NSAIDs, and then repeat PSA test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose to conduct a randomized study to determine the effect of NSAIDs on PSA&#xD;
      level compared to the biologic variations in PSA level noted upon repeat testing.&#xD;
