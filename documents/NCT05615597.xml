  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is a major cause of chronic low back pain (&gt; 40%). It can be&#xD;
      defined by specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, with a strong correlation&#xD;
      between pain and the inflammatory aspect of the disc, resulting in active disc disease (AD).&#xD;
      The Modic classification based on MRI of the lumbar spine is considered a reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of low back pain in patients with inflammatory disc disease generally involves&#xD;
      intra-disc corticosteroid infiltration, which has been widely proven to be effective in&#xD;
      reducing pain [4-6]. However, this procedure can be painful and invasive and sometimes&#xD;
      impossible to perform due to severe disc impingement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy on pain of para-disc infiltration of&#xD;
      corticosteroids in contact with the inflammatory MRI signal abnormality (Modic 1) when it is&#xD;
      lateralized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This variant of infiltration is easier to perform (no catheterisation of the disc and&#xD;
      therefore quicker), would entail less risk of disc infection and would be accessible to more&#xD;
      radiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is already practised but, to our knowledge, has never been the subject of a study to&#xD;
      evaluate its effectiveness on pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If successful, more patients could be treated and the range of treatment could be extended.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 month after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is a validated questionnaire (Fairbank and Pynsent 2000). We will consider a patient as responder if he/she manages to achieve at least 30% improvement in ODI score between baseline and 1 month. This percentage of minimal improvement (30%) was judged to be a clinically relevant threshold by an international consensus conference (Ostelo et al. 2008).</description>
