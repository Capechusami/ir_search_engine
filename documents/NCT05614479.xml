      The GATEKEEPER project, funded by the European Commission's HORIZON 2020 innovation&#xD;
      framework, aims to ensure healthier independent living for ageing populations. To this end,&#xD;
      GATEKEEPER aims to develop an open, European-wide, standards-based, interoperable and secure&#xD;
      platform, available to all stakeholders (healthcare professionals, technology companies and&#xD;
      users), offering digital solutions on the Internet of Things, Big Data or Artificial&#xD;
      Intelligence, or new techniques, for early detection and personalised interventions to ensure&#xD;
      healthier independent living for ageing populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GATEKEEPER will demonstrate its value by scaling up innovative solutions, during a 48-month&#xD;
      work plan that will involve 40.000 elderly citizens, as well as authorities, institutions,&#xD;
      companies, associations and academic centres from 8 pilot regions in 7 EU Member States. The&#xD;
      pilots sites will deploy and demonstrate the effect, benefit, value and scalability of&#xD;
      GATEKEEPER solutions around reference use cases covering primary, secondary and terciary&#xD;
      prevention in the Basque Country (Spain), Aragon (Spain), Attica and Central Greece (Greece),&#xD;
      Cyprus (Cyprus), Lodz (Poland), Milton Keynes (UK), Puglia (Italy) and Saxony (Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Basque Country pilot site is involved in the Reference Use Cases focused to&#xD;
      &quot;Lifestyle-related early detection&quot;. The intervention aims to encourage active and healthy&#xD;
      ageing by the use of a self-managed mobile application, thereby to enhance independence,&#xD;
      autonomy and improve the well-being of older people, promoting their physical, cognitive and&#xD;
      mental activity and social participation. This quasi-experimental and longitudinal study is&#xD;
      target to 10,000 older people and/or their caregivers from the Basque Country region. A&#xD;
      multi-channel and community-based recruitment strategy at Basque regional level has been&#xD;
      designed that involves 39 community-based organizations from the Basque Health Ecosystem.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population over 65 years of age in OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and&#xD;
      Development) countries has been increasing in recent years. In 2010 it was 15% and is&#xD;
      expected to reach 22% by 2030. Life expectancy of people aged 65 has also increased&#xD;
      significantly over the last 50 years, being higher in OECD countries, with women living 21&#xD;
      years longer and men 17 years longer, representing an increase of almost 40% since 1960. This&#xD;
      demographic change of society in the European Union (EU) leads to increased costs in health&#xD;
      and social care systems, as care and prevention measures for all ages are becoming&#xD;
      increasingly expensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To tackle this challege, health systems should identify solutions that improve the lifelong&#xD;
      health and well-being of elderly people, and hence the effectiveness of prevention, treatment&#xD;
      and management of disease and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The European funded GATEKEEPER project aims to ensure healthier independent living for ageing&#xD;
      populations. As a result, GATEKEEPER will deploy an open, European-wide, standards-based,&#xD;
      interoperable and secure platform, available to all stakeholders (healthcare professionals,&#xD;
      technology companies and users), offering digital solutions on the Internet of Things, Big&#xD;
      Data or Artificial Intelligence, or new techniques, for early detection and personalised&#xD;
      interventions to ensure healthier independent living for ageing populations. The study will&#xD;
      engage 40,000 senior citizens, as well as authorities, institutions, companies, associations&#xD;
      and academic centres from 8 pilot regions in seven medical use cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Basque Country region participates the &quot;Lifestyle-related early detection&quot; use case. It&#xD;
      has implemented a health promotion intervention to encourage active and healthy ageing of&#xD;
      Basque elderly people by the use of a self-managed MAHA mobile application. The main&#xD;
      objective is to assess the effectiveness and user experience of a self-managed mobile health&#xD;
      application that recommends activities to promote healthy lifestyle habits. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To encourage active and healthy ageing, promoting physical activity, cognitive training&#xD;
           and social participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To enhance independence, autonomy and improve the well-being of older people.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To increase the empowerment of older people and their caregivers, family members or&#xD;
           reference people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This quasi-experimental and longitudinal study is aiming to target 10,000 older people and/or&#xD;
      their caregivers from the Basque Country (Spain). Recruitment will follow a multi-channel and&#xD;
      community based strategy at Basque regional level. More than 25 community based organizations&#xD;
      from the Basque Health Ecosystem are participating in the intervention. The professionals as&#xD;
      recruiters disseminate the intervention and invite participants who meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria (people over 65 years old and/or caregivers that are familiar with mobile and&#xD;
      technologies) to use the ehealth Appl for improving their health, daily habits and enhance&#xD;
      health literacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have a total duration of 24 months structures in three phases: intervention&#xD;
      design and preparation; running phase, and evaluation process. In the 1st phase, the process&#xD;
      of adapting and customising the technology to the needs of the study has been carried out. In&#xD;
      parallel, professionals from key organizations at community setting has been invited to&#xD;
      participate in the development, identification and review of the contents, usability and&#xD;
      interface of the App mock-ups. In the 2nd phase, as part of the intervention running phase,&#xD;
      traning sessions with healthcare professionals and community-based professionals have been&#xD;
      carried out. Trained professionals through dissemination materials and channels (posters,&#xD;
      explanatory leaflets, videos, newsletters or face-to-face appointments) start contacting and&#xD;
      informing the study candidates to participate in the intervention. Candidates who are&#xD;
      interest and accept to participate will download the application on their mobile devices and&#xD;
      start using MAHA. The 3rd and last phase will conduct an evaluation where the intervention&#xD;
      research question will be answered. The research question is: Can ehealth mobile application&#xD;
      promote habits and attitudes that lead to healthy lifestyles, enchace independence, and&#xD;
      autonomy and increase the empowerment among elderly people? The intervention aforementioned&#xD;
      started in April 2022, once traning sessions with the profesionals at community-based&#xD;
      organizations held. The project envisages between six and 9 month window from the start of&#xD;
      the intervention to achieve the total number of citizen recruited. During the intervention&#xD;
      period, citizen will use the MAHA App that will offer activities, materials and contents to&#xD;
      reinforce the socialization, promote habits and attitudes that lead to healthy lifestyles,&#xD;
      push active ageing and empowerment, and delay or reduce the deterioration of the health. The&#xD;
      intervention will end in September 2023, after which the evaluation will be carried out to&#xD;
      analyse if MAHA has contributed to make senior healthier and make healthy choices easier! A&#xD;
      mixed methods approach will be employed, which refers to an emerging research methodology&#xD;
      that advances the systematic integration of quantitative and qualitative data into a single&#xD;
      investigation. Data collected from participants' MAHA application will be used for&#xD;
      quantitative evaluation. It will be conducted a baseline assessment, by collecting the&#xD;
      following questionnaires at baseline, one the participant has registered in the App:&#xD;
      EuroQoL-5D and Get up from the chair 5 times test from the app server. The final evaluation&#xD;
      will take place at the end of the defined monitoring period. This evaluation will be based on&#xD;
      information from quantitative data collected through questionnaires (EuroQoL-5D, Get up from&#xD;
      your chair 5 times test and MAUQ) and usage metrics from the app server.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management comply with the new EU regulation on data protection (General Data Protection&#xD;
      Regulation, GDPR) that has entered into force on 28 May 2018. The GATEKEEPER I study will&#xD;
      only collect essential data that will come from the app server (all data extracted from the&#xD;
      app server and used for analysis will be anonymised) and information from focus groups and/or&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews with professionals practitioners (data for analysis will be&#xD;
      pseudonymised). This data processing will be carried out in accordance with the data&#xD;
      protection regulation no. 2016/679. Only those responsible for the evaluation&#xD;
      (Osakidetza-Basque Health Service) of the Basque Country team will have access to&#xD;
      identifiable data in a protected environment. Those responsible for the evaluation will sign&#xD;
      an express commitment to confidentiality and not to carry out any re-identification activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      App user data transferred to the evaluation team (Open Evidence, the Gatekeeper partner&#xD;
      responsible for the evaluation of the project) and usage metrics transferred to the&#xD;
      Gatekeeper platform (hosted by the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, a GATEKEEPER partner)&#xD;
      will be anonymised. The data transfer mechanisms between European regions will comply with&#xD;
      the new EU regulation on data protection (General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) that has&#xD;
      entered into force on 28 May 2018.&#xD;
