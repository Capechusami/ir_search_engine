    <textblock>
      The project aims to provide an overview of injury and illnesses during the FIFA World Cup&#xD;
      Qatar 2022. All teams are invited to participate and record details on time-loss injury and&#xD;
      illness occurrence and training and match exposure during the tournament. In order to assess&#xD;
      the severity of injuries (based on the length of time a player is unable to play for), all&#xD;
      injuries are to be monitored until they are fully rehabilitated, even if this is after the&#xD;
      end of the tournament. This information will be recorded by the team physicians and provided&#xD;
      on daily report forms to the research team. Data will be encrypted before analysis and only&#xD;
      anonymized data will be published. Descriptive statistics are used to provide an overview of&#xD;
      the participant demographics and injury and illness occurrence. Injury incidence is&#xD;
      calculated as number of injuries per 1000 hours of exposure, and injury burden is calculated&#xD;
      as time-loss days per 1000 hours of exposure. Injury incidence and burden will be reported&#xD;
      for training and match injuries separately. Illness incidence is calculated per 365 exposure&#xD;
      days.&#xD;

      Background Injury rates in football are closely associated with team performance. Teams are&#xD;
      more likely to lose matches in which they have suffered injuries, and teams with fewer&#xD;
      injuries have significantly better results both in international tournaments and in national&#xD;
      leagues. Injuries can have both high short- and long-term consequences for an individual&#xD;
      player's health and career. Illness rates in professional football is lower than injury&#xD;
      rates, but it is unclear whether illness rates are higher in international tournaments, which&#xD;
      often include travel, exposure to different environments, high match significance, and match&#xD;
      congestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injury surveillance is a cornerstone in the development of injury prevention programs. Injury&#xD;
      and illness prevention strategies are continuously being developed and improved, and it is&#xD;
      therefore important with ongoing surveillance. Additionally, there has been scientific&#xD;
      advances in methodology, which can ensure more detailed and accurate information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The primary objective is to provide an overview of the incidence and&#xD;
      characteristics of time-loss injuries and illnesses during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary variables of interest are time-loss injuries and time-loss illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time-loss is defined as inability of a player to complete the current or future training&#xD;
           session or match.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Injury is defined as tissue damage or other derangement of normal physical function&#xD;
           resulting from rapid or repetitive transfer of kinetic energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Illness is defined as a health-related complaint or disorder experienced by an athlete,&#xD;
           not considered as an injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim is to analyse injury mechanisms through match video footage of the observed&#xD;
      time-loss injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design Prospective observational cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project will be performed at the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, which is played&#xD;
      November 20th and December 18th, 2022 in Qatar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration The study will start from the first day of training with the national team&#xD;
      prior the tournament until the day of the last match of the tournament. Consequently, the&#xD;
      number of recordings will vary between teams depending on the duration of their&#xD;
      pre-tournament training (usually 1-3 weeks), and their performance and progression through&#xD;
      the tournament. In order to assess the severity of injuries (based on the length of time a&#xD;
      player is unable to play for), all injuries are to be recorded until they are fully&#xD;
      rehabilitated, even if this is after the end of the tournament. Each contact person therefore&#xD;
      also needs to report when an injured player who has left the tournament has returned to full&#xD;
      training with their club team after the tournament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic information Individual demographic information, including age, height, weight,&#xD;
      playing position, and leg dominance (preferred kicking leg), is collected following&#xD;
      inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injury &amp; illness registration Data on injury and illness is gathered following the&#xD;
      recommended methodology in the football extension of the International Olympic Committee&#xD;
      consensus statement on methods for recording and reporting of epidemiological data on injury&#xD;
      and illness in sport. This includes characteristics such as mode of onset, injury mechanism,&#xD;
      diagnosis and classification according to body area, tissue, and pathology type, and illness&#xD;
      categories for organ system and etiology. Time-loss will be counted in number of days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure registration Training and match exposure will be recorded in minutes for each&#xD;
      participant for the duration of the tournament. Training exposure includes for example any&#xD;
      sports-specific training, strength and conditioning sessions, and active recovery sessions.&#xD;
      Illness exposure will be recorded in days for each participant from their first day of&#xD;
      training until their last match.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics is used to provide an overview of the participant demographics and&#xD;
      injury and illness occurrence. Injury incidence is calculated as number of injuries per 1000&#xD;
      hours of exposure, and injury burden is calculated as time-loss days per 1000 hours of&#xD;
      exposure. Injury incidence and burden will be reported for training and match injuries&#xD;
      separately. Illness incidence is calculated per 365 exposure days. Potential missing data&#xD;
      will be excluded from analysis and reported accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size No a priori sample size calculation is performed as we will attempt to include&#xD;
      all eligible participants.&#xD;
