  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monkey pox virus (MPXV), of the genus Orthopoxvirus, regularly causes epidemics in endemic&#xD;
      areas of central and western Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since January 1, 2022, cases of Monkey pox have been reported to WHO by 96 Member States in&#xD;
      the 6 WHO regions. As of 22 August 2022, a total of 41,664 laboratory-confirmed cases and 192&#xD;
      probable cases, including 12 deaths, have been reported to WHO. Since May 13, 2022, a high&#xD;
      proportion of these cases have been reported from countries where monkey pox transmission had&#xD;
      not previously been documented. For the first time, cases and sustained chains of&#xD;
      transmission are being reported in countries without direct or immediate epidemiological&#xD;
      links to areas in West or Central Africa (WHO 2022). France is one of the most affected&#xD;
      countries with 2889 cases reported as of August 22, 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This situation led the WHO Director General to declare, on July 23, 2022, that the monkeypox&#xD;
      epidemic currently affecting several countries constitutes a Public Health Emergency of&#xD;
      International Concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this epidemic, the WHO has recommended Post Exposure Vaccination (PEP) and Pre&#xD;
      Exposure Vaccination (PrEP) for at risk groups with 2nd and 3rd generation vaccines. In&#xD;
      France, the Haute Autorité de Santé (French National Authority for Health) recommended on May&#xD;
      20, 2022, vaccination for PEP and on July 7, 2022, for PrEP with a 3rd generation MVA-BN&#xD;
      vaccine (Imvanex® or Jynneos®). The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved the use of&#xD;
      Imvanex® on July 22, 2022 for immunization against MPXV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the present study is to describe the clinical, biological, virological,&#xD;
      pathophysiological and immunological aspects in the short and medium term of persons&#xD;
      vaccinated against and infected with MPXV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Descriptive, prospective, monocentric, longitudinal study. Subjects will be enrolled during&#xD;
      their consultation at CMIP as part of their curative or preventive management of MPXV&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of the appointment dedicated to vaccination or as part of the diagnosis of the&#xD;
      infection, the clinician will explain the study in progress and will propose to the&#xD;
      individual to participate if he/she is eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If so, after signing the informed consent form, the individual will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of socio-demographic, clinical and treatment data will be done on an eCRF at&#xD;
      each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological samples (blood and/or urine samples and/or swabs for viruses) will also be taken&#xD;
      at each study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples will be used for the following biological analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  serological analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sero-neutralization analysis by different techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cytometric analyses and biomarker measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  virological analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  genetic analysis.&#xD;
