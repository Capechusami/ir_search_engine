  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer represents a major public health problem in France because of its high&#xD;
      incidence and severe prognosis. Early stages of the disease are well know and have justified&#xD;
      the establishment of a mass screening strategy. Unfortunately, the factors determining the&#xD;
      progression to metastatic disease about them much harder to grasp. Various prognostic factors&#xD;
      and predictors of treatment response have been identified and are being used but most of them&#xD;
      are In practice, they are sometimes coarse and relatively little discriminant for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now possible to directly quantify the amount of circulating tumor cells in peripheral&#xD;
      blood. Quantification of circulating tumor cells beyond a threshold of 3 cells/7,5 ml has&#xD;
      been established as a major prognostic factor, and the rapid decrease in the number of these&#xD;
      cells under treatment is also a predictor of response for patients suffering from metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer . Furthermore, it has also been shown that the quality and importance of&#xD;
      the systemic and peritumoral inflammatory response in carcinomas, including colorectal,&#xD;
      played a key role in the prognosis of patients. In particular, the presence of high levels of&#xD;
      blood neutrophils has been raised by many studies as being followed by a poorer prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the correlation between the presence of circulating tumor cells and high levels of&#xD;
      neutrophils has never been studied. There is a rational to assume that this association&#xD;
      exists, and secondly that the presence of circulating tumor cells in a proinflammatory&#xD;
      environment represented by a high levels of blood neutrophils promotes metastasis by exerting&#xD;
      a negative synergistic effect on the prognosis of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this pilot study is to find a correlation between the amount of&#xD;
      circulating neutrophils and the presence of circulating tumor cells in patients with colon&#xD;
      cancer metastatic unresectable non-pretreated. The secondary objective is to investigate&#xD;
      whether this association results in a negative synergistic effect in terms of&#xD;
      progression-free survival and survival to one year. This is a non-interventional study. The&#xD;
      investigators expect the inclusion in one year of thirty patients in two centers (University&#xD;
      Hospital Centre Antoine Lacassagne Nice) to achieve these goals.&#xD;
