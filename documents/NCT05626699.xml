    <textblock>
      Respiratory Therapists (RTs) have difficulty maintaining compliance with protocols and making&#xD;
      efficient handoff communication. This project will evaluate the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      electronic tool that will display a dashboard of key information on all the RTs patients and&#xD;
      provide reminders that indicate whether evidence-based practice protocols are being followed.&#xD;
      In addition, it will collect data from medical devices and the EMR and outline key&#xD;
      information in the appropriate format to help standardize and improve handoff communication.&#xD;
      The study will first collect blind baseline data for comparison with protocol adherence and&#xD;
      silently evaluate shift change handoffs. In the second stage, the electronic tool will be&#xD;
      installed and used to evaluate whether protocol compliance and shift change handoff is&#xD;
      improved.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory Therapists (RTs) face challenges to provide high quality patient care including&#xD;
      maintaining compliance with evidence-based practice protocols using lung protective&#xD;
      ventilation (LPV) (tidal volume [VT] 4 to 8 ml predicted body weight and plateau pressure&#xD;
      [Pplt] &lt; 30 cm H2O), efficient communication during patient handoffs at shift changes and&#xD;
      maintaining situational awareness amidst a high patient-to-clinician ratio and elevated&#xD;
      acuity of patient care. Lung-protective ventilation (LPV) guidelines, initially published by&#xD;
      ARDS Net and supported by the American Thoracic Society, Society of Critical Care Medicine&#xD;
      and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. LPV guidelines recommend use of low tidal&#xD;
      volume (VT) (6 to 8 ml predicted body weight [PBW]) and inspiratory plateau pressure (Pplt)&#xD;
      (â‰¤ 30 cm H2O), proven to lower mortality in patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome&#xD;
      (ARDS). However, several studies revealed that many clinicians and institutions are not&#xD;
      effectively implementing LPV guidelines many years after their publication in the New England&#xD;
      Journal of Medicine in 2000. Clinicians who are unable and/or unwilling to apply low VT and&#xD;
      Pplt as defined above jeopardize patient safety and risk increased mortality. One study found&#xD;
      only 27% of patients received low VT and Pplt within 48 hours of the onset of ARDS. It was&#xD;
      also found that &quot;. . . adoption of evidence-based mechanical ventilation in real world&#xD;
      practice has been disturbingly slow.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another daily challenge faced by an RRT is the transfer of vital patient information during&#xD;
      shift changes. A less than optimal &quot;patient hand-off&quot; or communication of relevant patient&#xD;
      care information during shift changes appears to be a major factor in preventable medical&#xD;
      errors directly affecting patient safety. The primary objective of a patient hand-off is to&#xD;
      provide accurate information about the patient's care, treatment and services, current&#xD;
      condition and any recent or anticipated changes. While appearing to be relatively easy task,&#xD;
      a comprehensive, high-quality patient hand-off can be a complex communication procedure. One&#xD;
      study found that patient hand-off communication failures were responsible for 30% of&#xD;
      malpractice claims in U.S. hospitals, resulting in 1,744 deaths and $1.7 billion in&#xD;
      malpractice costs over five years. While the use of computerized patient handoff methods are&#xD;
      likely to promote improved information transfer during patient hand-offs, there is a dearth&#xD;
      of such easy-to-use, portable communication tools available for RTs. Other contributing&#xD;
      factors adversely affecting patient hand-off communication appear to be unrecognized patient&#xD;
      needs due to lack of accurate and real time electronic monitoring, task interruption from&#xD;
      nuisance alarms and inability to quickly determine the correct clinical decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RT Assistant, a bedside, portable and hand-held electronic tool, was designed to help the RT&#xD;
      with these challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the clinical effectiveness of RT Assistant software for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintaining patients according to established LPV guidelines for ventilator-dependent&#xD;
      patients Maintaining established low oxygen therapy guidelines Improving patient shift report&#xD;
      communication Collect baseline data from the selected ICU passively through the SickBay data&#xD;
      aggregator, including percentage of time patients are within the LPV and oxygenation&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collect baseline data on shift report quality by passively monitoring shift reports between&#xD;
      RTs during the above baseline data collection Install the RT Assistant software, train&#xD;
      participating RTs, and compare baseline data with the same data collected in the same ICU&#xD;
      during the use of the RT Assistant software&#xD;

The RRTs will then be given a likert scale questionnaire on the use of the RT Assistant.</description>
