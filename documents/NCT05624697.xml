  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      10 Patients having horizontally deficient anterior maxillary areas will be recruited and a&#xD;
      preoperative CBCT will be done. The plan is to graft the defective ridges with simultaneously&#xD;
      placing dental implants using a PEEK shell that will be specifically designed, constructed&#xD;
      and 3D printed to act as a surgical guide for osteotomy drilling and implant placement as&#xD;
      well as housing both the implant and the sticky bone (using a mixture of autogenous bone&#xD;
      harvested from the symphysis area and xenograft both mixed with plasmatic matrix); that will&#xD;
      be added to augment the defective ridge; the PEEK shell will also act as a barrier membrane&#xD;
      for Guided Bone Regeneration and will add more stability to the placed implants that will be&#xD;
      fixed to the PEEK shell occlusally with a Ti - based abutment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary stability will be measured using Ostell and an immediate postoperative CBCT will be&#xD;
      done and superimposed on the preoperative CBCT and an accuracy of plan transfer will be&#xD;
      measured to make sure the planning was followed accurately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then 6 months later, another CBCT will be done to check the bone gain and quality and a&#xD;
      second surgery will be done to remove the PEEK shell and proceed with the conventional&#xD;
      implant prosthetic phase.&#xD;
