      Kinesio tape is used successfully in the control of edema related to the extremity,&#xD;
      especially in the control of lymphedema that develops after surgery.Kinesiotape is a&#xD;
      non-allergic elastic tape applied to the skin surface.There are publications showing that&#xD;
      kinesio tape applications are beneficial for edema control after interventional procedures&#xD;
      such as anterior cruciate ligament surgery and knee prosthesis related to orthopedic surgical&#xD;
      interventions. There is no publication on the effectiveness of kinesio tape application in&#xD;
      the control and rehabilitation of post-cast edema of wrist fractures.It is planned to&#xD;
      investigate the positive effects of kinesio tape in edema control and rehabilitation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of distal radius fracture is increasing day by day. Circular cast is applied&#xD;
      in 70-80% of patients treated for distal radius fractures.During the rehabilitation of&#xD;
      patients after plaster application, joint stiffness, swelling on the hand and wrist, and&#xD;
      edema are frequently encountered.Edema in the hand and wrist negatively affects the daily&#xD;
      activities of patients, their quality of life, wrist and finger functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Edema is the main problem in rehabilitation after upper extremity injuries.It is known that&#xD;
      fibrosis and adhesions in soft tissues develop as a result of prolonged extremity edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elevation, massage, cold application, pressure gloves are used for edema control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinesio tape is used successfully in the control of edema related to the extremity,&#xD;
      especially in the control of lymphedema that develops after surgery.Kinesiotape is a&#xD;
      non-allergic elastic tape applied to the skin surface. Kinesio Tape working mechanism opens&#xD;
      the distance between the skin and subcutaneous tissues after it is applied to the skin and&#xD;
      increases lymphatic drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinesio tape also has the effect of supporting the joint and soft tissues around the joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research on kinesio tape has generally focused on the control of lymphedema that develops&#xD;
      after breast cancer surgery or stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are publications showing that kinesio tape applications are beneficial for edema&#xD;
      control after interventional procedures such as anterior cruciate ligament surgery and knee&#xD;
      prosthesis related to orthopedic surgical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the studies conducted for edema control in patients treated for distal radius&#xD;
      fractures, the effect of massage applications on edema has been investigated and it has been&#xD;
      shown that massage has positive effects on edema control and wrist functions(9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another study, the effectiveness of modified massage methods in the treatment of edema was&#xD;
      investigated and its positive effects were observed. There is no publication on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of kinesio tape application in the control and rehabilitation of post-cast&#xD;
      edema of wrist fractures. It is planned to investigate the positive effects of kinesio tape&#xD;
      in edema control and rehabilitation.&#xD;
