  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study. Investigators want to understand post-operative&#xD;
      recovery for patients undergoing mastectomy at NorthShore University HealthSystem. Some of&#xD;
      these patients receive PECS blocks with Liposomal Bupivacaine and some do not receive a&#xD;
      block. Investigators want to know whether patients who receive a block have better post&#xD;
      operative recovery and pain control than patients who do not receive one. Investigators also&#xD;
      want to understand whether PECS blocks with Liposomal Bupivacaine improves quality of&#xD;
      recovery at 72 hours post operatively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators plan to approach and consent 800 patients undergoing mastectomy, 400 with PECS&#xD;
      blocks and 400 without. Investigators will assess their quality of recovery using the QoR 15&#xD;
      survey at 72 hours post operatively. In addition, investigators will also record VAS scores&#xD;
      immediately postoperatively and at 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively. The study team will&#xD;
      also calculate the total morphine equivalents (MMEs) required for each patient after 72&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;

    <description>The patients in this cohort will undergo a PECS block with Liposomal Bupivacaine before their mastectomy. Patients will receive Liposomal Bupivacaine in combination with 0.25% Bupivacaine in a 1:1 mixture for the purpose of post-operative pain control.</description>
