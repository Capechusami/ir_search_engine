      The purpose of this study was to make sure whether the infiltration of dexmedetomidine around&#xD;
      the uterus can reduce the pain of cesarean section surgery.Studies have shown that the use of&#xD;
      local anesthetic infiltration around the uterus can reduce pain after cesarean section&#xD;
      surgery.In observed group, 50ug of dexmedetomidine (volume 10ml) was infiltrated around the&#xD;
      uterus at the end of the caesarean section, while in controled group, 10ml normal saline as&#xD;
      placebo was infiltrated around the uterus. VASs was accessed in 2h 12h,24h,48h after surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cesarean section is one of the most common inpatient surgical procedures in the world, and in&#xD;
      China, with the implementation of the comprehensive two-child policy, the number of elderly&#xD;
      mothers and patients undergoing another cesarean section has gradually increased, and the&#xD;
      cesarean section rate has also gradually increased; however, despite the many measures taken&#xD;
      to control post-cesarean pain, there are still many people with inadequate pain control. Pain&#xD;
      after cesarean delivery can have a significant negative impact on both the physical and&#xD;
      psychological aspects of the mother and lead to complications such as thromboembolism,&#xD;
      chronic pain and depression. Currently, a variety of methods are available to relieve&#xD;
      post-cesarean pain, such as patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA), patient&#xD;
      controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA), transversus abdominis plane block (TAPB), etc. However,&#xD;
      these analgesic methods are not perfect, and each has its own shortcomings. The currently&#xD;
      prevalent ERAS concept focuses on multimodal analgesia and minimizing the use of opioids to&#xD;
      reduce perioperative stress and reduce opioid nociceptive allergy. Compared to the technical&#xD;
      difficulties, risks and other potential complications, abdominal medication has some&#xD;
      advantages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraperitoneal spray of local anesthetic (IPLA) has become a commonly used method of&#xD;
      analgesia after laparotomy. Intraperitoneal administration is simple, safe, and can relieve&#xD;
      postoperative pain, shorten the length of hospital stay, and improve comfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One study showed that the use of intraperitoneal infusion of lidocaine (400 mg) improved pain&#xD;
      management in the early postoperative period after cesarean section and reduced the number of&#xD;
      patients requiring systemic opioids in the immediate postpartum period. It has also been&#xD;
      demonstrated that in patients undergoing bariatric surgery, intraoperative intraperitoneal&#xD;
      spraying of ropivacaine resulted in effective postoperative pain relief, less need for&#xD;
      morphine postoperatively, earlier activity and feeding, and shorter hospital stays, that&#xD;
      effective pain control encouraged early bedtime, reduced the risk of thrombosis, and reduced&#xD;
      pulmonary complications such as atelectasis or pneumonia, and that 24-hour postoperative&#xD;
      blood counts showed significantly lower leukocyte counts were significantly lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is a potent, multifunctional, highly selective α2-adrenergic agonist. It has&#xD;
      been shown in the literature that the application of dexmedetomidine can effectively reduce&#xD;
      the perioperative stress response, significantly reduce the dosage of opioids in the&#xD;
      perioperative period and prevent the transformation of acute postoperative pain into chronic&#xD;
      pain. Some animal experiments have shown that dexmedetomidine alone has obvious analgesic&#xD;
      effect when sprayed intraperitoneally with 12.5μg/kg of dexmedetomidine, the peak time is&#xD;
      20-30 minutes after administration, and the duration of action is 90 minutes. There are few&#xD;
      studies on the use of dexmedetomidine alone intraperitoneally to reduce postoperative pain in&#xD;
      the clinical setting and there is a lack of data to support its use in post-caesarean pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of intraperitoneal dexmedetomidine 50μg at&#xD;
      the end of cesarean delivery on maternal pain scores and satisfaction in the context of a&#xD;
      multimodal analgesic protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that intraperitoneal dexmedetomidine would reduce VAS pain&#xD;
      scores, reduce the number of patient-administered intravenous analgesic pump uses and&#xD;
      opioid-related side effects, and increase maternal satisfaction after cesarean delivery.&#xD;
