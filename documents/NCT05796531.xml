    <textblock>
      Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death among adolescents, with the highest risk period for&#xD;
      suicide being the month following psychiatric inpatient hospitalization. The investigators&#xD;
      propose testing a brief, scalable intervention using evaluative conditioning aimed at&#xD;
      reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviors among adolescents during and after inpatient&#xD;
      hospitalization. Scalable interventions, such as the one proposed that reduce suicide risk&#xD;
      during this markedly high-risk period, could result in large-scale decreases in suicide&#xD;
      death.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project has two phases: a pilot phase and randomized controlled trial phase. The study&#xD;
      within each phase consists of three parts: an inpatient study period, where baseline data are&#xD;
      collected, the intervention is initiated, and treatment targets and outcomes are assessed; a&#xD;
      one-month post-discharge period, where the intervention is continued and treatment targets&#xD;
      and outcomes are assessed and a one-month post-intervention period, where the intervention is&#xD;
      no longer administered but treatment targets and outcomes are assessed to test whether the&#xD;
      intervention has sustained treatment effects. For the inpatient period, the intervention and&#xD;
      the assessment of the treatment targets and outcomes will each be delivered via an iPad&#xD;
      administered by a research assistant (RA). During the post-discharge and post-intervention&#xD;
      periods assessments will be administered via smartphone mobile apps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Inpatient period. There are eight components to the inpatient part of the study: (1)&#xD;
      Parent informed consent and permission. As close as possible to the patient's intake, parents&#xD;
      will provide consent and permission for their child to participate. For patients over the age&#xD;
      of 17, the patient will be able to provide consent for themselves. For all participants, the&#xD;
      investigators will obtain parent consent to collect the qualitative data from the parent on&#xD;
      their child's experience of the intervention. (2) Patient assent and baseline data&#xD;
      collection. As part of standard clinical intake on the McLean-Franciscan inpatient unit,&#xD;
      participants will complete a self-report version of the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors&#xD;
      Interview (SITBI), which will be integrated into the study data set. As soon as possible&#xD;
      following parental consent, study staff will meet with participant to obtain assent and&#xD;
      collect baseline data. Patient baseline data collection will consist of administration of&#xD;
      study measures, including explicit and implicit measures of aversion toward SITB-related and&#xD;
      self-related stimuli (i.e., baseline assessments of the treatment target), SITB since&#xD;
      admission will be assessed (assuming it is more than 1 day after completing the full SITBI)&#xD;
      using a &quot;since last assessment&quot; version of the SITBI, and a brief interview to gather&#xD;
      information that can will be used to personalize the TEC intervention, such as details&#xD;
      regarding methods the patient has thought of or used to self-injure. Researchers will also&#xD;
      schedule a time for patients to complete TEC each day of their inpatient stay. (3)&#xD;
      Personalize TEC. Following, the interview, for participants' in the active TEC arm,&#xD;
      researchers will setup TEC to be personalized for each participant. For example, the&#xD;
      investigators will enter the participants' name in the positive-self TEC intervention based&#xD;
      on studies showing that evaluative conditioning paradigms where first names are paired with&#xD;
      positive stimuli have been shown to improve implicit affect to self-related stimuli. (4)&#xD;
      Installation of apps on patient's phone for the post-discharge part of the study. Parents&#xD;
      bring the patient's smartphone to the hospital. The investigators have developed procedures&#xD;
      to facilitate receiving and returning patients' phones, such as texting parents reminders and&#xD;
      having lockboxes available for phone drop-off and pickup. An app will be installed on&#xD;
      participants' phone. (5) TEC intervention and pre/post ratings relevant to acceptability.&#xD;
      Because electronic devices, such as phones or tablets, are not allowed on the inpatient unit,&#xD;
      each day a RA will bring an iPad to the patient to complete (a) the TEC intervention and (b)&#xD;
      pre-/post-intervention measurements of mood, desire to die and urge to kill oneself to help&#xD;
      evaluate the acceptability of TEC. (6) Assessment of treatment target and burdensomeness of&#xD;
      the intervention. Every three days on the inpatient unit, participants will also complete&#xD;
      measures of explicit and implicit aversion to SITB- and self-related stimuli, which are the&#xD;
      treatment targets and ratings of the burdensomeness of TEC to evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
      TEC. (7) Assessment of the outcome. Daily, prior to completing the TEC intervention,&#xD;
      participants will complete a questionnaire regarding the occurrence of any SITB in the prior&#xD;
      24 hours. SITBs are assessed frequently for the purposes of accurate measurement, such that&#xD;
      participants do not have to be remember SITB events over a few days. Daily sessions will take&#xD;
      less than 10 minutes. (8) Qualitative interview of intervention experiences. Every three&#xD;
      days, a brief interview will assess participants' experiences and reactions to the&#xD;
      intervention and qualitatively assess their mood and suicidal thoughts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Post-discharge intervention period. For 28 days after discharge, participants will receive&#xD;
      daily push notifications to complete a brief survey regarding SITB in the past 24 hours, the&#xD;
      TEC intervention, and pre-/post-intervention mood, desire to die and urge to kill oneself.&#xD;
      The push notification will be sent in the morning; additional reminders will be sent&#xD;
      throughout the day until the tasks are completed with a maximum of 5 reminders. Once every&#xD;
      two weeks, participants will also be asked to complete (1) implicit cognition measures to&#xD;
      assess the treatment target and (2) a brief measure regarding the burdensomeness of TEC. A RA&#xD;
      will contact the participant after two consecutive days of non-compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Post-intervention follow-up. Two- and four-weeks after TEC has ended, the investigators&#xD;
      will assess implicit cognitions (i.e., the treatment target) and SITB to test whether&#xD;
      treatment effects persist without the intervention. The investigators will send reminders and&#xD;
      contact participants if they do not complete the assessments.&#xD;

    <description>Participants are told which pictures are &quot;matched pairs.&quot; They find the &quot;matched pairs&quot; among 4 or 8 pictures. By associating pictures and words associated with SITB (e.g., pictures of cut skin, pictures of people engaging in potentially suicidal behaviors, and the word &quot;death&quot;) with naturally aversive images (e.g., snakes and spiders), it increases the aversion to SITB. The second goal is to increase liking toward the self by pairing self-relevant stimuli (e.g., the participant's name or other self-relevant details, as well as words like &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot;).</description>
