      Phase 1/2 trial to study the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of BN301 given&#xD;
      intravenously every 3 weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1/2 clinical study to evaluate BN301 administered&#xD;
      intravenously in patients with B-cell NHL who have previously failed standard therapy or who&#xD;
      are intolerant to standard therapy. This study includes two parts: a Phase 1 dose escalation&#xD;
      part and a Phase 2 dose expansion part. In Phase 1 and Phase 2, BN301 will be administered&#xD;
      intravenously on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle until disease progression, intolerable toxicity,&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, death, or other conditions in which patients are&#xD;
      not suitable for study treatment, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests will be performed weekly in Cycles 1-4 and every 3 weeks from Cycle 5&#xD;
      onwards (see Study Flow Chart). PK sample analysis will be performed on Days 1, 2, and 8 of&#xD;
      the first two treatment cycles, Day 1 of the third treatment cycle, and at specified time&#xD;
      points at the end of treatment (see Attachment 1). Additional clinical assessments and&#xD;
      laboratory tests may be performed at discretion of the investigator as clinically indicated.&#xD;

             is not suitable for the study drug, or will affect the interpretation of the study&#xD;
             results, or place the patient at high risk (e.g., the suitability of patients for&#xD;
             inclusion in the study will be determined by the investigator if they have recovered&#xD;
             from COVID-19)；&#xD;
