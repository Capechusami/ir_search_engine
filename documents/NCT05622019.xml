    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational study is to investigate the association of stage-grade of&#xD;
      periodontitis with sleep quality and fatigue and the effect of periodontitis on QoL (Quality&#xD;
      of life) in individuals with periodontitis and gingivally healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Have poor sleep quality, inadequate sleep and fatigue got an effect on periodontal&#xD;
           status?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Has periodontal status got an effect on sleep quality and fatigue?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the effect of periodontal status on quality of life?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine clinical and radiographic periodontal examinations of the participants were&#xD;
      performed. Groups were designed according to periodontal status and periodontitis-stages of&#xD;
      participants. Group 1- Healthy; Group 2- Stage I periodontitis; Group 3- Stage II&#xD;
      periodontitis; Group 4- Stage III periodontitis; Group 5- Stage IV periodontitis. The&#xD;
      participants were only asked to fill out the questionnaires (socio-demographic survey, tooth&#xD;
      cleaning habit survey, The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index(PSQI), The Jenkins Sleep&#xD;
      Scale(JSS), Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue scale (MAF) and Oral Health Impact&#xD;
      Profile-14 (OHIP-14)) included in the study and were informed about them. Then, if necessary,&#xD;
      the participants' routine periodontal treatments were performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with the findings of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Sleep quality was found higher in gingival healthy individuals. 3. The severity of&#xD;
      periodontitis increases, the sleep duration becomes shorter, 4. It has been observed that the&#xD;
      sleep quality in terms of gender is lower in female individuals compared to male individuals.&#xD;

      This was a prospective survey study reporting on a convenience sample of 124 healthy subjects&#xD;
      or patients with periodontitis reporting for care at the Periodontology Clinic, Necmettin&#xD;
      Erbakan University. This study was approved by the Faculty of Dentistry Non-Pharmaceutical&#xD;
      and Non-Medical Device Research Ethics Committee of Necmettin Erbakan University and was&#xD;
      conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2013. The study&#xD;
      participants provided a written informed consent and comprehended the assessment details&#xD;
      fully. The investigators excluded the participants who did not comprehend the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study, the number of patients required for each group was determined by&#xD;
      calculating the power (G * Power 3.1 software; Heinrich Heine University, DÃ¼sseldorf,&#xD;
      Germany). According to the power analysis results for one-way ANOVA test, the study performed&#xD;
      on 5 groups provides 90% power and 0.37 effect size for a total of 115 samples. However,&#xD;
      considering that there may be patients who could not continue the study, it was decided to&#xD;
      include 124 people in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measurements and stage diagnosis for all cases were performed by a single trained&#xD;
      and calibrated investigator (KD) using Williams periodontal probes. Calibration exercise was&#xD;
      performed in 10 non-study periodontitis patients. First, PD(probing pocket depth) and&#xD;
      AL(attachment loss) were measured and the same protocol was repeated 1 hour later.&#xD;
      Intra-examiner variabilities for PD and AL measurements were assessed after the completion of&#xD;
      all measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyzes were performed with the SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences) 26.0 package program. The normality of the distribution was checked with the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov Smirnov test. In the study, one-way anova test and Bonferroni test were used as&#xD;
      post hoc test for comparison according to stage, grade, age and educational status, while&#xD;
      independent sample t test was used for comparison according to gender. Pearson correlation&#xD;
      analysis was applied to test the relationship between the scales. Chi-square analysis was&#xD;
      used to evaluate the classification made according to sleep quality and the relationship&#xD;
      between stage and grade. Chi-square analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between&#xD;
      demographic characteristics and stage and grade. Statistical significance was assessed when p&#xD;
      &lt; 0.05.&#xD;

The results obtained by comparing the total OHIP-14 scores of the patients with the periodontal status of the patients constitute one of the primary results of this studyPatients answered their negative experiences on a 0 to 4 scale. The OHIP-14 score is the total score of the answers (0 to 56), with higher scores indicating poorer OHRQoL. Any score higher than the 14 was taken as an indication of poor OHRQoL</description>
