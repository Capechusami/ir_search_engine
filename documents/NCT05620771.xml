      The purpose of this research is to compare progression free survival between two available&#xD;
      systemic therapies - immunotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors - after Therasphere®&#xD;
      (yttrium-90) treatment in adult patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The&#xD;
      immunotherapy consists of a standard-of-care treatment with Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab.&#xD;
      Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors consists of standard-of-care Lenvatinib or&#xD;
      Cabozantinib.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare Progression Free Survival (PFS) in patients with advanced HCC who receive Y90&#xD;
      followed by immunotherapy (atezolizumab + bevacizumab, Arm A) or Y90 followed by TKI&#xD;
      treatment ( lenvatinib or cabozantinib, Arm B). For ARM B, [patients will receive Lenvatinib.&#xD;
      If they have prior history of treatment with Lenvatinib, then can be given Cabozantinib]..&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the Time to Progression (TTP) in patients with advanced HCC who receive&#xD;
      Immunotherapy combination compared to TKI following Y90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the Objective Response Rate (ORR) as assessed by RECIST v1.1 in patients with&#xD;
      advanced HCC who receive immunotherapy combination and those who receive TKI treatment after&#xD;
      Y90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare the Duration of Response (DOR) in patients with advanced HCC who receive&#xD;
      immunotherapy combination and those who receive TKI treatment after Y90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare the Clinical Benefit Rates (CBR) [CR, PR,SD] as assessed by RECIST v1.1 in&#xD;
      patients with advanced HCC who receive immunotherapy combination and those who receive TKI&#xD;
      treatment after Y90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To compare the Overall Survival (OS) in patients with advanced HCC who receive&#xD;
      immunotherapy combination and those who receive TKI treatment after Y90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To compare the safety and tolerability of patients with advanced HCC who receive&#xD;
      immunotherapy combination and those who receive TKI treatment after Y90, as defined by NCI&#xD;
      CTCAEv5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will first be treated one time with liver directed therapy, Therasphere® (Y-90),&#xD;
      following institutional procedures. After completion of Y- 90, patients will have some&#xD;
      recovery time (14-21 days) prior to starting systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for 2 years after completion of study treatment.&#xD;
