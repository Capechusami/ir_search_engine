  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia characterised by loss of muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance&#xD;
      burdens many older adults since the condition is related to functional decline. Periods of&#xD;
      inactivity such as during hospitalisation leads to further functional decline. It has been&#xD;
      reported that the loss of muscle mass associated with sarcopenia not only entails a decrease&#xD;
      in muscle mass but also changes in muscle architecture. Knowledge on changes in muscle&#xD;
      architecture is essential since it is one of the most important determinants on muscle&#xD;
      strength and thus physical performance. The main objective of this study is to investigate&#xD;
      changes in muscle architecture and physical performance during acute hospitalisation and&#xD;
      after discharge in older adults and subsequently the effectiveness of resistance training of&#xD;
      the lower limb during acute hospitalisation. If successful, our study could have a great&#xD;
      impact on the individual, as well as societal level, due to a better understanding of the&#xD;
      factors related to sarcopenia and the prevention of functional decline as a result of&#xD;
      hospitalisation.&#xD;
