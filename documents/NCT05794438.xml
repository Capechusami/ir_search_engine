  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to investigate whether a proposed algorithm&#xD;
      that adjusts the congruency ratio based on the user's performance and difficulty can enhance&#xD;
      the effectiveness of approach bias modification. Methamphetamine users will be recruited and&#xD;
      randomized into an algorithm group, a standard group, and a control group.&#xD;

    <description>In the standard approach bias modification, users were instructed to swipe upward when they see portrait format images and swipe downward when they see landscape format images. A shrinking animation comes after swiping upward to simulate the visual effect of moving away (approach), and a growing animation comes after swiping downward to simulate the visual effect of moving towards (avoidance). Two types of images, namely drug-related and non-drug-related, were used in the training. The drug-related images were related to methamphetamine (methamphetamine crystals, powders, and paraphernalia), and the non-drug-related images were related to healthy lifestyles (wealth, sports, gourmet, family activities, etc).</description>

An algorithm continuously monitors the performance of the user and adjusts the mix of congruent and incongruent trials accordingly.</description>
