  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to empirically test the theoretical mechanisms of relational perceptions in&#xD;
      the context of building and testing a relational artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot for&#xD;
      improving physical activity (PA) behaviors among a sedentary adult population in the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to build and experimentally test relational capacities of AI chatbot&#xD;
      in inducing positive human-AI relationship and leading to higher PA behavior change&#xD;
      intention. During the 7-day intervention, the relational chatbot will educate participants on&#xD;
      physical activity using 5 types of relational messages during a PA intervention including 1)&#xD;
      social dialogue, 2) empathy, 3) self-disclosure, 4) meta-relational communication, and 5)&#xD;
      humor. On the other hand, the non-relational chatbot will only deliver PA intervention&#xD;
      messages, without relational cues. Relational chatbot condition will be compared to the&#xD;
      non-relational chatbot condition to assess its effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to test the efficacy of the mobile app intervention leveraging&#xD;
      chatbots in increasing participants' relationship perception and physical activity behavior&#xD;
      change.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the recognition of the importance of communication for relationship and trust&#xD;
      building in healthcare programs (Ward, 2018), theoretical work and empirical testing of&#xD;
      relational capacities in AI chatbot designed for changing health behaviors is lacking in&#xD;
      previous research. In our systematic review of AI chatbot-based interventions on PA, diet,&#xD;
      and weight loss outcomes, it was found that although majority of studies programmed AI&#xD;
      chatbots to engage in relational communication behaviors (e.g., personalized greetings,&#xD;
      showing empathy and compassion), none of these studies tested whether AI chatbot's relational&#xD;
      capacities contributed to human-AI trust and relationship building (Oh et al., 2021). Beyond&#xD;
      knowing some chatbots were perceived to be useful and friendly, we do not know theoretical&#xD;
      mechanisms for what relational conversational strategies contribute to higher quality&#xD;
      relationship perception and behavior outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By developing an AI chatbot that provides access to informational, motivational, and&#xD;
      socio-emotional aspects of care will open new opportunities for delivering accessible&#xD;
      interventions to improve sedentary population's PA behaviors. More broadly, the test of the&#xD;
      AI Chatbot Behavior Change Model (Zhang et al., 2020) will provide the first empirical&#xD;
      evidence on the model's utility and working mechanisms accounting for how relational AI&#xD;
      chatbot can change health behaviors. If successful, the theoretical model and design of the&#xD;
      relational chatbot will be able to generalize to related behavior change fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This field experiment will randomly assign participants to relational chatbot condition or&#xD;
      non-relational (control) chatbot condition. Both conditions will involve an information&#xD;
      component addressing physical activity education sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to test the efficacy of the mobile app intervention leveraging&#xD;
      chatbots in increasing participants' relationship perception and physical activity behavior&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
