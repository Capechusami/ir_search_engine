  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical study is to assess the effects of different photobiomodulation&#xD;
      (PBM) conditions in men and women between 25 and 65 years old with daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness/drowsiness and /or mild mood complaints but be otherwise healthy. The main&#xD;
      question it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does PBM significantly affect health and well-being?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are PBM effects wavelength dependent?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Are PBM effects pulse dependent?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Are the eyes needed to assert an PBM effect or is exposure only to the skin sufficient?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What are the cellular, metabolic pathways underlying the systemic effects of PBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Exposed themselves 5 times per week during 2 weeks to the PBM stimuli between 9:30 and&#xD;
           12:30.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A week before the baseline measurement, participants will have to start wearing a Fitbit&#xD;
           Versa 3, and will have to continuously wear until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In the afternoon of the baseline day as well as in the afternoons after 5 and 10 PBM&#xD;
           sessions (week 1 and week 2, respectively), participants will have to go to the lab for&#xD;
           blood withdraw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In the evening of the baseline day as well as in the evenings after 5 and 10 PBM&#xD;
           sessions (week 1 and week 2, respectively), participants will have to collect saliva&#xD;
           samples as well as to complete questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be a double-blind placebo-controlled field study with a between subject comparison.&#xD;

    <description>In this study, the health benefits of the addition of NIR to the light spectrum of a desk lamp already available in the market will be investigate; Ikea Ypeperlig, to which a module with high power Lumileds NIR-Leds will be attached with beam angle of 90 degrees. They will be attached in such a way that, when the lamp is installed in the right place, a 1sr beam that covers the users face, neck and hands and lower arms on the desk with the required intensity of 5mW/cm2 of NIR at the skin surface.&#xD;
The device will be equipped with 3 sensors:&#xD;
A distance sensor connected to the driver of the NIR-leds, such that when the user leans forward or backward, the intensity of the NIR is automatically adjusted such that the intensity on the skin remains 5mW/cm2 (see figure below).&#xD;
a presence sensor&#xD;
ambient vertical lux sensor by which amount of light that enters the users' eye will be measured since it is known that these have an effect sleep, mood and performance.</description>
