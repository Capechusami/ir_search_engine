      The aim of the study is to evaluate the association between apical periodontitis (AP) and&#xD;
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by assessing the multiplicative effect of AP&#xD;
      on secondary outcomes of ASCVD. Sixty-two subjects will be enrolled from the Unit of&#xD;
      Endodontics and Restorative dentistry and allocated into 2 distinct groups depending on the&#xD;
      presence or absence of periapical lesions. Group 1 will be composed of 31 patients with&#xD;
      radiographic signs of AP. On the contrary, another 31 healthy individual (free from clinical&#xD;
      and radiographic evidence of AP) meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included&#xD;
      as controls (group 2) A complete dental examination will performed on each patient in both&#xD;
      groups. All the patients will be subjected to a cardiovascular examination to assess carotid&#xD;
      intima-media thickness (cIMT), presence of abdominal aortic aneurysm, presence of peripheral&#xD;
      pulses through echo-color-doppler.&#xD;

      The aim of the present case-control study is to evaluate the multiplicative effect of AP on&#xD;
      secondary outcomes of ASCVD. Sixty-two subjects will be enrolled from the Unit of Endodontics&#xD;
      and Restorative dentistry of the university of Siena.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria of the study are healthy patients older than 40 years old, the&#xD;
      presence of at least 24 teeth and the ability and willingness to give informed&#xD;
      consent.Participants affected by any systemic disease or being administered either&#xD;
      antibiotics in the last 6 months or antiaggregant, antiplatelet and antihypertensive&#xD;
      medications will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The atherosclerosis risk factors excluded in our study are prior or existing signs of CVD,&#xD;
      smoking habits, diabetes, obesity, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, and&#xD;
      echocardiographically detectable left ventricular hypertrophy. Patients with periodontal&#xD;
      disease and lesions other than endodontic etiology in maxilla/mandible are also excluded from&#xD;
      this study. Participants that were pregnant or lactating females, non-Italian, or only&#xD;
      English-speaking are also excluded from the study, as well as those who were unable or&#xD;
      unwilling to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty-two subjects fulfilling the previously described criteria will be enrolled from the&#xD;
      outpatient department and allocated into two distinct groups depending on the presence or&#xD;
      absence of periapical lesions. Group 1 will be composed of 31 patients with radiographic&#xD;
      signs of AP. On the contrary, another 31 healthy individuals (free from clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic evidence of AP) meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included as&#xD;
      controls (group 2) and matched on age, BMI, sex, and physical characteristics. AP cases will&#xD;
      be designated those patients with at least one tooth exhibiting radiographic evidence of&#xD;
      apical radiolucency exceedingly twice the width of the periodontal ligament space. A complete&#xD;
      dental examination will be performed on each patient in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform the initial screening, patients will undergo panoramic radiography and clinical&#xD;
      examination followed by periapical radiographs of the teeth suspected of AP using the long&#xD;
      cone paralleling technique with a film holder. The following parameters will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT index)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The number of teeth with AP&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Periapical Index Score All measurements will be recorded by one endodontist (GM). All&#xD;
           individuals will undergo cardiovascular examination in the Unit of Vascular Surgery,&#xD;
           University of Siena (Siena, Italy). The cardiovascular assessment included physical&#xD;
           examination, blood pressure measurement, past medical history, and echo-color-doppler&#xD;
           where carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), presence of abdominal aortic aneurysm,&#xD;
           presence of peripheral pulses through echo-color-doppler will b assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results expected from this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a significant increase in ASCVD secondary parameters (outcomes) in patients with PA&#xD;
           (exposure factor), compared with subjects without PA;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  significant association between BP and the presence of peripheral pulses and abdominal&#xD;
           aortic aneurysm, respectively.&#xD;

    <measure>Carotid Intima medial Thickness (c-IMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>C-IMT measurements are done in mm, and they are taken from the right and left common carotid artery (CCA) and they are used as surrogate endpoints to diagnose early signs of carotid atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence of Carotid Plaque</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>the presence of atherosclerotic plaques is considered as a surrogate endpoint point variable to diagnose early alterations of carotid atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Plaque is defined as a focal structure that encroaches into the arterial lumen of at least 0.5 mm or 50% of the surrounding IMT value or demonstrates a thickness &gt;1.5 mm as measured from the media-adventitia interface to the intima-lumen interface.</description>

    <measure>North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The NASCET method is used to calculate the percentage of stenosis in carotid arteries. The NASCET percentage is the ratio between the residual diameter at the stenosis and the surface of the distal normal lumen where there is no stenosis subtracted by the residual diameter at the stenosis.</description>
