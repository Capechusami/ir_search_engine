  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to define current care pathways for American Indian or Alaska&#xD;
      Native patients requiring specialty care and potential feasibility of conducting clinical&#xD;
      research within the existing framework. The study is designed with the flexibility to enroll&#xD;
      patients with any indication requiring referral to a specialist (neurologist,&#xD;
      ophthalmologist, or oncologist). Eligible patients will have recently (&lt;3 months) been&#xD;
      referred to a specialty care provider and not yet seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect data to determine whether a patient was seen by a specialist,&#xD;
      diagnosed with a specialized disease, patient characteristics potentially associated with&#xD;
      being seen or not seen by a specialist, and the reasons/barriers why a patient was not seen&#xD;
      by a specialist through a number of patient surveys.&#xD;

    <description>Participants who self-identify as American Indian or Alaska Native with any indication requiring referral to a specialist after a primary care provider standard of care visit will be observed to collect data, using several surveys at 6 and 12 months. No additional specialty care visits will be added for the purpose of this study given the intent to observe medical care received following primary care provider referral. Referral to a specialist will be based on local clinical practice.</description>
