      Investigation of the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of homologous and heterologous vaccine&#xD;
      combinations with regard to the formation of SARS-CoV-2 antispike antibodies in health care&#xD;
      workers after basic immunization and boost vaccination&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The basic immunizations (first and second vaccination) were performed from January to June&#xD;
      2021 using the m-RNA vaccine BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer, B)9 and the vector-based vaccine&#xD;
      ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca, A). BNT162b2 was used to boost vaccine all study population. The time&#xD;
      interval between the basic immunisation and the boost vaccination varied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four vaccine-groups could be distinguished:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 received BNT162b2 with the second vaccination 3 weeks after the first vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccinees of groups 2 and 3 received AZD1222/ChAdOx1-S as first vaccination and could choose&#xD;
      after 12 weeks whether second vaccination with BNT162b2 or AZD1222/ChAdOx1-S should be&#xD;
      carried out. This results in homologous (first: AZD1222/ChAdOx1-S, second: AZD1222/ChAdOx1-S)&#xD;
      and heterologous (first: AZD1222/ChAdOx1-S, second: BNT162b2) vaccine combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4 received BNT162b2 with the second vaccination 6 weeks after first vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected at six time points: four weeks, three and six months after&#xD;
      completion of the basic immunization, immediately before boost vaccination, four weeks and&#xD;
      three months after boost vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reactogenicity after first, second, and boost vaccination was assessed using questionnaires&#xD;
      to determine vaccine-induced adverse drug reactions (ADR) within seven days after the&#xD;
      respective vaccinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, demographic data (age, gender, occupational group, allergies) were collected,&#xD;
      local and systemic vaccination reactions are differentiated and the need for medication and&#xD;
      inability to work as a result of vaccination reactions are prospectively recorded.&#xD;
