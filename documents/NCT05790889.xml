      This is a Phase IIb randomised controlled trial of the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of&#xD;
      the blood-stage malaria vaccine candidates RH5.1 in Matrix-MTM and RH5.2-VLP in Matrix-MTM in&#xD;
      infants aged 5-17 months in Burkina Faso&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the initial recruitment to Groups 1 and 2, participants will be randomised 1:2 to&#xD;
      receive vaccination with the rabies control vaccination or RH5.1/Matrix-M.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During recruitment to Groups 3, 4 and 5, participants will be randomised 1:2:2 to receive&#xD;
      vaccination with rabies control vaccination, RH5.1/Matrix-M or RH5.2-VLP/Matrix-M Efficacy of&#xD;
      vaccination will be assessed by comparing the incidence of malaria cases in the pooled&#xD;
      control groups (Groups 1 and 3) to the incidence of malaria in each investigational vaccine&#xD;
      group (Groups 2,4 and 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three study vaccines: the IMP, 10μg RH5.1 adjuvanted with Matrix-M; 5μg RH5.2-VLP&#xD;
      and Rabies Vaccine. Participants will receive the first vaccination of RH5.1 10μg with 50μg&#xD;
      Matrix-M (Groups 2 and 4) or RH5.2 5μg with 50μg Matrix-M (Group 5). After approximately 4&#xD;
      weeks, a second dose will be administered, followed by a third and final vaccination&#xD;
      approximately 4 weeks later (Groups 3-5) or approximately 4 months later (Groups 1-2). Second&#xD;
      and third vaccinations will be administered at the same dose of both vaccine and adjuvant as&#xD;
      at the initial vaccination and will be given within the window period of 5 months. Volunteers&#xD;
      will be followed for 12 months from final vaccination.&#xD;
