  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational, non-therapeutic study for patients with T3, T4, or node&#xD;
      positive rectal cancer eligible to undergo total neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves the collection of data and biospecimens (blood and tissue) to&#xD;
      see if the presence of circulating tumor DNA (genetic material) ctDNA will help monitor&#xD;
      rectal cancer more closely and potentially detect a recurrence before routine scans,&#xD;
      performed per standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
      C2i Genomics, a biotechnology company, and the Spier Foundation are supporting this research&#xD;
      study by providing funding for the study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and the collection of data&#xD;
      and biospecimens. Non-operative management is offered as part of routine clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that up to 60 participants will be enrolled, with the goal that 55&#xD;
      participants will take part in this research study .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled on the study will remain on study for up to 60 months.&#xD;
