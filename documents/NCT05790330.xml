      'Mind and Skin': A prospective cohort study evaluating the impact of inflammation, itch and&#xD;
      sleep disturbance on the brain, mental health and cognition, in patients with severe atopy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic eczema is an intensely itchy skin disease which often starts in infancy or early&#xD;
      childhood. It can have profound effects on patients' quality of life and cause long-lasting&#xD;
      psychological impairment. Sleep may be very disturbed. More severe disease often requires&#xD;
      oral/injectable immuno-modulatory treatments (i.e. medications which control symptoms by&#xD;
      influencing the immune system).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an association between eczema, impaired cognitive functioning and mental health&#xD;
      disorders, but the underlying mechanisms are not clearly defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This projects examines the links between inflammation-driven itching and disturbed sleep, and&#xD;
      how this might be causally responsible for systemic and brain inflammation, disturbance of&#xD;
      cognitive functioning and mental health problems. The investigators will also study potential&#xD;
      changes occurring following an improvement in eczema when patients are treated with systemic&#xD;
      immuno-modulators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key investigations will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Home-based sleep studies using a commercially available sleep devices (for example DREEM&#xD;
      headband, Philips Actiwatch, oximetry) ii) Structural and functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) of the brain, iii) Blood tests to quantify systemic inflammation iv) Genetic&#xD;
      analyses, particularly related to the immune system, circadian rhythm (the &quot;internal 24-hour&#xD;
      clock&quot;), skin barrier function and the risk of developing eczema or associated diseases, v)&#xD;
      Assessments of the skin's barrier function vi) Stool samples and skin swabs to study the gut&#xD;
      and skin microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will utilise existing anonymised data for comparative purposes (e.g. from&#xD;
      patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and healthy controls who&#xD;
      previously had brain imaging.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will explore eczema patients' and families' perception of their disease, in&#xD;
      particular itch and the resulting sleep loss, through focus groups, to better understand the&#xD;
      sociological impact of eczema, and how these patients' interactions with the external world&#xD;
      and society are affected by eczema. Importantly, this will include exploration of family&#xD;
      dynamics, as patients with eczema often have profound sleep disturbance from early life,&#xD;
      which can impact on their caregivers' sleep and quality of life.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients aged 5 years or above with atopic eczema (groups 1 and 2), which has been&#xD;
             diagnosed by a Consultant Dermatologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with atopic eczema warranting systemic immuno-modulatory therapy or patients&#xD;
             with atopic eczema on topical therapy or healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Written informed consent for study participation obtained from the patient or from the&#xD;
             parent(s) / legal guardian, with assent as determined by the patient's age and level&#xD;
             of understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Willingness to comply with all study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Competent use of English language, according to patient's age (patients will be&#xD;
             required to understand the written questionnaires and complying with instructions&#xD;
             during MRI scanning).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Insufficient understanding of the study by the patient and/or parent/guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any clear contra-indication to MRI scanning. In particular this would be due to the&#xD;
             presence of any implanted devices or metal from previous surgery or accident. This&#xD;
             would be fully assessed with a standardised safety questionnaire by a radiographer&#xD;
             prior to MRI scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any condition deemed by the Investigator to limit a patient's ability to undertake MRI&#xD;
             components of the study, for example significant claustrophobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Diagnosed by a sleep medicine specialist with a formal sleep disorder, requiring&#xD;
             systemic medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Sleep disturbance from co-morbid illness (including physical and/or&#xD;
             mental/psychological illness) other than atopic eczema, deemed by the Investigator to&#xD;
             significantly impact on sleep components of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Previous and/or current substance misuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who take medications that would, in the investigator's opinion, impact on&#xD;
             quality of sleep studies.&#xD;
