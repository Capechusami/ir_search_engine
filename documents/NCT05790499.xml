  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Statin treatment significantly reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events. However,&#xD;
      cholesterol variability is associated with the risk of adverse events such as mortality,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, and stroke. The previous research found that the inflammatory activity&#xD;
      of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in mice fed with intermittent high-fat diet was&#xD;
      significantly increased, and the cholesterol variability had an impact on the trained&#xD;
      immunity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, thus aggravating the atherosclerosis in mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to compare the differences in serum LDL-C levels after intermittent atorvastatin&#xD;
      treatment and continuous atorvastatin treatment, and investigate the impact of this&#xD;
      difference on the trained immunity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.&#xD;
