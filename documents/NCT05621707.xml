    <time_frame>3 years after last patient enrolled</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the time between date of enrollment and first date of recurrence or death, whichever occurs first.Recurrence is defined as the appearance of one or more new lesions, which can be local, regional, or distant in location from the primary tumor site ( assessed by imaging or pathology). All deaths without prior recurrence are considered as PFS events.</description>

    <description>Two cycles of induction chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel, 200 mg/m2/day, day1; carboplatin, area under the curve of 5 mg/ml/min, day 1) combined with PD-1 inhibitors （Sintilimab, 200 mg/day, day 1）every 3 weeks followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Patients without progressive disease（PD） will proceed to receive immunotherapy (Sintilimab, 200 mg/day, every 3 weeks) as maintenance treatment for at least 1 year.</description>
