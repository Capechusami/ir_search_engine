    <textblock>
      Intraoperative hypotension is closely related to the poor prognosis of surgery. Hypotension&#xD;
      decreased blood flow perfusion of organs, which lead to dysfunction of multiple organs,&#xD;
      especially increasing serious complications such as cardio-cerebrovascular events and acute&#xD;
      renal injury within 30 days after surgery. The aim of this study is to establish a set of&#xD;
      strategies that can effectively prevent and treat intraoperative hypotension, so as to&#xD;
      alleviate possible harm to patients from perioperative hypotension. The study is focused on&#xD;
      the effectiveness of maintaining normal peripheral perfusion index (PPI) on time-weighted&#xD;
      average of hypotension during anesthesia. The lower target mean arterial pressure (MAP) was&#xD;
      higher than 65 mmHg. MAP less than 65 mmHg was defined as intraoperative hypotension between&#xD;
      induction and tracheal extubation.&#xD;
