  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urothelial carcinoma is the ninth most common malignant neoplasm worldwide. nearly in all&#xD;
      human tumors, actin filaments are involved in lamellopodia or cellular extensions. Cortactin&#xD;
      is involved in fixing the actin assembly to enhance cellular penetration. Assessment of&#xD;
      Cortactin expression in invasive and non-invasive urothelial carcinoma and recording any&#xD;
      significant different expressions may have benefits in developing more effective anticancer&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agents.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bladder carcinoma is the 9th most prevalent cancer worldwide. Mostcases are diagnosed in men.&#xD;
      Bladder carcinoma is categorized into three disticly different categories; non- muscle&#xD;
      invasive, muscle invasive and metastatic bladder carcinoma. Vast majority of all bladder&#xD;
      carcinomas are diagnosed as urothelial carcinoma (UC). Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC),&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma and other rare types represent the remaining 10%. In Egypt, bladder carcinoma&#xD;
      is ranked as the most prevalent cancer . The most important etiological causes for such&#xD;
      disease in Egypt are festation by S. haematopium and Cigarette smoking. Cortactin is a 63-65&#xD;
      kDa protein, encoded by a gene located on 11q13. Cortactin activates and binds to Arp2/3 and&#xD;
      stabilizes the branched Actin networks. Invadopodia are Actin-rich cellular protrusions,&#xD;
      associated with enhanced proteolytic activities in the invasive regions of carcinomas. it is&#xD;
      also incorporated in invadopodia, Cortactin expression is enhanced once or rapidly following&#xD;
      secretions of transmembrane metalloproteinase, MT1-MMP. Extracellular matrix (ECM)&#xD;
      proteolytic cleavage develops soon after secretion of MT1-MMP and Cortactin. increased&#xD;
      secretion of Cortactin was studied in a lot of malignant tumors, including melanoma, mammary,&#xD;
      pancreatic duct, hepatocellular and colorectal adenocarcinomas.&#xD;
