  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to investigate the safety and tolerability of BIIB091 monotherapy&#xD;
      in participants with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) (Part 1), and to evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of BIIB091 combination therapy with Diroximel Fumarate (DRF) compared with the DRF&#xD;
      monotherapy arm, on the key Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measure of active Central&#xD;
      Nervous System (CNS) inflammation (Part 2). The secondary objectives are to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of BIIB091 monotherapy on the MRI measures of active CNS inflammation, to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of BIIB091 combination therapy with DRF compared with the DRF monotherapy arm on&#xD;
      additional MRI measures of active CNS inflammation, to investigate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of BIIB091 combination therapy with DRF in participants with RMS.&#xD;

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product or auxiliary medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product or auxiliary medicinal product.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of RMS [relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) or active secondary&#xD;
             progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS)] in accordance with the 2017 Revised McDonald&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Time since MS symptom onset is &lt;20 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must have expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score of 0 through 5.0 at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Must have at least 1 of the following occurring prior to Baseline (Day 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ≥2 clinical relapses in the last 24 months (but not within 30 days prior to&#xD;
                  Baseline [Day 1]) with at least 1 relapse during the last 12 months prior to&#xD;
                  randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ≥1 clinical relapse within the past 24 months (but not within 30 days prior to&#xD;
                  Baseline [Day 1]) and ≥1 new brain MRI lesion (Gd positive and/or new or&#xD;
                  enlarging T2 hyperintense lesion) within the past 12 months prior to&#xD;
                  randomization. The screening MRI could be used to satisfy this criterion (if&#xD;
                  needed for inclusion, local read is required). For new or enlarging T2&#xD;
                  hyperintense lesions, the reference scan cannot be &gt;12 months prior to&#xD;
                  randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ≥1 GdE lesion on brain MRI within 6 months prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) in accordance with the 2017&#xD;
             Revised McDonald criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. An MS relapse that has occurred within 30 days prior to Baseline (Day 1) or the&#xD;
             participant has not stabilized from a previous relapse at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of severe allergic, anaphylactic reactions or hypersensitivity reaction to&#xD;
             BIIB091 or DRF, the excipients contained in the formulation, and if appropriate, any&#xD;
             diagnostic agents to be administered during the study, including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known hypersensitivity to any components of the study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known hypersensitivity to previous fumarate or bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK)&#xD;
                  inhibitor treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of hypersensitivity to parenteral administration of Gd-based contrast&#xD;
                  agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection&#xD;
             within the past 4 weeks prior to Baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History or positive test result at screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Current or history of hepatitis C infection regardless of viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Current or possible hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Current enrollment or plan to enroll in any other drug, biological, device, clinical&#xD;
             study, or treatment with an investigational drug or approved therapy for&#xD;
             investigational use within 90 days prior to randomization or 5 half-lives of the drug&#xD;
             or therapy, whichever is longer.&#xD;
