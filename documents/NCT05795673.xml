  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with cystic fibrosis, a deterioration in lung function around age 18, the age of&#xD;
      transfer from pediatrics to adult care services, has been observed. Transfer is only one step&#xD;
      in a transition process from pediatric to adult care taking place from age 12 to 24.&#xD;
      Adolescence is a period of identity construction during which the disease alters self-image&#xD;
      and self-esteem, and a period of empowerment in the management of the disease involving a&#xD;
      re-appropriation of it. During this period, coping strategies and psychosocial skills are&#xD;
      important to face all the issues that the adolescent encounters. Interventions for youth with&#xD;
      chronic illnesses rarely incorporate this dimension. Peer support or peer-mentoring is one&#xD;
      avenue for developing these coping skills. Peer support encompasses mutual support between&#xD;
      people who are coping or have coped with similar challenging life experiences. Individuals&#xD;
      with similar experiences would represent more credible role models to stimulate positive&#xD;
      change in their peers. The function of peer support are to provide emotional, experiential,&#xD;
      informational support.The effect of peer support improves social integration, coping skills,&#xD;
      sense of self-efficacy of the peers being helped. Promotion of healthy youth behaviors by&#xD;
      youth is the most widely evaluated youth engagement strategy in the community health sector.&#xD;
      Peer-assisted devices have been tested to improve medication adherence and health status with&#xD;
      youth with juvenile arthritis, asthma, and liver transplant recipients. By sharing their&#xD;
      experience of a successful transition, young adults with cystic fibrosis may be able to help&#xD;
      their adolescent peers better understand this transition. Our hypothesis is that implementing&#xD;
      peer support with adolescents with cystic fibrosis improves their sense of self-efficacy, a&#xD;
      dimension of coping skills.To our knowledge, there are no research studies on peer support in&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis in France or abroad. Patients are recognized as partners capable of sharing&#xD;
      their experiential knowledge with patients with a similar disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But this raises questions about the recruitment, supervision, preparation for peer-help and&#xD;
      the role of these patients; about the effects of their involvement for themselves&#xD;
      (valorization, anxiety) and for their peers (re-assurance, feeling of personal&#xD;
      effectiveness). This justifies conducting an exploratory study to assess the feasibility of a&#xD;
      peer-support intervention for youth with cystic fibrosis.&#xD;

    <description>Change in Quality of life of adolescents in transition, measured by the French version of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised (CFQ-R) at 6 months. The CFQ-R includes 34 cystic fibrosis-specific quality of life items, scored on a 4-modality scale, and exploring 9 dimensions including perceived health, burden of treatment, self-image (and body image in particular), emotional state, and social interaction that are particularly impacted by the transition period. The responses allow us to establish a score on a scale of 0 to 100, the higher the score the better the quality of life.</description>

    <description>Management and therapeutic adherence, measured by a cystic fibrosis-specific adherence self-assessment questionnaire and focusing on the patient's perceived adherence to the respiratory (physical therapy and therapeutics), digestive and nutritional components of cystic fibrosis management. This Cystic Fibrosis Compliance questionnaire will be used in its French version. Indeed, it has already been translated according to a standard translation-re translation procedure by the same research study in a previous study (NÂ° 2019-A01029-48, favorable opinion of the Ethic committee West IV - Nantes on 10/09/2019). This previous study is still in progress and will be published at the end of the study.</description>

    <description>Implementation and Evaluation:&#xD;
Intervention of mentor to provide peer support targeting psychosocial skills, coping and quality of life of adolescents with cystic fibrosis during the pediatric-adult transition The evaluation of the feasibility of the peer support program consists of assessing the effectiveness of its implementation in terms of its effect on the target audience, its acceptability to participants, and its implementation.&#xD;
The mentor and the mentee will be in contact once a month for a minimum of 3 months and a maximum of 6 months by telephone.&#xD;
The mentor will know the themes that the teenager would like to address in the context of peer support.&#xD;
The mentee will complete the various questionnaires provided in the protocol to answer the primary and secondary endpoints.</description>
