      A patient decision aid (PDA) was tested in a population of patients with superficial basal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma. This study evaluates whether the use of a PDA improved outcomes like&#xD;
      decisional conflict and knowledge.&#xD;

      Background Patients with a superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC) can choose between several&#xD;
      treatment options with specific advantages and disadvantages. A patient decision aid (PDA)&#xD;
      might facilitate a personalized decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives This study evaluates whether the use of a PDA results in a decreased level of&#xD;
      decisional conflict, improved satisfaction with the treatment decision, and increased&#xD;
      knowledge on prevention, recognition of BCC, and treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A prospective multicentre pre- and post-implementation study was performed amongst&#xD;
      patients with a newly diagnosed sBCC comparing a group that did not use the PDA (control&#xD;
      group) with a group that did (PDA group). The primary outcome was the level of decisional&#xD;
      conflict measured by the total mean score on the 'decisional conflict scale' (DCS) directly&#xD;
      before treatment. Higher scores correspond with higher levels of decisional conflict (scale&#xD;
      0-100). Knowledge of disease and treatment options was evaluated by using a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results Questionnaires were completed by 103 patients in the control group and 109 patients&#xD;
      in the PDA group. The mean total score on the DCS in the control group was 22.78 (SD 14.76)&#xD;
      compared to 22.34 (SD 14.54) in the PDA group. The adjusted mean difference was -0.39 (95% CI&#xD;
      -4.47-3.70, p=0.851). Cohen's effect size for the total score on the DCS was 0.03. Use of the&#xD;
      PDA resulted in a significant increase of knowledge on recognition of BCC (p&lt;0.001) and&#xD;
      treatment options for sBCC (p=0.005). According to exploratory subgroup analyses the&#xD;
      unadjusted mean difference in DCS score was higher in patients with sBCC in the head and neck&#xD;
      area (-4.53, p=0.378), patients without a history of BCC (-3.76, p=0.251), and patients with&#xD;
      higher educational level (-4.71, p=0.196).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion In the total study population with newly diagnosed sBCC, use of a PDA increased&#xD;
      knowledge on relevant issues, but had no significant effect on the level of decisional&#xD;
      conflict when compared with a control group. Exploratory subgroup analyses suggest that&#xD;
      specific subgroups of patients may benefit from the use of a PDA, but these results need to&#xD;
      be verified in larger studies.&#xD;

    <description>To evaluate patient knowledge, we used a questionnaire adapted by our research group from a knowledge assessment for melanoma. [14, 15] (Appendix B) The questionnaire included items on sun-protection (7 statements), risk factors for developing a BCC (10 statements), treatment options for sBCC (7 statements), and ways to recognize a BCC (6 statements). The proportions of patients with correct answers (true/false) for all statements within a domain were compared between the two groups.</description>
