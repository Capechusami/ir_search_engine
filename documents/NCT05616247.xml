  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current project uses a web-based program called the Expectancy Challenge Alcohol Literacy&#xD;
      Curriculum (ECALC) to reduce alcohol use and associated harms among college students.&#xD;
      Participants complete the interactive program in 50 minutes, and then provide daily,&#xD;
      real-time data on expectancies and alcohol use for 3 weeks after intervention, and again for&#xD;
      one week at 13 and 25 weeks after intervention. One group will also receive biweekly boosters&#xD;
      delivered via smart phone to assess their impact on intervention decay over time. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that ECALC effects may decay over time, and that biweekly boosters will prevent&#xD;
      this decay. Access to the ECALC is available on request from the principal investigator.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Expectancy Challenge Alcohol Literacy Curriculum (ECALC) is a 50-minute interactive&#xD;
      program, and the only non-experiential expectancy challenge that has been successful in&#xD;
      significantly reducing alcohol use and harms among college students. In studies focused on&#xD;
      mandated students, fraternity and sorority members, and first year college students, ECALC&#xD;
      has produced larger effect sizes than experiential expectancy challenge and all widely used&#xD;
      programs. ECALC outcome studies have thus far been limited to four weeks, but the design of&#xD;
      ECALC suggests that effects might be sustained for much longer. The primary aim of the&#xD;
      proposed project is to conduct an RCT designed to evaluate duration of ECALC effects over the&#xD;
      course of 6 months, and to assess the impact of smart phone-delivered boosters on maintenance&#xD;
      and enhancement of effects. Participants will be problematic drinking college students&#xD;
      recruited from first time in college new students. Students will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      ECALC only, ECALC plus boosters, or assessment only control. Ecological momentary assessment&#xD;
      (EMA) will be used to track alcohol use and expectancies for one week at baseline, three&#xD;
      weeks post-intervention, and one-week intervals at 3 and 6 months. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      students who complete ECALC will demonstrate immediate changes in alcohol expectancies, and&#xD;
      subsequently, this will drive lower alcohol use and lower rates of alcohol-related problems&#xD;
      (relative to the assessment only control students). It is also hypothesized that changes in&#xD;
      expectancies and reduction in alcohol use may decay over time among students who do not&#xD;
      receive boosters, while biweekly boosters will promote maintenance or enhancement of effects.&#xD;
      This study allows for the examination of (1) duration of ECALC effects up to 6 months, and&#xD;
      (2) the impact of biweekly boosters delivered via smart phones. In addition, use of EMA to&#xD;
      collect real time data on expectancies and alcohol use over the course of 6 months will allow&#xD;
      us to (3) map potential changes in expectancies in relation to alcohol use during this&#xD;
      critical period of transition. If successful, this project will validate the use of ECALC as&#xD;
      an efficient and effective program for reducing alcohol use and drinking-related harms.&#xD;

    <description>Expected effects of alcohol use measured with self-report survey. The survey is the 38 item Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol Scale (CEOA), a validated measure of alcohol expectancies. Participants complete the CEOA online on their mobile device and enter responses to each item. Scores range from 0 to 114 with higher scores indicating greater expectation of effects of consuming alcohol.</description>
