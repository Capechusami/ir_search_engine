  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As limited data is available locally and internationally regarding early Lumbar drain and its&#xD;
      effect on duration of CSF leak we have decided to compare it conservative treatment. By&#xD;
      providing CSF an alternative route for drainage, the fistula site will remain dry. Leakage&#xD;
      site won't be facing CSF pressure, and this will promote early healing of the wound.&#xD;

      Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)leak is caused by communication between the subarachnoid space and&#xD;
      the air-filled spaces of the middle ear or para nasal sinuses and sometimes skin. CSF leaks&#xD;
      can be divided into two types ,traumatic and non traumatic. The traumatic CSF leaks further&#xD;
      divided into accidental and iatrogenic (post surgical procedures) 1. Almost 80% of CSF leaks&#xD;
      are due to road traffic accidents, fall from heights and firearms injuries to brain and&#xD;
      spine, 16% are iatrogenic, and 4% are non-traumatic 1,2. More than 50% of traumatic CSF leaks&#xD;
      are evident within the first 02 days, 70% within the first week, and almost all present&#xD;
      within the first 3 months [2,3]. It is estimated that in patients with skull base fracture&#xD;
      10-30% develops CSF leaks and 2% of all traumatic head injuries are associated with CSF leaks&#xD;
      [4].With the help of conservative treatment most of the CSF leaks stop within 7-10 days 1,5.&#xD;
      When the CSF leak doesn't stop after 7-10 days, a lumbar drainage (LD) is suggested3,7.&#xD;
      LD(lumbar drain) is a recommended treatment method for the CSF leaks in skull base and spinal&#xD;
      trauma, the indications for LD(lumbar drain ) placement are still controversial ,LD(lumbar&#xD;
      drain) effect on early CSF leakage cessation is still arguable 2,3. Traumatic CSF leaks&#xD;
      duration can be reduced by early( lumbar drain) placement . At tertiary level particularly in&#xD;
      public hospital, our study will be helpful to document the benefits of early lumbar drain&#xD;
      (LD) in traumatic CSF leakage patients and their hospital stay. This will also help to reduce&#xD;
      the ambiguity regarding the protocol for early lumbar drain (LD) placement .&#xD;

    <description>Patient will be placed in the lateral decubitus position; catheter will be inserted by using a Tuohy needle in the interspinous area of lumbar spine. The LD catheter will reach the lumbar subarachnoid space.The remaining part of the drainage kit will be placed along the back of the patient. The catheter insertion site will be sutured and treated with povidone-iodine ointment. Sterile drape will be used to cover the entire external part of the LD.&#xD;
The CSF will be collected within the closed beg. CSF drainage through LD will be around 10 ml per hour or 200-250 ml/day.</description>
