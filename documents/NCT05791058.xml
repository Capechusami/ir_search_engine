  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, the Combined suprascapular nerve block and axillary nerve block (SSNB+ANB) was&#xD;
      proposed to provide anesthesia and postoperative analgesia for shoulder surgery as a safe&#xD;
      alternative to interscalene block. These two peripheral nerves are responsible for the&#xD;
      majority of the sensory innervation of the shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PENG block has been studied extensively in hip surgeries, but its place in shoulder surgeries&#xD;
      is not yet clear. It is a new technology reported for block of articular branches of the&#xD;
      shoulder and well pericapsular spread around the glenohumeral joint Therefore, achieving pain&#xD;
      relief while avoiding motor block allows us not only to provide an early rehabilitation&#xD;
      program in the postoperative period, but also to control the chronic nociceptive activation&#xD;
      secondary to pain-induced movement&#xD;

      Preoperative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine preoperative assessment will be done before operation to all patients including&#xD;
      history, clinical examination and laboratory investigations (complete blood picture, kidney&#xD;
      function tests, liver function tests, pro-thrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time).&#xD;
      Chest X-ray, electrocardiogram [ECG] will be done for patients above 40 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be informed about the study design and objectives as well as tools and&#xD;
      techniques. Informed consent will be signed by every patient prior to inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be informed about the analgesic regimen and will be instructed on how to&#xD;
      express pain intensity with use of the visual analogue scale (VAS) (10cm unmarked line in&#xD;
      which 0=no pain, 10cm=the worst imaginable pain)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic techniques:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General Anesthesia Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pre-medications will be given to every patient of the two including groups in the form&#xD;
           of midazolam (0.05 mg/kg, IV) together with omeprazole (40 mg, IV) and ondansetron (4&#xD;
           mg, IV) on arrival to the operative room after establishing a peripheral intravenous&#xD;
           access. Vital signs will be continuously monitored. After pre-oxygenation for 3 minutes,&#xD;
           general anesthesia is induced to all patients with fentanyl (1-2 Î¼g/kg, IV), propofol&#xD;
           (1-2mg/Kg, IV), and atracurium (0.5mg/Kg, IV) to facilitate endotracheal intubation.&#xD;
           Intermittent positive pressure ventilation of both lungs will be applied (to maintain O2&#xD;
           saturation &gt;98% and end tidal carbon dioxide measurement around 35-38 mmHg). Maintenance&#xD;
           of anesthesia will be achieved using intermittent positive pressure ventilation with&#xD;
           inhalation of 1-1.5% isoflurane in 50% O2 and atracurium (0.1mg/Kg, IV) every 30 minutes&#xD;
           to maintain muscle relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ultrasound guided PENG shoulder block Technique (Group A):&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient's arm is placed in external rotation and abducted at 45 degrees. A linear&#xD;
           ultrasound probe will be placed longitudinally between the coracoid and the humeral&#xD;
           head. After defining the humeral head, the tendon of the subscapular muscle and the&#xD;
           deltoid muscle over it, a 50-mm needle will be inserted using the ''in plane''&#xD;
           technique. When the needle pass through the deltoid muscle and touched the subscapularis&#xD;
           tendon, a bone-like hard tissue will be felt and the needle could not be advanced&#xD;
           further. The needle tip will be placed between the deltoid muscle and subscapularis&#xD;
           tendon, and 20 cc of 0.25% bupivacaine hydrochloride with 4mg dexamesathone will be&#xD;
           injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ultrasound guided combined suprascapular nerve block and axillary nerve block (SSNB+ANB)&#xD;
           Technique (Group B):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound guided suprascapular nerve block:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be positioned in a semi-recumbent position with the operating arm on the&#xD;
      contralateral shoulder. The probe will be kept over the scapular spine to identify the&#xD;
      trapezius and the supraspinatus muscle. Then, it will be moved laterally to identify the&#xD;
      concavity of the supraspinatus fossa and the hyper-echoic fascia of the supraspinatus muscle.&#xD;
      In the concavity of the fossa, the suprascapular artery and the suprascapular nerve run in&#xD;
      close proximity. 10 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine with 2mg dexamethasone will be injected below the&#xD;
      supraspinatus fascia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound guided axillary nerve block:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients is positioned in a semi-recumbent position with the arm slightly flexed and&#xD;
      adducted at the elbow. The posterior surface of the humerus will be visualised in the short&#xD;
      axis view. So, the AN and posterior circumflex artery will be visualised longitudinally. 10&#xD;
      ml of 0.25% bupivacaine with 2mg dexamethasone will be injected into space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blocks will be considered a failed block if the block is not successful 30 min after the&#xD;
      injection of the local anaesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A 20 Patients of this group will receive ultrasound guided pericapsular nerve group&#xD;
      shoulder block (PENG Block) at the end of surgery using 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine with 4mg&#xD;
      dexamethasone with a maximum dose of (3mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B 20 Patients of this group will receive single shot suprascapular and axillary nerve&#xD;
      using a single dose of 10ml of 0.25% bupivacaine with 2mg dexamethasone each at the end of&#xD;
      surgery for postoperative pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C 20 patients of this group will receive general anesthesia without nerve block. In the&#xD;
      post anesthesia care unit (PACU) for first hour and in ward afterwards , all patients will be&#xD;
      assessed for presence and severity of pain at at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours&#xD;
      postoperatively or at any time patient suffers from pain with visual analog score and&#xD;
      recording its value at any patient visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nalbuphine 0.1 mg/kg is the rescue analgesic that will be given to any patient who will&#xD;
      suffer pain with VAS more than 3.&#xD;
