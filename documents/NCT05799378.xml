  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) medication that has been&#xD;
      very effective in reducing lupus disease activity and keeping patients stable with reduced&#xD;
      symptoms. Despite a track record of safety with regard to infection compared to traditional&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agents, the risk of HCQ retinal toxicity escalates with continued use.&#xD;
      Evaluation using sensitive standard of care approaches suggests nearly a third of patients&#xD;
      accrue retinal damage. Data are needed to accurately weigh the balance between accumulating&#xD;
      ocular exposure of HCQ versus the risk of disease flare in a population that may have more&#xD;
      inactive disease than younger patients. The purpose of this trial is to address the safety of&#xD;
      withdrawal of HCQ in SLE patients =60 years old. The central hypothesis is that HCQ can be&#xD;
      safely discontinued in stable/quiescent patients assessed by validated disease activity and&#xD;
      flare instruments in the context of serologic, cytokine and transcriptomic profiling.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to either the placebo or active arm and followed every 2 months&#xD;
      for one year to assess disease activity and flares.&#xD;

    <description>The SF-36 is 36-item self-rated measure of quality of life. A scoring algorithm is used to convert the raw scores into a range from zero (the respondent has the worst possible health) to 100 where the respondent is in the best possible health.</description>

    <description>PROMIS-29 consists of 29 questions rated on a scale from 1-5. The raw score is converted to a final T-score metric with a mean T-score of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. The final score ranges from 0 (worst possible outcome) to 100 (best possible outcome). The questionnaire assesses seven domains - depression, anxiety, physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and ability to participate in social roles and activities.</description>

               -  Criterion 1: Clinical SLEDAI= 0&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Criterion 2: SELENA-SLEDAI PGA ≤ 0.5 (on a scale from 0-3, where 0 is no disease&#xD;
                  activity and 3 is maximum disease activity)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Criterion 3: Current prednisolone (or equivalent corticosteroid) dose ≤ 5 mg&#xD;
                  daily&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any patient that does not attain stable disease status by DORIS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ophthalmologic evidence of retinopathy (these patients would be advised to discontinue&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any reason the treating rheumatologist is concerned about ongoing activity not&#xD;
             captured by SLEDAI&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HCQ level &lt; 100 ng/ml as this would support noncompliance and less reliance on HCQ to&#xD;
             control activity&#xD;
&#xD;
