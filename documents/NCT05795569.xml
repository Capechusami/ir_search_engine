  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-extubation dysphagia (PED) is a frequent but still underestimated condition in the&#xD;
      intensive care units (ICU). In the international literature, the manifestations and&#xD;
      consequences of PED lead to intra- and post-intensive care comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact etiology of PED is unknown, but considered multifactorial. Numerous causes,&#xD;
      acquired during ICU, can lead to a delay in the reintroduction of intravenous nutrition, or&#xD;
      even favor the development of inhalation pneumopathy. One of these causes is the presence of&#xD;
      the nasogastric tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of ECD varies from 3 to 62%. Its presence impacts morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Preventive strategies for PED have only been studied with questionable methodologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of ICU therapists is to detect PED as early as possible in order to implement&#xD;
      curative strategies such as adapted nutrition and early swallowing rehabilitation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several tools available to diagnose PED. These assessment methods are numerous and&#xD;
      not subject to consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are expensive instrumental methods requiring experts, which allow for accurate&#xD;
      diagnosis but cannot be routinely used at the ICU patient's bed. For the ICU patient,&#xD;
      bed-side clinical assessments seem more appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Yale swallow protocol&quot; (YSP), is the most used test in the literature. Its sensitivity&#xD;
      in predicting PED at 96.5%, a negative predictive value of 97.9% and a false negative rate of&#xD;
      less than 2%, seem to make it the most suitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no recommendations have been made by French or international ICU societies on the&#xD;
      appropriate time or method for PED assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the treatment of PED, the literature shows that physiotherapy management would not&#xD;
      significantly reduce its incidence, nor accelerate the resumption of per os feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study has examined the impact of nasogastric tube removal combined with the use of a&#xD;
      standardized swallow test on post-extubation ECD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all these reasons, we plan to evaluate the interventional strategy consisting in removing&#xD;
      the nasogastric feeding tube as soon as extubation, to carry out between 1 hour and 6 hours&#xD;
      post extubation the &quot;Yale swallow protocol&quot;, to allow a resumption of feeding as soon as&#xD;
      possible while screening the dysphagic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypothesis is therefore:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Systematic removal of the nasogastric tube during the extubation procedure associated with&#xD;
      an early swallow test in the ICU allows an early per-os nutritional resumption in comparison&#xD;
      with the classical strategy of nasogastric tube management and swallowing disorders&#xD;
      assessment&quot;&#xD;
