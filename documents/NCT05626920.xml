  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aberrant retinoic acid signaling driven by the degenerating outer retina leads to&#xD;
      pathological changes to the inner retina. The resulting hyperactivity of retinal ganglion&#xD;
      cells leads to further diminution of the remaining vision in those afflicted with inherited&#xD;
      retinal diseases. Inhibition of this pathway has led to improved visual function in murine&#xD;
      models of retinal degeneration. This can be accomplished in humans with the FDA-approved&#xD;
      irreversible inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenases, disulfiram.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age ≥18 years Only those with a clinical diagnosis of inherited retinal degeneration. When&#xD;
        available, supporting genetic diagnosis form a CLIA approved lab will be further considered&#xD;
        for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only one eye per subject should be identified as the study eye. The study eye must meet the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Best corrected ETDRS visual acuity letter score ≥ 70 (i.e., 20/40 or better) within 30&#xD;
             days of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Goldmann visual field exhibiting constriction of visual fields to 10 degrees centrally&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to abstain from alcohol consumption for the duration of the study and&#xD;
             the 2 weeks preceding it and 2 weeks following the study end point&#xD;
&#xD;
        Liver function values that fall in the normal range as specified below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alanine transaminase (ALT): less than 40 IU/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate transaminase (AST): less than 40 IU/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Alkaline phosphatase (ALP): less than 300 IU/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Albumin (Alb): less than 50 g/L&#xD;

             be questioned about the potential for pregnancy. Investigator judgment will be used to&#xD;
             determine when a pregnancy test is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
