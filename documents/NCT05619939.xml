  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a central hub for human health given its essential role in&#xD;
      nutrient absorption, waste production and immunity. Diet is a major contributor to gut health&#xD;
      including affecting the incidence and severity of GI disease. This is mediated, at least in&#xD;
      part, by the presence of microbiota, a highly diet-dependent biome. In fact, dietary changes&#xD;
      are capable of altering bacterial populations and/or microbial metabolism, which in turn,&#xD;
      controls the type and abundance of small molecules being produced in the gut, many of which&#xD;
      can exert biological effects. Several lines of evidence suggest that dietary protein in&#xD;
      particular, can impact gut health. Therefore, this trial will test whether dietary protein&#xD;
      type differentially impacts gut function in humans by carrying out a single-blinded&#xD;
      randomized cross-over controlled feeding study in healthy individuals. Subjects will be&#xD;
      provided with an individualized very low protein diet augmented with pea- or egg&#xD;
      white-derived protein supplements, as their major protein source. The impact of consuming pea&#xD;
      vs. egg white protein on 1) the fecal metabolome, 2) gut barrier function and 3)&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms will be determined.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is designed as a single-blinded randomized crossover trial in which individuals will be assigned to 2 groups. One group will receive 10 days of pea protein isolate followed by 10 days of consuming egg white protein isolate, with the two treatment periods separated by a 14-day washout period. The second group will receive the isolates in the opposite order.</intervention_model_description>
