  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to evaluate peri-operative surgical characteristics, operation&#xD;
      extent, postoperative morbidity, and outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for advanced&#xD;
      thyroid cancer in different European centers using the EUROCRINE® database.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of thyroid cancer has risen exponentially over the last decades among developed&#xD;
      countries. Even though this is mainly attributed to small well differentiated carcinomas&#xD;
      (DTC) with excellent prognosis, the rates of advanced disease have also elevated. While the&#xD;
      characteristics of advanced thyroid cancer are intuitively recognized by experienced surgeons&#xD;
      of the field, a common definition among scientific societies is yet to be reached. The four&#xD;
      main features of advanced cancer are locally and regionally advanced disease, distant&#xD;
      metastasis, and recurrence. Guidelines for the optimal treatment of advanced disease are&#xD;
      mainly included in the broader guidelines of each cancer subtype, such as the American&#xD;
      Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines for DTC, Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC) and most&#xD;
      recently Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma (ATC). In the European setting, the European Society&#xD;
      for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2019 guidelines on thyroid cancer include a subsection for the&#xD;
      management of advanced disease of each thyroid cancer type. A common limitation among&#xD;
      published guidelines is the moderate to low level of evidence upon which the advanced disease&#xD;
      recommendations are based; however, broad consensus has been reached regarding the paramount&#xD;
      importance of surgery if an R0/R1 resection is achievable. Recently, new advances in targeted&#xD;
      therapy guided by genetic alterations found in the tumor have provided new treatment options&#xD;
      for patients; therefore, latest guidelines encourage the inclusion of patients with advanced&#xD;
      disease in these clinical trials. Finally, neoadjuvant therapy modalities are constantly&#xD;
      gaining ground with promising results allowing a greater portion of patients to benefit from&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
