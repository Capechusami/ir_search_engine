    <textblock>
      The overall aims of this study are to demonstrate that treatment with PVX108 immunotherapy&#xD;
      has an acceptable safety profile and is effective for reducing clinical reactivity to peanut&#xD;
      protein in children and adolescents with peanut allergy.&#xD;

             antibody per litre (kUA/L) at screening;&#xD;

          -  Able to perform spirometry or peak expiratory flow. Children who are 4 years of age at&#xD;
             Screening Stage 1 visit and unable to perform peak expiratory may be enrolled&#xD;
             providing they had no clinical features of moderate or severe persistent asthma within&#xD;
             1 year prior to the Screening visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥80% predicted in adolescents and children&#xD;
             with asthma capable of performing spirometry, or peak expiratory flow ≥80% predicted&#xD;
             in participants with asthma unable to perform spirometry (at investigator's&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Severe or unstable asthma as assessed by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA)&#xD;
             assessment of asthma control OR current treatment for asthma at GINA ≥Step 4 level;&#xD;

          -  Participants with skin disorders that would hinder skin prick testing and/or its&#xD;
             interpretation or study drug administration (eg, severe generalised poorly&#xD;
             controllable atopic dermatitis);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical condition in which epinephrine (adrenaline) is contraindicated;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy aimed at desensitising peanut allergy, either in a formal study or in&#xD;
             clinical practice;&#xD;
