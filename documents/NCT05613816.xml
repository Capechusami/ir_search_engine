      This is a prospective, single-center, observational clinical trial at the Department of&#xD;
      Women's Health of the University Hospital Tübingen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 patients affected by uterine diseases with indication for hysterectomy undergo treatment&#xD;
      with robotically assisted laparoscopic procedures using the Senhance Surgical System (See&#xD;
      Synopsis - Indication A) and are compared to a cohort of 200 patients treated with&#xD;
      conventional laparoscopic surgery from a similar ongoing study (Ethics vote: 621 /2018BO1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 patients affected by other uterine conditions / adnexal conditions that require&#xD;
      uterine/adnexal/tubal surgery (see Synopsis - Indication B) undergo treatment with&#xD;
      robotically assisted laparoscopic procedures using the Senhance Surgical System and are&#xD;
      compared to a cohort of 200 patients with indication for other uterine conditions / adnexal&#xD;
      conditions that require uterine/adnexal/tubal surgery (see Synopsis - Indication B) who&#xD;
      underwent conventional laparoscopic surgery at the Department of Women's Health in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of patient recruitment, surgical procedure times, estimated blood loss, intra- and&#xD;
      post-operative complications and the percentage of conversions from the robotic assisted&#xD;
      treatment/conventional laparoscopic surgery to multiple access and/or to a laparotomic (open)&#xD;
      approach will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will answer questionnaires (German version of the Short Form-36health survey&#xD;
      questionnaire (Medical Outcomes Trust), German version of the female sexual function index&#xD;
      (FSFI)) at baseline and at 3 and 6 months of follow-up. A questionnaire for patient&#xD;
      satisfaction will be answered one day post procedural, at discharge and at 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>The SF-36 questionnaire (Short Form 36 Health Survey) is a widely used measure of health status and quality of life. The questionnaire consists of 36 items that measure eight health domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. The scores range from 0 to 100 for each domain, with higher scores indicating better health status. Therefore, higher scores on the SF-36 indicate a better outcome.</description>
