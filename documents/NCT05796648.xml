  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension and obesity are both major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), a&#xD;
      leading cause of death for Black women in the United States. The investigators propose&#xD;
      examining the feasibility and acceptability of the 12-week RN-CHeFRx (Real Nourishment and&#xD;
      Cooking Healthy Food is Rx) intervention - grocery delivery, cooking classes, and nutrition&#xD;
      education - for Black women with hypertension and obesity to improve nutritious eating habits&#xD;
      and blood pressure control.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to conduct the RN-CHeFRx (Real Nourishment and Cooking Healthy&#xD;
      Food is Rx) for 12 weeks among Black women who are obese and hypertensive living Chicago. We&#xD;
      propose to 1) Pilot the RN-CHEFRx intervention and measures that will be used to assess blood&#xD;
      pressure, BMI status, and sodium intake with 20 Black women diagnosed with hypertension and&#xD;
      BMI ≥ 30. We will assess the efficacy of the evaluation tools to be used in a future clinical&#xD;
      trial at three-time points (baseline, 12 weeks, and 6 months); and 2) Assess the feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of the RN-CHeFRx intervention using interviews, surveys, and documentary&#xD;
      analysis. Findings from this study will inform a larger efficacy trial of RN-CHeFRx to&#xD;
      improve dietary behaviors and blood pressure control among Black women with hypertension and&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;
