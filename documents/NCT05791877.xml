      This proposal addresses pulmonary dysfunction in severe cerebral palsy by using a novel&#xD;
      non-invasive respiratory sensor. The two aims of the project are to 1) provide a screening&#xD;
      tool to detect respiratory distress and 2) Find a correlation between the degree of pulmonary&#xD;
      dysfunction and scoliosis in children with cerebral palsy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project proposes the utilization of a novel non-invasive real-time breathing sensor -&#xD;
      pneuRIP- to measure pulmonary function (PF) in children with high-level cerebral palsy.&#xD;
      Currently the standard measures of PF such as spirometry and peak flow meters are too&#xD;
      strenuous for children and those with severe CP, as a result they have low compliance rates.&#xD;
      The pneuRIP does not require active user participation and can passively measure PF. It&#xD;
      consists of two inductive bands worn around the chest and abdomen that measure and&#xD;
      differentiate diaphragmatic and chest breathing through Respiratory Inductance&#xD;
      Plethysmography (RIP). Readings are recorded and analyzed on a small chest-worn unit and&#xD;
      wirelessly transmitted to an iPad. The pneuRIP yields indices of work of breathing (WOB)&#xD;
      which includes the phase angle between the chest and abdomen; percentage breathing through&#xD;
      the ribcage; respiratory rate; and labored breathing index. This sensor takes little time to&#xD;
      set up and readings are provided instantaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WOB indices provide a screening tool for pulmonary diagnosis and treatment, decrease the&#xD;
      risk for pneumonia and respiratory illness, and has the potential to act as a marker for&#xD;
      scoliosis in children with high-level CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact on the field will be to have a simple and fast way to measure pulmonary function&#xD;
      in children and adults with severe CP and correlate this to measures of function and&#xD;
      scoliosis severity as the effects of scoliosis, which is common in CP, on pulmonary function&#xD;
      is unclear. Measures of motor function are classified by the Gross Motor Functional&#xD;
      Classification System (GMFCS), ranking from I to V, with worsening disability from near&#xD;
      normal gait in Type I to complete wheelchair use in Type V. This project will address GMFCS&#xD;
      levels IV and V which includes people using wheelchairs. The two specific aims are a) Measure&#xD;
      WOB indices non-invasively using the pneuRIP sensor in children with CP who use a wheelchair&#xD;
      (GMFCS level IV, V) and validate the use of WOB indices as a screening test for pulmonary&#xD;
      dysfunction., 2) Determine the correlation between WOB indices and the degree of scoliosis&#xD;
      using the pneuRIP sensor in 250 children with CP who use a wheelchair (GMFCS level IV, V).&#xD;
