      Acute leukemia (AL) is the most common cancer in children. Despite the optimization of&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatments and the development of supportive care, a certain number of AL's&#xD;
      relapse and/or progress to death of the child. It therefore seems essential to try to better&#xD;
      understand the physiopathology and the mechanisms of resistance to treatment of these&#xD;
      diseases. The study of the microenvironment appears in this context as a promising avenue.&#xD;
      The bone marrow microenvironment is composed of an extracellular matrix and cells, in&#xD;
      particular mesenchymal stromal stem cells (MSC's). In adult acute leukemia, it has been&#xD;
      clearly demonstrated that these microenvironment cells are reprogrammed by leukemia cells to&#xD;
      allow the development and proliferation of the latter. Links have also been demonstrated in&#xD;
      acute leukemia between the cells of the microenvironment and resistance to chemotherapy. In a&#xD;
      certain number of cases, the support of the microenvironment for the development of leukemia&#xD;
      or resistance to chemotherapy involves modulation of the energy metabolism of leukemia cells.&#xD;
      This notably involves interactions between leukemic cells and MSCs and re-programming of the&#xD;
      energy metabolism of the latter. To date, there are only very few studies concerning the role&#xD;
      of the microenvironment in acute childhood leukemia and none to date has specifically studied&#xD;
      the energy metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis) of MSCs.&#xD;
