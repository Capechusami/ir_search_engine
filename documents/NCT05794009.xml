  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR) based&#xD;
      rehabilitation protocol for improvement of blood glucose control and exercise compliance of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects aged 55-85 diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes will be recruited. A written consent will&#xD;
      be obtained from subjects. Subjects recruited will be randomly divided into one of the two&#xD;
      groups. The VR group will receive an exercise program conducted in elderly centre or a&#xD;
      control group will receive home exercise program. The 12-week exercise program will be&#xD;
      conducted three times per week and each session will last for one hour. Assessment that takes&#xD;
      about one hour to complete will be carried out at baseline, mid-way (6th week) and after the&#xD;
      12-week exercise training. Assessment items include physical, psychosocial and cognitive&#xD;
      function. Also, blood test on HbA1c will be carried out at baseline and at the end of the&#xD;
      12-week training. During this course of research, subjects are strongly advised to stay with&#xD;
      their present lifestyle and medication.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Recruited participants from community centers will be randomly allocated into either an IVRE program or a home-based exercise program that is identical to the intervention group (control group) using computer-generated random numbers. This will be a single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT), where outcome assessor(s) will be blinded to the allocation of participants throughout the study. Participants will be informed of their allocated exercise protocols, and they will be advised not to disclose their allocated intervention to the assessor(s) or other participants.</intervention_model_description>
