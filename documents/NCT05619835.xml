      The aim of the study is to analyze the applicability (usability) of a tele-health service as&#xD;
      part of a potential disease management program for patients with peripheral arterial disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following investigations will be conducted as part of the usability study. In the context&#xD;
      of a tele-health service, knowledge, physical condition (including walking distance) will be&#xD;
      documented during face-to-face and televisits, dislocated supervised gait training and&#xD;
      education will be provided, and satisfaction with the tele-health service will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disease management programs (DMPs) are one of the methods used to optimize the care of&#xD;
      patients with chronic diseases. DMPs are coordinated health care measures for patient&#xD;
      populations with diseases in which active patient participation in treatment can lead to&#xD;
      substantial effects. Specific treatment regimens, based on evidence-based treatment&#xD;
      guidelines and structured patient information, are predominantly aimed at preventing disease&#xD;
      exacerbations and complications. The World Health Organization (WHO) also recommends, among&#xD;
      other things, forcing patient adherence through structured information and patient&#xD;
      empowerment strategies to establish participatory treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) causes oxygen and nutrient deprivation of tissues through&#xD;
      narrowing of arterial vessels in the extremities. The cause of PAD is arteriosclerosis. The&#xD;
      course of the disease begins asymptomatically and manifests itself over time with pain and&#xD;
      cramps predominantly in the muscles of the lower extremity. The pain symptoms usually occur&#xD;
      initially during physical exertion, and later at rest. As PAD progresses, chronic ulceration&#xD;
      and necrosis occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Professional societies such as the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European&#xD;
      Society of Vascular Medicine (ESVM) regularly publish guidelines for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of PAD. Therapy of PAD consists of drug therapy for the purpose of cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk reduction (lipid and blood pressure lowering drugs and anticoagulant drugs as well as&#xD;
      therapy of diabetes mellitus). Another aspect in the event of disease progression is&#xD;
      interventional angioplasty, in which the affected constriction in the leg arteries is dilated&#xD;
      and, if necessary, treated with stents. Another important pillar is also structured and&#xD;
      supervised gait training and, in general, an improvement in lifestyle with cessation of&#xD;
      nicotine abuse and a healthy diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, structured gait training, which should be performed at least three times a&#xD;
      week for 30 to 60 minutes, is strongly recommended in the current ESVM and ESV guidelines.&#xD;
      Studies showed that structured gait training can increase walking distance by 200% in 12&#xD;
      weeks in patients with claudication. Daily individual interval training of 60 minutes with 5-&#xD;
      to 15-minute intervals also proved effective in increasing walking distance. This is to&#xD;
      overcome the pain threshold of claudication while walking. Furthermore, evidence showed that&#xD;
      gait training may be equivalent to endovascular interventions in terms of long-term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to analyze the applicability (usability) of a telehealth service as&#xD;
      part of a potential disease management program for patients with peripheral arterial disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective monocentric pilot study will be conducted at the clinical department of&#xD;
      angiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration per participant is 90 (Â±14) days and is divided into 2 observation phases.&#xD;
      In phase 1, there will be supervision by a certified nurse and the telehealth service app,&#xD;
      and in phase 2, there will be only singular use of the app without contact by the certified&#xD;
      nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Declaration of Helsinki (as amended from time to time) and the guidelines of &quot;Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice&quot; were taken into account in the conduct and also the planning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the framework guideline for the &quot;IT infrastructure in the application of&#xD;
      telemonitoring&quot; was used for the planning of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the manufacturer's manuals, the pedometers AS80/AS97/AS99 from the company&#xD;
      Beurer are not medical devices. The app serves as a diary for patients and is not a Clinical&#xD;
      Decision Support System. The &quot;User's Manual PAD Stepping&quot; is included with the study&#xD;
      material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference Projects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DMS app system is also already being used in routine care in the &quot;Herzmobil&quot; project in&#xD;
      Styria and Tyrol. Here, patients with chronic heart failure are cared for.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the DMS app is currently also being used in two other studies. These are&#xD;
      observational studies that are not subject to the Medical Devices Act. Both projects have a&#xD;
      positive ethics vote and are listed under the following titles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Telemedical follow-up of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)&#xD;
           DRKS ID of the study: DRKS00022244.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Building a training database of voice data recordings and body weight trajectories in&#xD;
           hemodialysis patients for algorithm development.&#xD;
