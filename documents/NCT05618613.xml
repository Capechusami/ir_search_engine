      This is a multicenter, phase 1b-2 trial. The phase 1b part of the trial is open label and&#xD;
      aims to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of onapristone and elacestrant when&#xD;
      administered together. The Phase 2 part of the trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      this combination in patients with ER+/PgR+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer after&#xD;
      prior therapy with a CDK4/6 inhibitor.&#xD;
