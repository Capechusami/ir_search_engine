    <textblock>
      In the United States, adolescents experience alarmingly high rates of major depression, and&#xD;
      gold-standard treatments are only effective for approximately half of patients. Rumination&#xD;
      may be a promising treatment target, as it is well-characterized at the neural level and&#xD;
      contributes to depression onset, maintenance, and recurrence as well as predicts treatment&#xD;
      non-response. Accordingly, the proposed research will investigate whether an innovative&#xD;
      mindfulness-based real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback&#xD;
      intervention successfully elicits change in the brain circuit underlying rumination to&#xD;
      improve clinical outcomes among depressed adolescents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent major depressive disorder (MDD) is common and debilitating. Presently,&#xD;
      gold-standard treatments are only effective for approximately half of patients, underscoring&#xD;
      the need to develop novel interventions, particularly to target core underlying mechanisms&#xD;
      and more effectively treat this recurrent disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rumination, the tendency to perseverate about depressive symptoms, contributes to MDD onset&#xD;
      and predicts treatment non-response and relapse. At the neural level, rumination is&#xD;
      characterized by elevated functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN), and&#xD;
      similarly, prior research has consistently demonstrated patterns of DMN hyper-connectivity in&#xD;
      MDD. Interestingly, mindfulness meditation, which trains attentional focus to the present&#xD;
      moment, reduces perseverative thinking, ruminative tendencies, and depression symptoms.&#xD;
      Further, our research and others have shown that adolescents can apply mindfulness practices&#xD;
      to decrease perceived stress, increase sustained attention, and suppress DMN activity.&#xD;
      Although mindfulness has profound mental health benefits, for some, mindfulness alone may not&#xD;
      be sufficient to mitigate ruminative tendencies during a depressive episode. That is, MDD&#xD;
      symptoms, including reduced motivation, inattention, and lack of self-efficacy, may impede a&#xD;
      patient's progress in successfully acquiring and utilizing mindfulness strategies necessary&#xD;
      to change perceptions about one's environment and relationships. To directly address this&#xD;
      challenge, this project will use real-time fMRI neurofeedback to enhance the acquisition and&#xD;
      utilization of mindfulness skills to better target DMN hyper-connectivity, rumination, and&#xD;
      depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, a novel, mindfulness-based, real-time neurofeedback (mbNF) paradigm will be&#xD;
      used whereby people observe a visual display of their brain activity and practice mindfulness&#xD;
      to volitionally reduce DMN activation. 90 adolescents (ages 13-18) diagnosed with MDD will&#xD;
      complete a 45-minute mindfulness training outside the scanner. To test target engagement of&#xD;
      reducing DMN hyper-connectivity and optimal dosing, adolescents will then be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either a 15- or a 30-minute mbNF session (n=45/dose group). Clinician-administered&#xD;
      instruments, self-reports, and ecological momentary assessment will be used test whether mbNF&#xD;
      contributes to a greater reduction in clinician assessed depression symptoms (primary&#xD;
      outcome) as well as decreased rumination (secondary outcome) across the post-treatment and&#xD;
      1-month post-treatment. As a whole, mbNF is directly in line with precision medicine&#xD;
      initiatives, and if successful, could revolutionize clinical care for depressed adolescents.&#xD;
