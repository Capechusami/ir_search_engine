  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate if a customizable support material allows to&#xD;
      improve the knowledge about the stage and subtype of the disease, as well as the indicated&#xD;
      treatments, in comparison with a non-customizable support material among patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main question it aims to answer is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ What is the impact of delivering a customizable support material so that patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer know and remember the stage and subtype of their disease, as well as the&#xD;
      indicated treatments, compared to non-customizable support material?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group will be provided customizable support material while&#xD;
      those in the standard group will receive a non-customizable material.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the present investigation, it is planned to carry out a prospective, multicenter study,&#xD;
      randomized and blinded to the statistician. Patients with a recent diagnosis of CM and who&#xD;
      are scheduled to have their first consultation in which their options will be discussed of&#xD;
      treatment to participate in the study. To those who agree to participate and sign the&#xD;
      informed consent, the protocol coordinator of each center will randomly assign them to the&#xD;
      intervention group or the standard group (in a 1:1 ratio) before the appointment medical. The&#xD;
      intervention group will receive customizable support material while the Standard group will&#xD;
      receive a non-customizable material (Annex 2). Additionally, you will be instructed to the&#xD;
      intervention group that the support material received can be filled with the information&#xD;
      discussed with the medical team. The protocol coordinator will obtain sociodemographic data&#xD;
      and clinicopathology of the medical records of the participants. After the next visit&#xD;
      follow-up, the coordinator will apply to both groups questionnaires about the knowledge of&#xD;
      the patient about his own disease, satisfaction with the support material received and&#xD;
      perceived ability to participate in discussions about their treatment, and the comprehension&#xD;
      of written materials (CHLT-6). After one month, both groups will respond knowledge&#xD;
      questionnaires to assess long-term information retention, disease uncertainty (SF-MUIS) and&#xD;
      satisfaction with medical information provided (EORTC-QLQ-INFO25).&#xD;
