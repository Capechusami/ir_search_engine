      This is a Phase III, double-blind, randomized multicenter study to compare the efficacy and&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of QL1701 and Herceptin® in patients with human&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, recurrent or previously untreated&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer. Eligible patients will be assessed centrally for HER2 status and&#xD;
      the presence of at least one measurable target lesion before randomization. Patients will&#xD;
      undergo a tumor assessment for evaluation of response according to Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) every 6 weeks up to 24 weeks (regardless of&#xD;
      the number of cycles actually given);&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Currently receiving other systemic antitumor therapies (such as chemotherapy and/or&#xD;
             immunotherapy) or other therapies not specified in the study protocol that may affect&#xD;
             the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Use of other investigational drugs within 28 days before signing the informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;

             asymptomatic or asymptomatic for at least 4 weeks after local lesion management and do&#xD;
             not require steroid treatment);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have a history of other malignant tumors within 5 years before signing the informed&#xD;
             consent, excluding cervical carcinoma in situ, basal cell carcinoma of the skin or&#xD;
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has received radical treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
