  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the cognitive and neural pathways underlying the joint impact of&#xD;
      chemical and social exposures on two aspects of cognitive function: cognitive control and&#xD;
      reward processing. The investigators will use high resolution, multi-band resting state and&#xD;
      task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as well as neuromelanin stain MRI to&#xD;
      identify pathways through which exposure to a mixture of prenatal chemical and early life&#xD;
      social exposures alters brain function and behavior. Specifically, the investigators will&#xD;
      leverage extant prenatal exposure data (N=550) from the Columbia Center for Children's&#xD;
      Environmental Health (CCCEH) Mothers and Newborns (MN) birth cohort and study symptoms and&#xD;
      brain function in adolescence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescence is a period of high risk for the emergence of psychiatric issues, particularly&#xD;
      attention problems, substance abuse, and psychotic experiences. Risk for these problems&#xD;
      likely originates in the prenatal period when the brain undergoes significant rapid change,&#xD;
      making this a particularly vulnerable time for alterations in brain development. Few studies&#xD;
      have examined risk from prenatal exposure to neurotoxicants that emerge in adolescence and&#xD;
      the biological pathways that underlie these associations. Emerging findings suggest that&#xD;
      prenatal exposure to environmental chemicals (e.g. environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), air&#xD;
      pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)) is associated with behavioral&#xD;
      symptoms of attentiondeficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), substance use disorders (SUD),&#xD;
      and psychotic disorders (PD). These symptoms often emerge across adolescence, and frequently&#xD;
      co-occur, suggesting shared underlying causes in the brain. Prenatal chemical exposures often&#xD;
      co-occur with each other and with social exposures, such as early life stress (ELS) that are&#xD;
      also associated with elevated behavioral symptoms. The joint contributions of these chemical&#xD;
      and social exposures to these behavioral symptoms are understudied, as are the cognitive and&#xD;
      neural pathways linking exposure to behavior.&#xD;

    <description>This is a 112-question scale for adolescents about their own behavioral functioning. It has a Likert-like scoring format and multiple syndrome and DSM-oriented scales, with higher scores indicating more symptoms. Raw scores are converted to T scores with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. The range is 0 to 90.</description>

        The current proposed study is funded to conduct resting state and task fMRI and assessment&#xD;
        of psychiatric symptoms in 250 adolescents in the Mothers and Newborns birth cohort.&#xD;
        Prenatal exposure data will be leveraged from the CCCEH database.&#xD;
