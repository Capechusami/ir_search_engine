  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Black women experience one of the highest incidences of HIV among all subpopulations in the&#xD;
      United States, but pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use among Black cisgender women is very&#xD;
      limited. The investigators will implement four strategies (provider training, patient&#xD;
      education, EMR optimization, and PrEP navigation) at 12 community health clinics in the&#xD;
      Midwest and South. The investigators predict that PrEP use and other related outcomes will&#xD;
      improve for participants after the intervention period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research Design After the investigators have adapted the POWER-Up strategies for use in the&#xD;
      new setting, the investigators will conduct a hybrid type II trial within the framework of a&#xD;
      cluster randomized, cross-sectional stepped wedge study. The investigators will use the&#xD;
      RE-AIM framework for evaluation. The investigators will utilize a cluster randomized,&#xD;
      cross-sectional stepped wedge trial, including sites in the South and the Midwest. This study&#xD;
      design will allow us to roll out the intervention across diverse geographic areas and assess&#xD;
      the change in clinical and implementation outcomes from the pre-intervention (control) and&#xD;
      the post intervention (intervention) periods. The cluster, or unit of analysis, is each CHC,&#xD;
      N=12 (8 in the South, 4 in the Midwest). In a stepped wedge study, each cluster contributes&#xD;
      both time and observations to the control condition (usual care) and the intervention&#xD;
      condition (strategies to increase PrEP use). Every cluster switches from the control to the&#xD;
      intervention at regular time intervals (&quot;steps&quot;), but at different points in calendar time.&#xD;
      More than one cluster may start the intervention at a step, but the step at which a cluster&#xD;
      switches from control to intervention is randomized. The design is cross-sectional as&#xD;
      outcomes are obtained from the subset of patients seen during each time period at each clinic&#xD;
      rather than following individually recruited patients over time. This use of clinics under&#xD;
      both intervention and control conditions improves precision when intra-cluster correlation is&#xD;
      high, which is likely among the CHCs the investigators have chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our stepped wedge design, each step is 6 months long, and there are 4 waves of&#xD;
      intervention implementation (three sites begin the intervention at the same step, a mix from&#xD;
      the South and the Midwest, N=12). Three CHC sites will be randomized to each step occurring&#xD;
      at 6-month intervals. Each cluster also undergoes a 6-month transition period when the&#xD;
      individual clinics will prepare to implement the intervention package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the investigators hypothesize that the effect of this intervention will increase&#xD;
      PrEP uptake among participants, the investigators powered this study to ensure that the&#xD;
      investigators could detect a range of intervention effectiveness. The investigators used the&#xD;
      R statistical package swCRTdesign V3.1 to verify that a sample of 50 participants at 6&#xD;
      different times (&quot;steps&quot;) each lasting 6 months, at the 12 CHC sites (&quot;clusters&quot;) provides&#xD;
      adequate power (&gt;80%) to detect a change from a baseline of 1% of eligible participants&#xD;
      receiving prescriptions for PrEP to 2% with an ICC of 0.2 and a CAC of 0.80.60. This minimum&#xD;
      sample size per time interval is one that can easily be met by all of the clinics used as&#xD;
      sites in this study (100 eligible participants per calendar year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key element of the research infrastructure will be AllianceChicago's uniform EMR system,&#xD;
      which is distinguished by the integration of evidence-based practice recommendations into the&#xD;
      end user interface to provide clinical decision support at the point of care.&#xD;
      AllianceChicago's information technology (IT) team will create a study specific fields to&#xD;
      measure study outcomes. The IT team will build custom reports in their data warehouse to&#xD;
      access and validate in real-time. Reports will be built to pull data (ICD, CPT/HCPCS, and&#xD;
      RXNORM codes, laboratory results, demographic characteristics) from the medical record and&#xD;
      billing claims, and will be used to determine implementation success for the RE-AIM outcomes&#xD;
      of effectiveness and maintenance. The investigators will utilize the Health Catalyst Tool&#xD;
      which already has reports built to monitor PrEP care continuum outcomes. Additional reports&#xD;
      will be built to monitor: 1) Participants who receive HIV risk assessment 2) participants who&#xD;
      receive PrEP education; 3) participants who receive PrEP navigation; 4) PrEP prescriptions&#xD;
      among eligible participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation Patient education: CHC staff will perform HIV risk assessment for participants&#xD;
      who present at the CHCs for care. HIV risk assessment will consist of asking questions&#xD;
      regarding PrEP indications adapted from the USHS guidelines for PrEP (e.g., sexual partners,&#xD;
      recent STIs, condom use, drug use, etc). For participants who meet criteria of &quot;PrEP&#xD;
      eligibility,&quot; patient education regarding PrEP will be provided. Patient education occurs at&#xD;
      each clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provider training: Providers will complete 3 sessions of 1-hour virtual trainings regarding&#xD;
      PrEP (providing patient education, identifying PrEP-eligible participants, offering PrEP,&#xD;
      etc.). CHCs will provide protected time for providers to complete the trainings. Trainings&#xD;
      will be virtual but also interactive, including the opportunities for providers to use&#xD;
      electronic avatars to practice difficult conversations with virtual participants. Monthly&#xD;
      audit and feedback will be provided post-training to measure and support sustained behavior&#xD;
      change. The investigators will integrate PrEP outcomes reports into the overall quality&#xD;
      metric reporting for each clinic. Every month the medical director of each clinic reviews&#xD;
      quality metrics for the clinical site. The medical director reports the metrics during&#xD;
      monthly clinic meetings and steps are taken to address any metrics that fall short of the&#xD;
      expected benchmark. Data on clinic staff's use of PrEP clinical decision support tools and&#xD;
      PrEP care continuum outcomes will be incorporated into standard monthly quality report.&#xD;
      During monthly site check-ins, the investigators will review this data with the medical&#xD;
      director and clinical champions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMR optimization: AllianceChicago will incorporate PrEP clinical decision support, including&#xD;
      PrEP indication documentation, PrEP order set, and electronic notifications of PrEP-eligible&#xD;
      participants into the CHC's EMR and provide weekly reports of PrEP care continuum outcomes&#xD;
      for the CHC to review and act upon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PrEP navigation: The investigators will work with the CHCs to engage staff in the adapted&#xD;
      PrEP support roles using manualized procedures and training. PrEP navigators will meet with&#xD;
      participants 2-3 times initially to support PrEP uptake, and will check in with patients&#xD;
      monthly thereafter (appointment, refill reminders will be based on participants' own&#xD;
      schedules).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and Process Evaluation with Feedback: The investigators will track the&#xD;
      implementation process and provide feedback and support to the CHC for challenges in&#xD;
      implementing the strategies, as well as ongoing feedback on interim outcomes including number&#xD;
      of participants who underwent HIV risk assessment, the number who discussed PrEP with a&#xD;
      provider, proportion initiating PrEP, and results of provider training. Results will be&#xD;
      discussed between the research team and each CHC to understand barriers and identify and&#xD;
      document adaptations needed using Stirman's FRAME methodology. Broadly, the investigators&#xD;
      will discuss and document (1) what and why the investigators adapted, (2) goals of the&#xD;
      adaptation, (3) who was involved in the adaptation process, (4) when the investigators&#xD;
      adapted, (5) forms of adaptation, and (6) measurement and evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation: Utilizing the RE-AIM framework, the investigators will evaluate the success of&#xD;
      the implementation strategies. The investigators will gather feedback from CHC providers,&#xD;
      staff, and participants using mixed methods with both quantitative surveys and qualitative&#xD;
      interviews. For evaluation of the provider training, The investigators will use the&#xD;
      Kirkpatrick four-level training evaluation model. The investigators will use provider-level&#xD;
      quantitative surveys to assess the four-levels of training: satisfaction and perceived value&#xD;
      (Level 1); knowledge and self-efficacy (Level 2); application of knowledge (Level 3; i.e.,&#xD;
      number of participants offered PrEP); and effectiveness (Level 4; i.e., the increase in&#xD;
      proportion of participants on PrEP). Data regarding number of participants who had PrEP&#xD;
      education, discussions, and who initiated and persisted on PrEP will be collected from the&#xD;
      EMR with electronic reports developed by AllianceChicago. To assess provider and CHC staff&#xD;
      feedback about the implementation strategies, the investigators will use surveys to assess&#xD;
      the following measures: Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM)), appropriateness&#xD;
      (Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM)), and feasibility (Feasibility of Intervention&#xD;
      Measure (FIM)). In addition, the investigators will recruit 400 participants to complete&#xD;
      surveys regarding acceptability (AIM) of the POWER Up strategies.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study will use a cluster randomized, cross-sectional stepped wedge study with 12 clusters (8 CHCs from the South and 4 CHCs from the Midwest) to evaluate the effect of the intervention package as compared to the control condition (usual care) on the proportion of PrEP prescriptions among eligible participants. Cross-sectional data from participants who are eligible for PrEP will be collected at 6 different calendar intervals of 6 months (&quot;steps&quot;). Although all clusters will begin the study in the control condition (usual care), beginning in step 3 at each six-month interval three randomly chosen CHCs (containing a mix of Southern and Midwestern CHCs) will switch from the control condition to the intervention condition. Beginning at step 2, the step prior to 3 CHCs switching from control to intervention condition will be spent in a six-month transition period. This design will allow for data collection at all CHCs to contain observations from both intervention and control periods.</intervention_model_description>
