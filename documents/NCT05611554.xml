      assessed to determine eligibility for study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet eligibility requirements will receive psychological intervention consisting&#xD;
      in 3-session group ACT-based treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be assessed through self-report instruments before and after treatment&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline perceived stress at 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a one-dimensional scale with 14 items that are answered on a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (Never) to 5 (Very often). The direct scores range from 0 to 56; higher scores indicate higher perceived stress and worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Parental Acceptance Questionnaire (6-PAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Psychological Inflexibility at 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parental Acceptance Questionnaire (6-PAQ) is a 16-item questionnaire on a Likert-type scale with four answer options in a range from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 4 (Strongly Agree) that assesses six processes related to psychological flexibility (being present, values, committed action, self as context, cognitive defusion, and acceptance) and three flexible response styles (opened, centred and committed). The scores vary from 16 to 64; the higher the score, the higher psychological inflexibility levels and worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Psychological Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Psychological Well-Being at 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Psychological Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) contains 12 items on a Likert-type scale with four answer options in a range from 0 (Strongly Disagree) to 3 (Strongly Agree). Higher scores indicate lower levels of psychological well-being and worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in White Bear Suppression Inventory (WBSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline thoughts suppression at 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>White Bear Suppression Inventory (WBSI) evaluates the tendency to suppress unwanted thoughts. It is a Likert scale of 15 items with five response options ranging from 1 (Completely Disagree) to 5 (Completely Agree). Scores range from 15 to 75. Higher scores indicate a stronger thought suppression tendency and worse outcomes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Behavioural self-monitoring</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline punitive-hostile and supportive-companion behaviours at 1 month.</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral self-monitoring captures behaviour change. Family members recorded a daily estimation of the frequency of two categories of behaviours: punitive-hostile behaviours from family members to children with disabilities (e.g., shouting, punishments, insults, or aggressions) and supportive-companion behaviours (e.g., helping, shared leisure and recognition or compliments). A Likert-type scale was used to estimate frequency, with values from 0 to 4 (0= never; 1= almost never; 2= sometimes; 3= often; and 4= always) Participants completed daily self-monitoring, starting one week before the intervention (forming the baseline scenario) until one week after the intervention, obtaining a total of 4 measures. Higher scores in punitive-hostile behaviours indicate higher levels of punitive-hostile behaviours and worse outcome. Higher scores in supportive-companion behaviours indicate higher levels of supportive-companion behaviours and better outcome.</description>
