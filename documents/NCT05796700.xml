  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the most common subtype of liver cancer (85% ~ 90%), HCC is highly malignant; thus, one of&#xD;
      the crucial issues in HCC management is an effective therapy for tumors at an early stage,&#xD;
      which is vital for improving the prognosis of patients. For ≤3cm HCC, ablation has been&#xD;
      recommended by international guidelines as a first-line or alternative treatment because of&#xD;
      similar survival outcomes and milder liver function injury with liver resection (LR).&#xD;
      However, the appropriate treatment options for 3-5cm HCC remain controversial. Thus, none of&#xD;
      the international guidelines recommend ablation as a first-line treatment for 3-5cm HCC. In&#xD;
      the past few decades, treatment for HCC has tended to be less invasive, have fewer&#xD;
      complications, and have higher cost-effectiveness. Compared with LR, laparoscopic Hepatectomy&#xD;
      (LH) demonstrates the advancement of minimal invasion. As another minimally invasive&#xD;
      technique for HCC, Microwave Ablation (MWA) has the potential to eradicate larger HCCs with&#xD;
      larger coagulation areas and is less affected by the heat sink effect caused by vessels&#xD;
      around the tumor. Many studies have identified the potential advantages of MWA over other&#xD;
      ablation techniques. However, to date, no clinical studies have compared the efficacy of LH&#xD;
      and MWA therapies for 3-5cm HCC with periodic progression.&#xD;

    <description>According to the shape, size and location of each patient's tumor, as well as the adjacent relationship with the surrounding organs, the individual MWA scheme was pre-established. Contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT) or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) was used to evaluate complete ablation within 3 to 5 days after ablation. If radiography suggested incomplete ablation, supplementary ablation was performed as soon as the patient's condition permitted. A cooled-shaft MW system (KY-2000, Kangyou Medical, China) was used in the procedure.</description>

    <description>The optimal surgical procedure for each patient depends on the characteristics of the tumor. Patients were placed in French position and a laparoscopic-assisted partial hepatectomy was performed under CO2 pneumoperitoneum pressure 12-14 mmHg (1 mmHg =0.133 kPa). In most cases, a 4-well or 5-well method was used under general anesthesia.</description>
