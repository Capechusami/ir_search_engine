    <textblock>
      This study will recruit 20 male and female athletes of endurance training background. They&#xD;
      will participate in 50 minutes of vigorous activity on a treadmill with 3 blood draws (before&#xD;
      exercising, 50 minutes into exercising, and 30 minutes after completion of exercising). After&#xD;
      collection of the blood samples, the results will be analyzed for extracellular vesicles and&#xD;
      biochemical changes within said extracellular vesicles.&#xD;

      This study will recruit participants from the Touro University Nevada student body by placing&#xD;
      flyers around campus and including announcements on the TUN screens. Program faculty will be&#xD;
      encouraged to promote the study to their students through March.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 male and female athletes who currently participate in regular endurance training will be&#xD;
      recruited for the study. We will use men because the hormonal responses to exercise vary&#xD;
      between men and women and is blunted at different points during the reproductive cycle.&#xD;
      Participants recruited into the study will be normal weight (BMI or waist-to-hip ratio), and&#xD;
      a history of regular participation in endurance training (see flyer). Participants will not&#xD;
      have been diagnosed or treated for any psychiatric conditions, lower extremity or low back&#xD;
      injury and will not have regularly taken any prescription medications within the past year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be consented into the study, scheduled, and given pre-participation&#xD;
      instructions one week prior to the event. They will not take over-the-counter medications or&#xD;
      supplements within one week of the trial, have no alcohol within 72 hours and no caffeine or&#xD;
      nicotine within four hours, and no food within two hours of the protocol. Participants may&#xD;
      drink water ad libitum prior to the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arriving the day of the trial, participants will be screened by urinalysis for drug use.&#xD;
      They will complete a survey based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire which&#xD;
      will be used to classify their history of physical activity. They will complete a&#xD;
      pre-activity screen of their current emotional state using a set of Visual Analog Scales&#xD;
      (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the trial, participants will provide a urine sample for urinalysis. They will&#xD;
      complete an electronic survey on their cell phone and will complete a paper survey including&#xD;
      a set of visual analog scales. A butterfly needle will be inserted into their arm of choice&#xD;
      which will allow the four small (5 ml) blood samples to be drawn throughout the activity. The&#xD;
      first sample will be drawn immediately upon inserting the needle with subsequent draws&#xD;
      performed at 50-minutes of physical activity, and the final draw 30-minutes after the&#xD;
      activity ends. They will wear a heart monitor that will be used to monitor exercise intensity&#xD;
      throughout the exercise protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete an exercise protocol that includes 50 minutes of vigorous activity&#xD;
      on a treadmill. They will be instructed to perform a 5-minute warm up and then begin running&#xD;
      at a rate and treadmill elevation that ensures that they are working at 76-96% of their&#xD;
      age-adjusted maximum heart rate. An attendant will monitor their heart rate throughout the&#xD;
      protocol to ensure compliance. The participant will continue to exercise while blood is drawn&#xD;
      at 50-minutes of activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A butterfly needle will be inserted into the arm of their choice. A baseline sample of 5 ml&#xD;
      of blood will be drawn immediately with subsequent 5 ml samples drawn at 25- and 50-minutes&#xD;
      into the exercise protocol. A final 5 ml sample will be drawn at 30 minutes after completion&#xD;
      of the protocol. The butterfly needle will be removed immediately after the final blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endorphin response has been documented at 70% of age-adjusted maximum heart rate and&#xD;
      increases linearly after that. A heart monitor will be worn throughout the trial to monitor&#xD;
      exercise intensity which will be determined based on the ACSM guidelines for vigorous&#xD;
      exercise, 76-96% of the participant's age-adjusted maximum heart rate (AAMHR). Participants&#xD;
      will be instructed to perform a 5-minute warm up and then begin running. A monitor will&#xD;
      ensure that the participant maintains the target intensity throughout the activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the physical activity, participants will be offered healthy snacks while&#xD;
      they walk, sit, or lie down anywhere within the lab. They will complete the second set of VAS&#xD;
      ratings of emotional state that will be used to differentiate runners who experience&#xD;
      &quot;runner's high&quot; from those who do not. The final 5 ml of blood will be drawn 30 minutes after&#xD;
      completion of the exercise protocol after which the participant will take off the heart&#xD;
      monitor and leave the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collection of the blood samples, the results will be separated into blood plasma. The&#xD;
      blood plasma will be analyzed for extracellular vesicles and quantitative biochemical changes&#xD;
      within said extracellular vesicles.&#xD;
