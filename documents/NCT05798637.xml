    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational study aimed at testing the existence of an association&#xD;
      between frailty, inflammatory status, and degree of platelet activation and reactivity in&#xD;
      elderly subjects with type 2 diabetes or coronary artery disease or Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty in the elderly is a syndrome that strongly affects quality of life and represents a&#xD;
      major social and economic challenge. Frailty often, and more frequently, occurs in&#xD;
      individuals with aging-related diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      and Alzheimer's disease. All of these diseases are associated with a state of weak chronic&#xD;
      inflammation. Studies in recent years have pointed out that platelets can directly contribute&#xD;
      to inflammatory processes. Due to of this ability to act as proinflammatory cells and of&#xD;
      their strong involvement in various metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative&#xD;
      disorders, platelets appear to have key roles in the physio-pathological mechanisms that&#xD;
      predispose to frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, it is planned to recruit 4 cohorts of elderly patients, each of 40&#xD;
      patients, divided by pathology ( frail elderly, diabetic elderly, elderly with stable&#xD;
      atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, elderly with early-stage Alzheimer's disease) and a&#xD;
      cohort of 40 healthy elderly subjects. All subjects will perform a blood draw at enrollment&#xD;
      and after 24 months of follow up in order to evaluate: the state of platelet activation; the&#xD;
      aggregating response of platelets to stimuli such as thrombin, Adenosine DiPhosphate (ADP),&#xD;
      and collagen; the state of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress; the procoagulant&#xD;
      profile of platelets; presence of platelet subpopulations characterized by RNA, microRNA&#xD;
      and/or protein profiling. Each subject will also be given a questionnaire to assess frailty&#xD;
      status (according to Fried's criteria) and urine samples will be collected to perform the&#xD;
      assay of metabolites such as 11dh-TXB, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 8-epiPGF2a&#xD;
      (8-isoprostane).&#xD;
