  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will assess the efficacy and scalability of a blood pressure&#xD;
      technology system intervention. The investigators will enroll 224 older adults with&#xD;
      hypertension to identify those who are nonadherent for one hypertension medication. The&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to one of two groups (112 per group) to use the blood&#xD;
      pressure system for 6-months. Both groups receive information about high blood pressure and&#xD;
      medications. One group will also receive strategies that can be used to take medications and&#xD;
      manage blood pressure. Both groups will complete a mid-assessment at 3-months and a&#xD;
      post-assessment at 6-months.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-months, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in adherence (both objective and subjective) after 6 months of M system engagement versus E system use. Objective adherence is measured by Aardex Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS). Subjective adherence is measured by the five-item Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS-5). MARS-5 total score ranges between 5 and 25, with higher scores indicating better adherence.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>systolic blood pressure (BP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-months, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>6-month change in mean seated systolic BP among M system users versus E system users.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>perceived competence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-months, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>6-month change in perceived competence among M system users versus E system users. The four-item Perceived Competence Scale (PCS) is used to measure self-determination competence. PCS total score ranges between 4 and 28, with higher scores indicating higher perceived competence with medication adherence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>perceived autonomy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-months, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>6-month change in perceived autonomy among M system users versus E system users. The Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire (TSRQ) is used to measure individual differences in the types of motivation or regulation. Each of the 15 questionnaire items represents a reason for engaging in or changing a health behavior. Responses use a seven-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all true) to 7 (very true). Higher numbers indicate higher autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, or amotivation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>mobile device proficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-months, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>6-month change in mobile device proficiency among M system users versus E system users. Proficiency is measured with the Mobile Device Proficiency Questionnaire (MDPQ-16). The MDPQ-16 total score ranges from 8 to 40, with higher scores reflecting greater proficiency.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data and resources generated during the performance of the project will be shared with the research community primarily via conference presentations, journal articles, and summary reports made available on laboratory and company websites. Technical manuals created during the project may be made publicly available via websites geared towards sharing resources in the research community or licensed, as appropriate, and after University review. Completely de-identified final data will be shared with existing and new collaborators of the laboratories participating in the project and with new collaborators who may initiate contact by emailing one of the PIs, using HIPAA-compliant file transfer methods once the investigators complete a data-sharing agreement. The data-sharing agreement will ensure that privacy, confidentiality standards, and data security will be maintained at the recipient site and will prohibit manipulation of data</ipd_description>
