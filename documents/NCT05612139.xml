  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been planned as part of the Orthofix Srl post-market active surveillance plan&#xD;
      for the collection of data on both the clinical performance and the safety profile of the&#xD;
      JTIN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of the proposed study is to update and support the pre-market clinical&#xD;
      evaluation of the JTIN with Real World Evidence clinical data in a real-life surgical&#xD;
      setting, in order to confirm the benefit/risk ratio of this medical device and to keep the CE&#xD;
      mark under Medical Device Regulation (MDR) requirements. One selected site, experienced in&#xD;
      the treatment of pediatric patients with OI, where the usage of JTIN is already part of the&#xD;
      normal clinical practice, will participate in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One selected site, experienced in the treatment of pediatric patients with OI, where the&#xD;
      usage of JTIN is already part of the normal clinical practice, will participate in this&#xD;
      study. Investigator will screen patients treated (or planned to be treated) with JTIN to&#xD;
      verify inclusion and exclusion criteria, to achieve the enrollment of 25 cases. With lost to&#xD;
      follow-up percentage estimated at 20%, this will lead to a total of 20 evaluable cases, i.e.&#xD;
      20 implanted JTIN (some patients may contribute for more than one implant). Patients are&#xD;
      prospectively and retrospectively enrolled in the study: they may have undergone JTIN&#xD;
      implantation from the 1st of January 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients, since this study is non-interventional and observational, will follow the&#xD;
      standard medical practice of the site: no requirements regarding the treatment of patients&#xD;
      will be imposed on the site or Principal Investigator and the Sponsor will not in any manner&#xD;
      influence the treatment decisions. Data of enrolled subjects will be collected for this study&#xD;
      up to 1 year from surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hospital standard care usually, but not exclusively, includes: surgery, discharge and&#xD;
      plaster removal visits, and then 3 other follow up visits up to 1 year from surgery (see&#xD;
      &quot;Visits and Assessments Schedule&quot;). Visits frequency is estimated as average of the site&#xD;
      normal clinical practice, actual visit timing for each patient will be performed according to&#xD;
      investigators and hospital staff evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient data will be systematically collected by the investigator in eCRF.&#xD;

    <description>The JTIN is a self-extending intramedullary nail (telescopic rod) designed to provide fixation of femoral and/or tibial fractures, osteotomies, malunions and non-unions. The design of the JTIN includes a female and a male component, which are anchored to the proximal cortex and distal epiphysis through screw-type fixation. These two components slide from each other, allowing for extension of the JTIN as the bone structures remodel and patient growth occurs.</description>
