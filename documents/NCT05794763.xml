  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This present study will compare the efficacy of in-person versus virtually-delivered Body&#xD;
      Project groups. It will also evaluate whether this body acceptance class produces greater&#xD;
      reductions in eating disorder risk factor symptoms (pursuit of the thin ideal, body&#xD;
      dissatisfaction, dieting, dietary restraint, negative affect, eating disorder symptoms, and&#xD;
      the future onset of eating disorders over a 3-month follow-up in this population. It will&#xD;
      also evaluate the effectiveness of this body acceptance class's ability to impact social&#xD;
      appearance anxiety, body compassion, and self-stigma surrounding attaining help.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dozens of eating disorder prevention programs have been evaluated, but only the 4-hr Body&#xD;
      Project has reduced eating disorder symptoms and future eating disorder onset over 3-4 year&#xD;
      follow-up, produced larger reductions in outcomes than credible alternative interventions,&#xD;
      been shown to engage the intervention target (valuation of the thin beauty ideal), and&#xD;
      produced effects in trials from several independent teams. The proposed study will evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of a peer-implemented, virtually delivered, body acceptance class compared&#xD;
      to a peer-implemented, in-person delivery of the same class. Participation in the&#xD;
      intervention will last four weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to the in-person or&#xD;
      virtual body acceptance class. Assessments will take place at pre-intervention,&#xD;
      post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>In the in-person peer-led group intervention, participants voluntarily engage in verbal, written, and behavioral exercises in which they critique and discuss the costs of pursuing the thin-ideal ideal. The intervention is 4 sessions long (1-hr each) and is administered by trained peer facilitators who use an intervention script. Participants will be asked to complete weekly home exercises throughout the course of the intervention.</description>
