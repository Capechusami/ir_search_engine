  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to test a precision (person-specific and&#xD;
      context-sensitive) messaging algorithm for increasing physical activity and slowing weight&#xD;
      gain in insufficiently-active young adults. The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does physical activity increase more when text messages are sent based on a precision&#xD;
           rule for selecting and timing messages compared to when the same message content is&#xD;
           selected and sent at random or not at all?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do biological or social characteristics of young adults make them more likely to respond&#xD;
           positively to the precision messaging intervention than either of the other two&#xD;
           interventions?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with education about health-enhancing physical activity and&#xD;
      given an activity tracker to wear for 12 months. They will then be randomly assigned to one&#xD;
      of three groups. Participants in one group (Precision AIM) will receive up to 4 messages/day&#xD;
      selected and timed based on a person-specific algorithm that forecasts possible message&#xD;
      effects periodically throughout the day. Messages will be drawn from one of three content&#xD;
      libraries: move more, sit less, or inspirational quotes. Participants in a second group&#xD;
      (Random AIM) will receive 4 messages/day selected at random from the same three content&#xD;
      libraries and delivered at random times within their availability window. Participants in the&#xD;
      third group (No AIM) will receive not motivational messages but will randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      Random AIM group will receive up to 4 messages/day drawn at random from three content&#xD;
      libraries at randomly-selected times. Step counts and weight will be assessed at baseline,&#xD;
      and at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months. Researchers will compare Precision AIM,&#xD;
      Random AIM and No AIM groups to see if physical activity increased more and weight gain was&#xD;
      slower in Precision AIM than Random AIM or No AIM after 3, 6, and 12 months of intervention,&#xD;
      and 6 months after the intervention is complete (18 months).&#xD;
