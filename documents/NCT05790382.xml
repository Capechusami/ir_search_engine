      This is a Phase I, double-blind, randomised, two-part, single-ascending dose (Part 1) and&#xD;

      non-childbearing potential&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NM-101 is an anti-TLR2 antibody which may have clinical efficacy in Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      patients. This Phase I study aims to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK) of single and multiple ascending doses of NM-101 in healthy males and healthy females of&#xD;
      non-childbearing potential. A total of 56 subjects (8 per cohort) are planned to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to recieve NM-101 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. The study&#xD;
      will be in 2 parts: Part 1 will consist of 3 single-dose cohorts; Part 2 will consist of 4&#xD;
      multiple-dose cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, sentinel dosing will be applied. In each cohort, 1 subject will be randomised to&#xD;
      receive NM-101 and 1 subject will be randomised to receive placebo ahead of dosing in the&#xD;
      remaining 6 subjects. The dose for Cohort 1 is 20 mg/kg NN-101. The predicted doses for&#xD;
      Cohorts 2 and 3 are 40 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg NM-101, respectively (dependent on a blinded&#xD;
      interim review of the safety, tolerability and PK data). Blood samples will be collected at&#xD;
      regular intervals for PK analysis and safety from Day 1 until Day 42.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, sentinel dosing will not be applied. Each subject will receive 4 doses of NM-101&#xD;
      or placebo over the course of 3 months. Dosing may occur in parallel to the conduct of Part&#xD;
      1. The doses administered will be selected based on emerging safety, tolerability and PK data&#xD;
      from preceding groups in Part 1. The predicted NM-101 doses are: 10 mg/kg for Cohort 4; 20&#xD;
      mg/kg for Cohort 5; 40 mg/kg for Cohort 6; 60 mg/kg for Cohort 7. In Cohorts 5 to 7, subjects&#xD;
      will undergo a lumbar puncture to assess NM-101 concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected at regular intervals for PK analysis and safety from Day 1&#xD;
      until Day 127.&#xD;
