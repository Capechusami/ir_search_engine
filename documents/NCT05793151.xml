  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness of a navigation-based&#xD;
      multilevel intervention (ENDURE) with treatment as usual at decreasing delays starting&#xD;
      guideline-adherent postoperative radiation therapy among patients with head and neck cancer.&#xD;
      The main questions the trial aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does ENDURE decrease delays starting PORT relative to treatment as usual?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the mechanisms through which ENDURE reduces treatment delays?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the barriers and facilitators to implementing ENDURE across diverse clinical&#xD;
           settings?&#xD;

      In this hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation study, the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial with cancer centers (n=4; 484 patients) randomized to&#xD;
      sequentially deliver treatment as usual (TAU) then ENDURE to patients with head and neck&#xD;
      cancer undergoing surgery and postoperative radiation therapy (PORT). The trial will assess&#xD;
      the effect of ENDURE vs TAU on delays starting PORT (primary objective), racial disparities&#xD;
      in PORT delay (secondary objective), and the underlying mechanisms of ENDURE (secondary&#xD;
      objective). The investigators will concurrently conduct a mixed-methods study with&#xD;
      quantitative measures of implementation outcomes and qualitative data about implementation&#xD;
      determinants from semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders and site visits (secondary&#xD;
      objective).&#xD;

    <description>ENDURE provides patient education through the ENDURE Patient Resource Guide and social support by linking patients to community resources (patient-level), standardizes discussions about expectations for PORT and clinical documentation to enhance communication and care coordination within and across interprofessional cancer teams (team-level), and implements referral tracking across fragmented health systems (organization-level). To facilitate care coordination, ENDURE modifies existing standard of care patient navigation (an evidence-based intervention that addresses barriers to timely cancer care) by adding PORT-focused navigation at three key care transitions: into the cancer care system; from inpatient to outpatient after surgery; and from the surgical team to the radiation oncology team.</description>

    <ipd_description>Below are the key elements of the data sharing plan as outlined in the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing:&#xD;
Research materials will include: (1) self-report measures from patients; (2) clinical data from the electronic medical record; (3) audio recordings and transcriptions of interviews from stakeholders; and (4) field notes from direct observations of the delivery of ENDURE at each site. Data will be raw or minimally processed. The investigators plan to use REDCap for data capture and management of the clinical and self-report measure data and NVivo for management of the qualitative data. REDCap data dictionaries can be distributed for reuse. The final data dictionaries have not been developed. Scientific data and metadata will be generated, preserved, and shared using NIH common data elements. Scientific data and metadata arising from the project will be uploaded to openICPSR, a self-publishing repository for social, behavioral, and health sciences research data.</ipd_description>
