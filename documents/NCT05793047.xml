  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an experimental, observational, prospective study designed to develop medical&#xD;
      knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study was to identify clinically significant, easily interpretable,&#xD;
      quantitative indices of fatigue-related gait pattern changes in post-stroke hemiplegic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is part of a usual framework of management of post-stroke hemiplegic patients with&#xD;
      additional data collection, via the use of inertial measurement units, considered here as&#xD;
      non-interventional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this identification, 2 6-minute walk tests will be performed for each patient at&#xD;
      the beginning and end of the same day. Patient-perceived fatigue will be recorded by the Borg&#xD;
      scale every minute during the 6-minute test. The level of activity during the rehabilitation&#xD;
      day is also part of the data collected (number of hours of physical and non-physical&#xD;
      activity). At the end of the second 6-minute test, the patient's participation in the study&#xD;
      ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the inertial measurement, two scores will be collected to assess the&#xD;
      correlation between fatigability and the level of anxiety/depression and stroke severity :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD)&#xD;

    <description>Questionnaire Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD) The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD) questionnaire is used to screen for anxiety and depressive disorders. It includes 14 items rated from 0 to 3. Seven questions relate to anxiety (total A) and seven others to the depressive dimension (total D), thus making it possible to obtain two scores (maximum score for each score: 21). A score close to 0 means no anxiety symptoms a score close to 11 and above indicates anxiety symptoms. This scale is validated in French.</description>

Total scores on the NIHSS range from 0 to 42, with higher values reflecting more severe brain damage.</description>
