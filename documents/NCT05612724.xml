      A pilot study was initiated to assess feasibility of testing asymptomatic dental patients&#xD;
      presenting to the Oral Medicine Clinic at Rutgers School of Dental Medicine for SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      viral antigen using a point-of-care (POC) Rapid Antigen test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14 subjects with upcoming appointment at the Oral Medicine clinic, Rutgers School of Dental&#xD;
      Medicine, with no history of documented COVID-19 infection or viral exposure, were enrolled&#xD;
      in a study that interrogated patients' perceptions of safety and feedback regarding their&#xD;
      testing experience. All 14 patients expressed initial interest, however, 10 patients&#xD;
      completed informed consent and completed study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institutional Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification of waiver was&#xD;
      obtained prior to conducting the study. Communicable Diseases Reporting and Surveillance&#xD;
      System (CDRSS) registration and training were completed to enable reporting results of the&#xD;
      POC test.&#xD;

      A pilot study was initiated to assess feasibility of testing asymptomatic dental patients&#xD;
      presenting to the Oral Medicine Clinic at Rutgers School of Dental Medicine for SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      viral antigen using a point-of-care (POC) Rapid Antigen test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      14 subjects with upcoming appointment at the Oral Medicine clinic, Rutgers School of Dental&#xD;
      Medicine, with no history of documented COVID-19 infection or viral exposure, were enrolled&#xD;
      in a study that interrogated patients' perceptions of safety and feedback regarding their&#xD;
      testing experience. All 14 patients expressed initial interest, however, 10 patients&#xD;
      completed informed consent and completed study procedures on their appointments, the&#xD;
      remaining 4 patients did not present for their appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following initial interest in participation over the phone, the subjects completed a&#xD;
      pre-visit survey prior to their upcoming appointment. The day prior to their visit, a phone&#xD;
      triage was completed and repeated as they checked in for their appointment. A nasal sample&#xD;
      was collected and processed using the FDA EUA authorized Rapid Antigen Test BD Veritor Plus&#xD;
      Analyzer, BD Sciences. An end-of-study survey was collected to assess patients' feedback&#xD;
      about their experience and their perception of safety.&#xD;
