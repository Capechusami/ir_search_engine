  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fear of childbirth, or what has historically been called tokophobia, is often described as a&#xD;
      severe fear of birth and pathological fear of childbirth. The reasons for fear of childbirth&#xD;
      are stated as biological reasons, psychological reasons and lack of social support. However,&#xD;
      it is still not possible to clearly explain the reasons for the fear of childbirth in&#xD;
      pregnant women and the risk factors affecting them. The reasons for the fear of childbirth&#xD;
      and the affecting factors have not been fully explained.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between fear of childbirth and anxiety&#xD;
      sensitivity in pregnant women, and whether the mode of delivery changes depending on this&#xD;
      fear and these data. The aim of the authors is to reveal the frequency and causes of&#xD;
      tokophobia in pregnant women followed in their clinics and to show the birth patterns of&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
