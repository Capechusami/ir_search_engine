  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with head and neck cancer post-radiotherapy may improve their perceived and amount&#xD;
      of saliva after a 3-month Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy focuses on three main salivary&#xD;
      glands (parotid, submandibular and sublingual glands).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of PBM therapy in survivors with head and neck cancer may be an effective treatment&#xD;
      to improve xerostomia and hyposalivation as side effects of radiotherapy. Although there is&#xD;
      some scientific evidence on its benefits during or after radiotherapy, it is not sufficient&#xD;
      to establish it as an effective treatment. For these reasons, studies of higher&#xD;
      methodological quality such as randomized controlled trials, are needed. This study aims to&#xD;
      demonstrate the benefits of PBM therapy on xerostomia and hyposalivation in survivors with&#xD;
      head and neck cancer undergone radiotherapy, and whether the effects are maintained after a&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to one of the two study groups using a random number generation program (www.randomizer.org). The randomization sequence will be prepared by a member external to the investigation to respect the masking in terms of randomization of the participants, thus reducing the risk of bias during the evaluations. Therefore both patients and evaluator will be masked.</masking_description>
