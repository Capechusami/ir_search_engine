  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New treatment regimens with increased efficiency and reduced toxicities are being introduced&#xD;
      in the treatment of Multiple Myeloma (MM). As a result, patients can expect increased&#xD;
      survival, but also increased time on active treatment. Consequently, patients spend an&#xD;
      increasing amount of time at the hospital and on transportation. This may not only expose the&#xD;
      patients to unnecessary risks of infections, but will also reduce their available time to&#xD;
      have a meaningful life. Carfilzomib is a drug used alone or in combination with other drugs&#xD;
      for treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma. It is gives as an intravenous infusion day 1 and&#xD;
      2, day 8 and 9, and day 15 and 16 every 28th day. Thus, the patients have to show up at the&#xD;
      hospital many times with the risk of acquiring infections. Likewise they sometimes live a&#xD;
      long way from the hospital, and therefore spent a lot of time on transportation to and from&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator wish to minimize the number of times the patients have to go to the&#xD;
      hospital, by educating them to self-administer day 2, 9 and 16 in their own home. The&#xD;
      investigator hope thereby to reduce their risk of hospital-acquired infections and to reduce&#xD;
      the time spent on transportation to and from treatment. From a hospital point of view the&#xD;
      investigator hope it will reduce the pressure on space in the outpatient clinic; that it will&#xD;
      reduce the time a nurse spent on treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present project, intravenous Carfilzomib is administered in the hospital through a&#xD;
      peripheral intravenous needle on day 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle and the treatment for the&#xD;
      day after is handed to the patient in a cooling compartment. The next day the patient will&#xD;
      load the Carfilzomib into the pump and attach it to the peripheral intravenous needle. Once&#xD;
      the infusion if finished, the patient will remove the needle and the following week, bring&#xD;
      the cooling compartment and the pump back to the hospital.&#xD;

      the cooling compartment and the pump back to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data concerning number of hospital visits, time spend on medication administration, and&#xD;
      transportation time will be collected from all 12 patients during cycle 3-4. The investigator&#xD;
      will also registered if the patients starts home treatment during cycle 2. In addition, to&#xD;
      further explore the patients and the health care professionals' experiences with home&#xD;
      treatment, a semi-structured interviews with the first five patients and possibly their&#xD;
      relatives, will be conducted once they have received at least 4 cycles. In addition, one&#xD;
      focus group interview of the healthcare professionals involved will be conducted once the&#xD;
      project have included and treated all 12 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data will be presented as counts and percentages for categorical data and as&#xD;
      mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile for continuous data. The qualitative&#xD;
      data will be analyzed via the method of condensation, in which the essence of the meanings of&#xD;
      the interviewees' statements is summarized and subdivided into themes and thereafter into&#xD;
      descriptive statements, so that the data is systematically reviewed and divided, and is then&#xD;
      able to form the basis for analysis&#xD;
