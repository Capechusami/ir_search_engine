    <textblock>
      This project will develop and test a wearable breathing monitor that will measure the&#xD;
      synchrony in breathing between the diaphragm and chest of children with a pain diagnosis&#xD;
      while receiving yoga therapy. Specifically, we will develop a biofeedback system to help&#xD;
      improve breathing in pain patients.&#xD;

      This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I application proposes the development&#xD;
      and trial of a novel non-invasive real-time breathing sensor - pneuRIP- to show the&#xD;
      beneficial effects of respiratory biofeedback on yoga. PneuRIP will be employed to monitor&#xD;
      and improve asana (posture) and pranayama (breathing) in yoga in youth with chronic pain. The&#xD;
      sensor consists of two inductive bands worn around the chest and abdomen that measure and&#xD;
      differentiate diaphragmatic and chest breathing through Respiratory Inductance&#xD;
      Plethysmography (RIP). Readings are recorded and analyzed on a small chest-worn unit and&#xD;
      wirelessly transmitted to an iPad. Measures include the phase angle between the chest and&#xD;
      abdomen; percentage breathing through the ribcage; respiratory rate; and labored breathing&#xD;
      index. This sensor takes little time to set up and readings are provided instantaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the proposal will develop the biofeedback software. The biofeedback&#xD;
      component will be related to the synchrony between diaphragmatic and chest breathing, and the&#xD;
      relative depth of breathing. This information will be presented to the user visually on an&#xD;
      iPad screen in the form of 2 moving bars - one corresponding to the chest and one to the&#xD;
      belly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of the study, we will test the pneuRIP with biofeedback with 20 youth with&#xD;
      pain enrolled in an interdisciplinary pediatric chronic pain program in a large pediatric&#xD;
      hospital receiving yoga as one of the therapies. The yoga regimen is 8 sessions, once per&#xD;
      week. Subjects will be randomized into two groups: one receiving instruction only on&#xD;
      synchronous breathing; the second group will receive biofeedback in addition. Outcomes will&#xD;
      be standardized measures of pain (recorded before and after entire regimen) and breathing&#xD;
      indices (recorded during each session). Outcomes will inform the feasibility of using&#xD;
      real-time biofeedback in yoga with a non-invasive respiratory monitor.&#xD;
