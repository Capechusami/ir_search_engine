  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a national observational, non-randomised, multicentre study, conducted in&#xD;
      France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited in routine clinical practice by office- or hospital-based urology&#xD;
      and/or oncology specialists when a first line treatment for their castrate resistant prostate&#xD;
      cancer is initiated. The decision to treat patients with either agent preceding study&#xD;
      enrolment will be left to the investigator's decision, per routine clinical practice. The&#xD;
      nature of treatment and clinical care of patients will not be influenced by their&#xD;
      participation in the study. All patients meeting the study criteria who visit the study&#xD;
      physician will be consecutively invited to participate in the study to minimise recruitment&#xD;
      bias. All medications administered will be collected. This is a non-interventional study. The&#xD;
      investigators are free to choose products, and modalities of administration in accordance&#xD;
      with the local Summary of Product Characteristics Therefore, the decision to prescribe one of&#xD;
      these therapies must be made prior to and independently from the decision to enrol patients&#xD;
      in this non interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential DDI will be identified using electronic screening methods (Micromedex Software and&#xD;
      Theriaque Software).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This design will enable assessment of treatment and subsequent outcomes based on local&#xD;
      standards, and is likely to encompass a wider range of therapeutic decisions compared with&#xD;
      the stricter, defined limits on therapy required by investigational study protocols.&#xD;
      Decisions and outcomes made in real-world conditions are likely to be more widely applicable&#xD;
      to clinical practice than those from interventional studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following French regulation there is no need for an approval of ethic committee for this type&#xD;
      of observational study.&#xD;

          -  Initiation of first- line systemic therapy (with abiraterone, apalutamide,&#xD;
             darolutamide, docetaxel or enzalutamide) for a non metastatic castrate-resistant or a&#xD;
             metastatic castrate naïve prostate cancer according to the approved labels and current&#xD;
