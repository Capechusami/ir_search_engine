    <textblock>
      This observational study evaluates the concentration of immune protein S100A8/A9 in different&#xD;
      liver failure syndromes, its interaction with the immune system and validity as an&#xD;
      immunotherapeutic target to improve survival in patients with advanced cirrhosis and/or acute&#xD;
      on chronic liver failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A paradox exists in chronic liver disease whereby there is a general recognition that chronic&#xD;
      inflammation is part of the pathophysiology, heightened when there is an acute deterioration&#xD;
      and organ failure (acute-on-chronic liver failure), yet there is an increased susceptibility&#xD;
      to infection due to a dysfunctional immune system, which is often the trigger for organ&#xD;
      failure and the reason for death in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A danger signal reported in other inflammatory conditions called S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) is&#xD;
      known to activate the immune system by production of pro-inflammatory cytokines but has also&#xD;
      been observed to promote the development immunosuppressive signals (e.g. IL-10 and MDSCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an attempt to explain this paradox in liver disease, this study proposes to identify at&#xD;
      the cellular and molecular level, the triggers for S100A8/A9 production, how it varies with&#xD;
      time in stable patients and those that have acute deteriorations including the development of&#xD;
      organ failure, and its interaction with innate immune cells in the circulation and at tissue&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By studying this, the Investigators hope to be able to identify immunotherapeutic targets and&#xD;
      understand whether potential immunotherapy could be applied locally or systemically. The&#xD;
      Investigators' observations in this study could provide the basis for the future development&#xD;
      of clinical immunomodulating agents, which may ameliorate immunopathology, reduce&#xD;
      susceptibility to infection and could reduce mortality in critically ill patients with liver&#xD;
      disease. Findings in this study may also have more generalizable impact especially with the&#xD;
      recent recognition in the COVID-19 pandemic that immunomodulatory therapies may improve the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes of inflammatory phenotypes in virus-induced severe sepsis.&#xD;

    <description>The study will evaluate whether S100A8/A9 concentration can be used to predict clinical outcomes, such as mortality, the development of infection and/or organ failure. In the laboratory, it will evaluate the effect S100A8/A9 has on immune functional readouts including phagocytosis, oxidative burst and cytokine production, all of which are required for an effect immune response. Similarly, by blocking its action, the study will identify whether this is a potential immunotherapeutic strategy to improve the outcome of patients with high concentrations of the protein.</description>
