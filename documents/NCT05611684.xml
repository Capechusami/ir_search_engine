      The effect of polyethylene glycol Losenatide on body fat, insulin resistance, weight, blood&#xD;
      sugar, blood lipid, stomach volume and other factors in patients with type 2 diabetes through&#xD;
      12 week follow-up, and explore the factors affecting the efficacy, so as to provide more&#xD;
      evidence-based medical basis for drug treatment and benefit patients.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to investigate the factors influencing the efficacy of 12 week&#xD;
      treatment with polyethylene glycol Losenatide in type 2 diabetes patients on the basis of&#xD;
      diet and exercise. With the 12 week decrease of HbA1c&lt;0.4% from the baseline as the cut-off&#xD;
      value, the patients were divided into HbA1c decrease&lt;0.4% group and HbA1c decrease ≥ 0.4%&#xD;
      group. The clinical characteristics, laboratory indicators, blood glucose fluctuation of&#xD;
      subgroups and gene spectrum differences between the groups were analyzed to provide reference&#xD;
      for clinical accurate drug use.&#xD;
