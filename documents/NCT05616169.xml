  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Easy Flype Carbostent™ is a CE-marked nitinol self-expanding stent for superficial&#xD;
      femoral artery (SFA) and Easy HiFlype Carbostent™is a CE-marked nitinol self-expanding stent&#xD;
      for iliac vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this post-market retrospective study protocl P42201 is to collect clinical data of&#xD;
      patients treated with Easy Flype or Easy Hi Flype for the stenosis or occlusion of the iliac&#xD;
      artery, femoral artery and first third of the popliteal artery in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to obtain long-term follow-up data, the data collection will be limited to patients&#xD;
      that have been treated with these devices at least 12 months prior to the study start.&#xD;

      The objective of this post-market study is to systematically collect retrospective clinical&#xD;
      data on the implantable medical devices EasyFlype/EasyHiFlype in the daily clinical practice&#xD;
      in an unselected population treated within the intended use. Data will be collected via&#xD;
      medical chart review in anonymous form to assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      EasyFlype/EasyHiFlype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Easy Flype Carbostent™ is a CE-marked nitinol self-expanding stent for superficial&#xD;
      femoral artery (SFA) and Easy HiFlype Carbostent™is a CE-marked nitinol self-expanding stent&#xD;
      for iliac vessels.&#xD;
