    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy of different modalities and frequencies of physical exercise on&#xD;
      glycaemic control in adults with prediabetes. Methods: four-arm, parallel, randomised,&#xD;
      controlled, clinical trial, with a total of 120 participants. A total of 90 participants will&#xD;
      be randomized in three arms: 1) aerobic exercise, 2) aerobic exercise combined with&#xD;
      resistance, and 3) high-intensity intervallic exercise. Moreover, a control group (n=30) will&#xD;
      be included to evaluate the effect of any type of intervention versus no intervention. Data&#xD;
      collection will be performed at baseline and 15-week of follow-up. Socio-demographic data,&#xD;
      medication, comorbidity, blood biochemical parameters, blood pressure, anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements, body composition, physical activity, sedentary lifestyle, diet, smoking,&#xD;
      alcohol consumption, quality of life and sleep questionnaires will be collected. The main&#xD;
      dependent variable will be the decrease of fasting plasma glucose. Moreover, a subsample of&#xD;
      participants (n=40) will were an accelerometer and a continuous glycaemia monitoring during 7&#xD;
      days, in 2 time points. The impact of the interventions on health will be also evaluated&#xD;
      through gene expression analysis in peripheral blood cells, widely used in clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      in the same subsample. Discussion: The results of this study will contribute to improving&#xD;
      physical exercise prescriptions for diabetes prevention, as well as a better understanding of&#xD;
      the response of glucose mechanisms to physical exercise in a population with prediabetes.&#xD;
      Increasing glycaemic control in people with prediabetes through physical exercise offers an&#xD;
      opportunity to prevent diabetes and reduce associated comorbidities and health costs.&#xD;

      Principal Aim. The main aim of the preset study is to compare the efficacy of 3 modalities of&#xD;
      physical exercise on fasting plasma glucose in adults with prediabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim. The secondary aims are to evaluate the effect of different physical exercise&#xD;
      modalities on the following variables: glycaemic variability measured continuously (24h),&#xD;
      normalization of glycaemic values (reversal), body mass index (BMI), body composition&#xD;
      (percentage and grams of total fat mass and muscle mass; visceral adipose tissue (VAT) waist&#xD;
      circumference, lipid profile, inflammation markers, blood pressure and sleep duration and&#xD;
      quality; transcriptomic markers of metabolic health assessed in peripheral blood cells (PBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GLYCEX study (GLYcaemic Control with EXercise) is a randomised, parallel, phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial with four arms and a duration of 15 weeks. The intervention groups will&#xD;
      receive an exercise intervention for 15 weeks, and control group will receive general&#xD;
      recommendations of PA, based on world health organization (WHO) recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study interventions were reported using the Template for Intervention Description and&#xD;
      Replication (TIDieR). The present protocol was elaborated following the Standard Protocol&#xD;
      Items: Recommendations for Intervention Trials (SPIRIT) 2013 State-ment. Reporting of the&#xD;
      study will follow the CONSORT statement recommendations on RCTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' identification and recruitment will be carried out at different primary care&#xD;
      centres that formally agreed to participate in this phase, and through posters distributed at&#xD;
      different points of interest: hospitals, universities, primary care centers, patient&#xD;
      associations, etc. Likewise, it will also be disseminated through social networks, such as&#xD;
      Twitter. Interested patients will receive the information sheet, sign the written informed&#xD;
      consent and eligibility criteria will be verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Adults aged 18-65 years, with overweight (BMI &gt;25 and &lt;35 Kg/m2),&#xD;
      inactive (&lt;150 min PA/week) and with prediabetes (fasting blood glucose 100-126 mg/dl) from&#xD;
      primary care services in Mallorca, and who have signed the informed consent will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: People with uncontrolled hypertension, diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D)&#xD;
      or oral antidiabetic prescription, active cancer, terminal illness or cognitive impairment,&#xD;
      pregnancy, cardiovascular disease, inability to perform moderate-vigorous physical exercise&#xD;
      for the next 3 months, major surgery or hospital admission in the last 3 months,&#xD;
      haematological disease that interferes with HbA1c determination, presence of any condition&#xD;
      (medical, psychological, social or geographical) current or anticipated that limits&#xD;
      participation in the study, or participation in another clinical trial will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be designed and implemented by a sports science professional. All&#xD;
      groups will perform a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate physical exercise per week or a&#xD;
      minimum of 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week, always performed under the supervision&#xD;
      of a sports science professional. During the intervention participants will progress to 300&#xD;
      minutes of moderate physical activity (PA) or 150 of vigorous PA. Prior to the start of the&#xD;
      full intervention, participants will undergo a 3-week pre-intervention physical conditioning.&#xD;
      Each intervention will last 12 weeks. Before starting the intervention program, participants&#xD;
      would be referred to a physician for medical testing and clearance. During all physical&#xD;
      exercise sessions, participants will wear a heart rate (HR) device that will relay their HR&#xD;
      to a laptop, from which the sports scientist will be able to control the intensity of the&#xD;
      session. The heart rate monitor model to be used is the Polar OH1, which has been validated&#xD;
      in previous studies. Polar HR monitors have demonstrated a high level of agreement with the&#xD;
      electrocardiogram and can therefore be used as a valid measure of HR in both laboratory and&#xD;
      field studies to measure HR during moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three exercise modalities will be compared: 1) Aerobic training (AT), 2) AT combined with&#xD;
      resistance training (RT) and 3) High intensive interval training (HIIT). During all&#xD;
      intervention sessions, participants will wear a HR monitor connected to a computer. In this&#xD;
      way, study staff will be able to control the intensity of the session and individualise&#xD;
      exercise prescriptions in real time. Heart rate monitoring will be a key element in ensuring&#xD;
      that each exercise is performed at the target intensity, by calculating the intensity at&#xD;
      which each volunteer performs the exercise based on a percentage of their HR. Despite there&#xD;
      are numerous formulas for estimating the maximum heart ratio (HRmax), studies based on&#xD;
      meta-analysis reported that [HRmax = 208 - 0.7 Ã— age] is a more reliable option to predict&#xD;
      HRmax. Once the HRmax has been estimated, the Karvonen formula will be used to calculate the&#xD;
      HR corresponding to a given percentage of intensity, for example, if we want a subject to&#xD;
      exercise at 60% of their HRmax, it will be calculated using the Karvonen formula, which takes&#xD;
      into account HRmax and basal heart rate (HRB), and is as follows: (HRB + % intensity desired&#xD;
      [HRmax - HRB]). This formula has been recommended for both, people with cardiac diseases and&#xD;
      athletes due to the accurate characteristics of the formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Aerobic Training intervention (AT): Perform 50 minutes/day, 3 days/week, totalling 150&#xD;
           min/week at moderate intensity, as recommended by WHO, in a range of 65-75% HRMax. Due&#xD;
           to any form of aerobic exercise involving large muscle groups and causes sustained&#xD;
           increases in HR is likely to be beneficial, the type of aerobic exercise will be agreed&#xD;
           with each group of patients, varying from 4 to 8 people. There will be a choice of&#xD;
           exercises and participants will be able to choose a combination of up to 2 different&#xD;
           exercises. The participants' choice of the type of activity to be performed is expected&#xD;
           to en-courage greater adherence. The range of exercises will be brisk walking or&#xD;
           running, swimming, and/or aerobic dancing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aerobic Training plus Resistance Training intervention (AT+RT): Perform 50 minutes/day,&#xD;
           3 days/week, starting with 50% of 1-repetition maximum (1-RM) and follow a progression&#xD;
           of increasing loads up to 75% of 1-RM for optimal gains in strength and insulin action.&#xD;
           In each session, between 5 and 10 exercises will be worked on, performing 10-15&#xD;
           repetitions, and progressing to 8-10 lifting as the weight increases, involving the&#xD;
           major muscle groups from the core, lower body and upper body. In all sessions there will&#xD;
           be a 3-minute warm-up at the beginning of the session and a 2-minute cool-down at the&#xD;
           end of the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. High Intensive Interval Training intervention (HIIT): To be considered high intensive&#xD;
           the heart rate needs to be above â‰¥85% . Perform 25 minutes/day, 3 days/week, totalling&#xD;
           75 min/week at a vigorous intensity, as recommended by WHO. Starting with 4 intervals&#xD;
           lasting 1 minute keeping in a range of 85-90% HRMax, separated by 1 minute of low&#xD;
           intensity activity (no static) (4 Ã— 1 min intervals.) A progression will be followed by&#xD;
           increasing the number of circuits, up to 10 (10 Ã— 1 min intervals). In all sessions&#xD;
           there will be a 3-minute warm-up at the beginning of the session and a 2-minute&#xD;
           cool-down at the end of the session. Although the target population is a sedentary&#xD;
           population, we expect the HIIT approach, despite being high intensity, to be well&#xD;
           received, due to its growing popularity, as demonstrated by a study in which 62% of&#xD;
           inactive participants preferred HIIT to other types of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the control group will receive written standard PA recommendations in this&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main dependent variable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable is the change in FPG at 15 weeks of follow-up. Secondary&#xD;
      dependent variables: glycaemic variability, HbA1c, TG, blood pressure, body composition,&#xD;
      waist circumference, transcriptomic biomarkers in blood and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main independent variable The main independent variable is the assigned group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analyses will be performed using R v3.3.1 and Stata v17.0&#xD;
      program. P-values &lt;0.05 will be deemed statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive analysis, labelling and data cleaning: Assessment of outliers and extreme&#xD;
           values, detection and labelling of missing and/or non-applicable values, and description&#xD;
           of the distribution of each of the variables. Normality test and scatter plots.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptive baseline analysis: Sociodemographic characteristics and FPG and continuous&#xD;
           blood glucose values by the 3 intervention modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Main analysis: This will be differentiated for each of the phases and will be done by&#xD;
           intention-to-treat and per protocol analysis. A comparison of the decrease in FPG and&#xD;
           glycaemic variability between the 3 modalities will be made. The ANOVA test will be used&#xD;
           for both phases. If the assumptions of normality are not met, the Kruskal-Wallis test&#xD;
           will be applied. A crude analysis, or adjusted for baseline characteristics if&#xD;
           necessary, will be performed using general linear models (GLM) to determine the effect&#xD;
           of membership in each exercise group on decreasing FPG and glycaemic variability values.&#xD;
           A similar analysis will be performed for each of the secondary dependent variables&#xD;
           (HbA1c, TG, blood pressure, body composition, waist circumference and quality of life).&#xD;
