    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the diagnostic potential of Artificial&#xD;
      Intelligence-assisted Fecal Microbiome Testing for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease. The main question it aims to answer is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Is Artificial Intelligence-assisted Fecal Microbiome Testing a reliable screening test for&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to provide fecal samples to be analyzed with next-generation&#xD;
      sequencing techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is a comparison group: Researchers will compare the diagnostic performance of&#xD;
      AI-assisted Fecal Microbiome Testing with colonoscopy to see the correlation between the&#xD;
      results of both interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a&#xD;
      chronic and complex disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that affects millions of people&#xD;
      worldwide. IBD is typically diagnosed through a combination of patient history, physical&#xD;
      examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. However, these methods can be expensive,&#xD;
      invasive, and time-consuming, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research has focused on the potential of using fecal microbiome testing, which&#xD;
      analyzes the composition and function of the gut microbiota, as a non-invasive and&#xD;
      cost-effective screening tool for IBD. The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem of&#xD;
      microorganisms that plays a critical role in maintaining gut health and immune system&#xD;
      function. Changes in the composition or function of the gut microbiota have been associated&#xD;
      with the development and progression of IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can assist in the analysis of fecal microbiome&#xD;
      testing data and provide a more accurate and reliable diagnosis of IBD. AI can identify&#xD;
      patterns and trends in the complex data generated by microbiome testing that may not be&#xD;
      apparent to human analysts, leading to earlier and more accurate diagnosis of IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, AI can help identify potential biomarkers of IBD, which could be used for&#xD;
      screening and monitoring disease activity. These biomarkers could provide insights into the&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms of IBD, leading to the development of more effective therapies and&#xD;
      personalized treatment approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the use of AI-assisted fecal microbiome testing for IBD screening holds significant&#xD;
      potential for improving the diagnosis and management of this chronic and debilitating&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
