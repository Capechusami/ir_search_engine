  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, refugees and asylum seekers suffer at high rates from trauma and stress-related&#xD;
      mental health problems. The research group therefore developed, and initially piloted in a&#xD;
      single-site open trial, a novel mindfulness- and compassion-based digital intervention&#xD;
      program - Mindfulness-SOS for refugees (Mindfulness-SOS). The pilot study had promising&#xD;
      preliminary findings of utilization, feasibility and related dose-response effects of&#xD;
      intervention program engagement with mental health outcomes. The digital intervention program&#xD;
      was developed based on randomized control trial data of a group-based mindfulness- and&#xD;
      compassion-based program for forcibly displaced people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address common limitations of mobile health interventions such as attrition, engagement&#xD;
      and adherence, the investigators will implement a personalized stepped-care adaptation and&#xD;
      augmentation of Mindfulness-SOS, that entails providing intensified (remote) guidance for&#xD;
      FDPs that do not respond to the intervention, to optimize capacity to therapeutically benefit&#xD;
      from Mindfulness-SOS. To do so, the investigators propose to carry out a randomized&#xD;
      controlled Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) study to test and optimize&#xD;
      the therapeutic outcomes of Mindfulness-SOS, using an adaptive intervention sequence of&#xD;
      guidance format intensities among N ≅ 170 (50% female) adult trauma-affected Eritrean&#xD;
      asylum-seekers residing in Israel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 100 million Forcibly Displaced Persons (FDPs), including refugees and asylum-seekers,&#xD;
      are forcibly displaced due to conflict, persecution, and natural disaster. Forced&#xD;
      displacement is often associated with severe and chronic forms of trauma- and stress-related&#xD;
      mental health difficulties, with destructive generational and inter-generational consequences&#xD;
      for forcibly displaced families including spouses or partners, children, as well as&#xD;
      communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this fast-growing crisis and the public health challenge, field-wide efforts have&#xD;
      emerged to develop and test interventions tailored to the complex needs and post-displacement&#xD;
      settings of FDPs. Among such efforts, the research group developed Mindfulness-Based Trauma&#xD;
      Recovery for Refugees (MBTR-R) - a Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI) that is group-based,&#xD;
      trauma-sensitive and socio-culturally adapted for diverse populations of FDPs. MBTR-R&#xD;
      demonstrated waitlist-controlled evidence of efficacy and safety to improve stress- and&#xD;
      trauma-related mental health outcomes among African asylum-seekers in Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet, the potential reach, access, scalability, and therefore impact of such interventions is&#xD;
      systematically limited by their relatively rigid, group-based in-person delivery format.&#xD;
      Behavioral Intervention Technologies (BITs), notably via mobile health interventions&#xD;
      (mHealth), may be one promising implementation approach to help facilitate the dissemination&#xD;
      and scalability of MBTR-R among FDPs. The research group therefore developed, and initially&#xD;
      piloted a novel mHealth adaptation of MBTR-R - Mindfulness-SOS for refugees (Mindfulness-SOS)&#xD;
      with promising preliminary findings of utilization, related feasibility and effects of&#xD;
      engagement with the program on several individual mental health outcomes (i.e., modest&#xD;
      protective dose-response effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet, to improve their impact and efficacy, the development and delivery of BIT adaptations of&#xD;
      MBIs broadly, and among FDPs specifically, must address well-documented limitations of BITs,&#xD;
      most notably, high attrition, low engagement and adherence. One way to do so is through&#xD;
      personalized stepped-care adaptation and augmentation of Mindfulness-SOS, that entails&#xD;
      providing intensified (remote) guidance for FDPs that do not respond to the intervention, as&#xD;
      a means of reducing attrition, increasing engagement and adherence, and optimizing capacity&#xD;
      to therapeutically benefit from Mindfulness-SOS. The research group argues that a Sequential&#xD;
      Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART), a multistage randomized trials design, is&#xD;
      particularly well-suited to experimentally deliver, test, and optimize such a personalized&#xD;
      adaptive stepped-care approach to Mindfulness-SOS for FDPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research group therefore propose to carry out a SMART study to test and optimize the&#xD;
      therapeutic outcomes of Mindfulness-SOS, using an adaptive intervention sequence of guidance&#xD;
      format intensities among N ≅ 170 (50% female) adult Eritrean asylum-seekers residing in&#xD;
      Israel. Following baseline assessment (pre-intervention), participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to Minimally-Guided Mindfulness-SOS (MG-Mindfulness-SOS) or to Wait-List Control.&#xD;
      Mid-intervention, 3-weeks following randomization, all participants will be re-assessed.&#xD;
      Participants initially randomized to MG-Mindfulness-SOS will be identified as either&#xD;
      responders or non-responders. Responders will be assigned to continue MG-Mindfulness-SOS.&#xD;
      Non-responders will be re-randomized to either Intensified-Guidance Mindfulness-SOS&#xD;
      (IG-Mindfulness-SOS), an adaptive intervention sequence condition, or to continue with the&#xD;
      MG-Mindfulness-SOS, a non-adaptive intervention sequence condition. Following the 7-week&#xD;
      wait-list period and after re-assessment, Wait-List Control participants will initiate&#xD;
      MG-Mindfulness-SOS intervention, receive MG-Mindfulness-SOS. Then, like participants&#xD;
      initially randomized to MG-Mindfulness-SOS, 3-weeks following the wait-list period,&#xD;
      participants will be re-randomized to either Intensified-Guidance Mindfulness-SOS&#xD;
      (IG-Mindfulness-SOS), the adaptive intervention sequence condition, or to continue with the&#xD;
      MG-Mindfulness-SOS, the non-adaptive intervention sequence condition. All participants will&#xD;
      be re-assessed at post-intervention, and then at 8-week follow-up assessment. Primary&#xD;
      outcomes will include subjective self-report measures of individual mental health outcomes.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include subjective self-report and/or parental report measures of&#xD;
      pro-social family outcomes, child outcomes, inter-personal and community outcomes.&#xD;
