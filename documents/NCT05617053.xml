  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the results of directional atherectomy with&#xD;
      antirestenotic therapy (DAART technique) and angioplasty/Supera stenting for the treatment of&#xD;
      popliteal atherectomy lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atherectomy offers a way to improve the chances to avoid stent placement, although it did not&#xD;
      show superiority in terms of vessel patency or limb salvage compared with POBA. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      atherectomy can modify the plaque morphology and the mechanical properties of the baseline&#xD;
      disease, which allows better drug penetration and diffusion into the vessel wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the combination of directional atherectomy devices and drug coated balloons&#xD;
      (directional atherectomy with antirestenotic therapy, DAART), theoretically might further&#xD;
      improve the clinical outcomes of drug coated angioplasty. The &quot;leave nothing behind&quot;&#xD;
      strategies have gained support among interventionalist. Many studies claim that atherectomy&#xD;
      improves results when combined with adjunctive DCB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Supera stent, when compared with other self-expanding nitinol stents, has proven to&#xD;
      deforms less with knee flexion and exhibits less strain. It mimics the natura structure and&#xD;
      movement of the anatomy and optimizes luminal gain maintaining a round open lumen in&#xD;
      challenging anatomies, as the popliteal artery. Mechanical scaffolding is often required&#xD;
      owing to elastic recoil and flow-limiting dissections in complex popliteal lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose to this study was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy of both techniques for&#xD;
      endovascular treatment of atherosclerotic lesions of the popliteal artery.&#xD;
