      The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the use of TEAS on female patients with&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea. The main questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions 1：Effect of TEAS on dysmenorrhea Questions 2：Mechanism of TEAS in treatment of&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea Participants will wear TEAS devices to treat dysmenorrhea during menstruation&#xD;
      The participants in the control group were treated with oral medication for dysmenorrhea&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dysmenorrhea is a common female disease, with an incidence about 20-40% in female, affecting&#xD;
      the living quality of the patients. The treatment of dysmenorrhea usually includes hormone&#xD;
      drugs to suppress ovulation, and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to relieve pain,&#xD;
      but symptoms would relapse after drugs withdrawal. While long-term use of these drugs may&#xD;
      cause endocrine disorders, even affect the normal preparation of pregnancy. Recent studies&#xD;
      have shown that dysmenorrhea is related to many factors such as immune and neuroendocrine&#xD;
      changes. Transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS) is a new therapeutic method&#xD;
      derived from traditional acupuncture therapy. In this method, the electrode placed on the&#xD;
      surface of the skin of acupoints is used to guide the stimulating current into the body and&#xD;
      stimulate the acupoints to achieve the goal of treatment, and can effectively relieve the&#xD;
      pain of patients by replacing the traditional mechanical stimulation of hand-twisting&#xD;
      needles. The aim of this study is to treat dysmenorrhea in women with TEAS, and to observe&#xD;
      the therapeutic effect of TEAS, at the same time, prostaglandins, pain-related factors and&#xD;
      immune-related factors were detected in dysmenorrhea women before and after treatment to&#xD;
      study the mechanism.&#xD;
