  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open-label, study designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      preliminary anti-tumor activity of memory-like natural killer cells (ML NK) in combination&#xD;
      with nivolumab and relatlimab in subjects with advanced and/or metastatic melanoma. There&#xD;
      will be two arms to test the variables of ML NK cell source. ML NK cells from an autologous&#xD;
      source will be used for Arm 1, and ML NK cells from an allogenic source will be used for Arm&#xD;
      2. The investigators hypothesize that ML NK cells from either an autologous source or&#xD;
      allogenic source are safe and tolerable in subjects with advanced and/or metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
