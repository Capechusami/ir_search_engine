  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is defined as a velocity of fetal growth less than the&#xD;
      normal fetus growth potential for a specific neonate as per the race and gender. These&#xD;
      neonates face many acute problems during peripartum and after birth .The causes of IUGR may&#xD;
      be maternal, placental, fetal or genetic and also due to combination of any of these factors.&#xD;
      Knowledge of etiologies of fetal growth restriction (FGR) is essential, so that future care&#xD;
      can be targeted at prevention . It is apparent that FGR is primarily caused by placental&#xD;
      dysfunction (PIH&amp;PE), insufficiency that lead to reduced fetal growth overall. FGR is&#xD;
      associated with lifelong burden of chronic diseases including metabolic, respiratory,&#xD;
      cardiovascular and neurological deficits. Pre-eclampsia (PE) is diagnosed by the combined&#xD;
      presentation of high blood pressure and proteinuria. New definitions also include maternal&#xD;
      organ dysfunction, such as renal, liver, neurological or haematological complications,&#xD;
      uteroplacental dysfunction, or FGR . In an attempt to correct fetus reduced supply the&#xD;
      placenta release various cytokines and markers as Alpha-1 anti-trypsin (AAT). The Golgi&#xD;
      apparatus secretes this cytokine in placental cytotrophoblast and blood vessels. AAT is&#xD;
      antinflammatory antiprotease protective molecule. AAT rises during normal pregnancy. The&#xD;
      suboptimal rise of AAT in pregnancy are liable for increased obstetrical complications like&#xD;
      abortion, preterm labor. AAT levels were found decreased in placenta tissues from women with&#xD;
      PE compared that of healthy women. Although AAT deficiency is associated with several&#xD;
      pregnancy and placental disorders, little is known regarding AAT levels and PE .&#xD;
