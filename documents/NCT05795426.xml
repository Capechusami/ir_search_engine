      Kinesiophobia is a form of behavior that includes fear and anxiety in which the person tends&#xD;
      to stay away from the movement. . In the future, this may lead to a decrease in muscle&#xD;
      strength and condition, leading to loss or decrease in physical adequacy, avoidance of&#xD;
      exercise and, accordingly, psychological problems. Kinesiophobia also negatively affects the&#xD;
      success of the treatment process in athletes or normal patients.&#xD;

      In athletes, this situation affects the sports activity that they place at the center of&#xD;
      their lives, causing loss of performance and, accordingly, the emergence of psychological&#xD;
      problems. Athletes are faced with the deterioration of bone integrity during training or&#xD;
      matches according to their branches, or they are injured by structures such as muscles,&#xD;
      tendons and ligaments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the important criteria in pain, kinesiophobia and exercise is sleep quality. Results&#xD;
      such as sleep quality or increased stress level in insomnia and inattention may have an&#xD;
      effect on pain or kinesiophobia. The deterioration in sleep quality leads to a decrease in&#xD;
      the performance ability of the person, affecting the daily activity, decreasing the energy&#xD;
      level and being in a daytime sleepy state.&#xD;
