  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is to investigate a patient transfer path from the hospital to Hospital@Home&#xD;
      to their general practitioners (GPs) using telemedical procedures. Telemedical support will&#xD;
      be executed by Medgate who will refer the patients to their GPs after the telemedical&#xD;
      consultations are completed. Inclusion criteria is the need for short time follow up&#xD;
      procedures that can be handled by telemedicine. Throughout the study, patient and stakeholder&#xD;
      satisfaction will be measured and data-based methods will be developed to assess patient&#xD;
      transfer success. Overall, new information flow and communication between the stakeholders&#xD;
      (hospital, telemedicine and general practitioners) are defined and tested. The Hospital@Home&#xD;
      pilot study is intended to become a flagship project for new healthcare models.&#xD;

      This pilot study is to investigate a patient transfer path from the hospital to Hospital@Home&#xD;
      to their general practitioners (GPs) using telemedical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following study procedures are depicted:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (screening): Patients provide the name of their GP, the means of transport that they&#xD;
      usually take to him, demographic data, past medical history and current medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team contacts the GP afterwards by phone to get his/her consent. The study team&#xD;
      informs Medgate about the participant and the procedure. Next to that it will link Medgate&#xD;
      technically to the case of the patient that Medgate can see the patient's documentation in&#xD;
      the University Hospital Basel (USB) -ePortal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (transfer): Before leaving the hospital, the participant will be instructed by a&#xD;
      member of the study team on how and when to fill out the questionnaires. At this time, the&#xD;
      participant and the USB physician will answer the first one. After Medgate has received the&#xD;
      information from USB that the patient has been included in the study and has left the&#xD;
      hospital, the patient will be contacted by Medgate and the appointment for the first&#xD;
      teleconsultation will be made according to information from USB. The patient will be called&#xD;
      by Medgate physician at the agreed time and the teleconsultation will be performed. Depending&#xD;
      on the patient's condition and health status, further appointments are scheduled. The patient&#xD;
      has the possibility to contact Medgate at any time (24/7) in case of an urgent medical&#xD;
      matter. The patient receives the physician's recommendations in written form after each&#xD;
      teleconsultation as their treatment plan via app or e-mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3...x (telecare): In advance of the first consultation via Medgate, the Medgate&#xD;
      physician will log in into the USB-ePortal to get all important medical information about the&#xD;
      patient. After that consultation the patient and the Medgate physician will answer a&#xD;
      questionnaire. Depending on the clinical condition, health status and from this resulted&#xD;
      procedure, the participant will be contacted several times. After the last consultation the&#xD;
      Medgate physician will answer a questionnaire and will refer the patient back to the GP. The&#xD;
      documentation will be sent to the GP and the USB. The GP will get a questionnaire as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 (follow-up): On day x after the last consultation via Medgate the GP and the&#xD;
      participant will answer the last questionnaire.&#xD;

    <description>PROMS (patient-reported outcome measures survey): measure to asses a patient's quality of life affected by state of health. 6 standardized questions for self-assessment of the patient's state of health by the patient. The content of the questions relates to mobility, self-care, general activities, pain, anxiety and health in general. Questions are answered using Likert scales and qualitative free text answers. Scoring: 5 multiple choice questions (example pain: no pain, mild -, moderate -, severe -, extreme pain); (example general health: Scale from 0 - 100 (0 = worst health, 100 = best health imaginable)).</description>

    <description>The SPI shows the need for care in each patient. The SPI ranges from values between 0 - 40, whereas a low SPI corresponds to more extensive need for care. It is the numeric score outcome of the ePA-AC, which is calculated from 10 ePA-AC questions.</description>
