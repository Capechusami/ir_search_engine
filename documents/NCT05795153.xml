      The primary objective of the study is to rule out an increase of &gt;3mmHg in 24-hour average&#xD;
      Systolic Blood Pressure at steady state (Week 4) compared to baseline. ABPM was chosen for&#xD;
      the blood pressure assessment in this trial as recommended by the FDA for drugs intended for&#xD;
      chronic use (Assessment of Pressor Effects of Drugs Guidance for Industry (FDA 2022)).&#xD;

      The primary objective of the study is to rule out an increase of &gt;3mmHg in 24-hour average&#xD;
      Systolic Blood Pressure at steady state (Week 4) compared to baseline. ABPM was chosen for&#xD;
      the blood pressure assessment in this trial as recommended by the FDA for drugs intended for&#xD;
      chronic use (Assessment of Pressor Effects of Drugs Guidance for Industry (FDA 2022)). It&#xD;
      allows the observation over a 24-hour period and the measure of an individual's blood&#xD;
      pressure throughout an entire day. This ABPM study will be performed in a patient population&#xD;
      similar to the ongoing Phase 3 studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration will be up to 20 weeks. The treatment duration will be up to 12 weeks and&#xD;
      the visit frequency will be once every 4 weeks with additional 2 visits for application of&#xD;
      the ABPM device before baseline and Week 4 visits.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Signed informed consent must be obtained prior to participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male and female adult participants ≥18 years of age at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. CSU duration for ≥ 6 months prior to screening (defined as the onset of CSU determined&#xD;
             by the investigator based on all available supporting documentation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Diagnosis of CSU inadequately controlled by second generation H1-AH at the time of&#xD;
             baseline (Day 1) defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The presence of itch and hives for ≥6 consecutive weeks prior to screening&#xD;
                  despite the use of second generation H1-AH during this time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  UAS7 score (range 0-42) ≥16, ISS7 score (range 0-21) ≥ 6 and HSS7 score (range&#xD;
                  0-21) ≥ 6 during the 7 days prior to baseline (Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Documentation of hives within three months before baseline (either at screening and/or&#xD;
             at baseline (Day 1); or documented in the participants' medical history).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing and able to complete an Urticaria Patient Daily Diary (UPDD) for the duration&#xD;
             of the study and adhere to the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participants must not have had more than two missing UPDD entry (either morning or&#xD;
             evening) in the 7 days prior to baseline (Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Use of other investigational drugs within 5 half-lives or within 30 days (for small&#xD;
             molecules) prior to Screening or until the expected pharmacodynamic (PD) effect has&#xD;
             returned to baseline (for biologics), whichever is longer; or longer if required by&#xD;
             local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previous use of remibrutinib or other BTK inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of hypersensitivity to any of the study treatments or its excipients or to&#xD;
             drugs of similar chemical classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants having a clearly defined predominant or sole trigger of their chronic&#xD;
             urticaria (chronic inducible urticaria) including urticaria factitia (symptomatic&#xD;
             dermographism), cold-, heat-, solar-, pressure-, delayed pressure-, aquagenic-,&#xD;
             cholinergic-, or contact-urticaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ongoing or past history of hypertension and/or SBP ≥140 or ≤90 and/or DBP ≥90 or ≤60&#xD;
             mmHg at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participants unable to tolerate 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement prior to&#xD;
             baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participants with an arm circumference greater than 50cm.&#xD;
