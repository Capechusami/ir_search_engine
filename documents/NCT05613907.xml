  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CLTI is the most severe form of peripheral arterial disease. Patients with the condition&#xD;
      require investigation and management (typically in the form of revascularisation surgery) to&#xD;
      salvage the limb. Traditionally, patients with the condition are admitted into hospital for&#xD;
      their management, but with the advent of regional vascular networks, this is becoming&#xD;
      increasingly difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland have advocated for the use of&#xD;
      dedicated CLTI clinics to overcome this problem. Whilst there is burgeoning evidence for&#xD;
      their clinical benefit, there is a lack of patient reported outcomes to measure their impact&#xD;
      on patient selr-reported quality of life. We would like to determine if this service benefits&#xD;
      its users as much as the clinical outcomes suggest it does.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI) is the most severe form of peripheral arterial&#xD;
      disease (PAD). It affects 1% of the population and its incidence is expected to rise. It is a&#xD;
      condition where the circulation to one, or both limbs is inadequate. It requires&#xD;
      investigation and may require surgery in order to improve the blood flow to the affected&#xD;
      limb(s). Without improvement in circulation, ulcers and gangrene set in, and the only cure is&#xD;
      a major limb amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular surgery units in the United Kingdom have undergone centralisation into regional&#xD;
      networks over the last decade in order to consolidate vascular surgery into 'high volume&#xD;
      centres' to provide high quality care and better outcomes for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, national analysis of the performance of units has demonstrated that only 50% of CLTI&#xD;
      patients are revascularised within the 'deliberately-challenging timeline' issued by the&#xD;
      Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland (Birmpili et al., 2021; Vascular Society of&#xD;
      Great Britain and Ireland, 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLTI already comprises more than 50% of vascular unit workload and the prevalence of CLTI is&#xD;
      expected to rise, further increasing the burden on vascular services (Fowkes et al., 2016;&#xD;
      Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 2018, 2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is ample evidence demonstrating a strong inverse correlation between the provision of&#xD;
      specialist outpatient clinics in the assessment and management of diabetic foot ulcers and&#xD;
      major lower limb amputation (Joret et al., 2019; M Kerr, Rayman, &amp; Jeffcoate, 2014; Marion&#xD;
      Kerr, 2017; Monteiro-soares, Vale-lima, Martiniano, Dias, &amp; Boyko, 2021; Paisey et al.,&#xD;
      2017), Diabetic foot ulceration is a condition which has significant overlap with CLTI. It&#xD;
      could therefore be inferred that a similar service for CLTI patients would also confer the&#xD;
      same benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Leeds Vascular Institute, we have implemented a dedicated CLTI clinic to assess and&#xD;
      manage patients with the condition. Whilst there is limited evidence that these rapid access&#xD;
      clinics can facilitate review and management of the condition, thereby successfully&#xD;
      preventing major amputation in CLTI patients, the results are typically from single centre&#xD;
      data series (Khan et al., 2020; Nickinson et al., 2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a paucity of evidence evaluating patient opinions of this type of service and non&#xD;
      that demonstrate any impact on their quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>A statistically significant change in the self reported quality of life scores pre- and post-CLTI clinic assessment and management, using the EuroQoL-5D questionnaire. The EuroQoL 5-D questionnaire contains 4 questions which have 5 answers each ranging from no symptoms to severe symptoms. The final question is on a scale ranging from 0-100 where 0 is the worst possible response and 100 is the best possible response</description>

        The study population is made up of opportunistic patients obtained from the CLTI clinic&#xD;
        attendance register. They have been referred to the service either because they have a&#xD;
        confirmed diagnosis of CLTI and need further management or the disease is suspected.&#xD;
        Patients who do not have CLTI will be excluded as will those who do not have the ability to&#xD;
