  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive daytime sleepiness which still remains after an effective treatment with nocturnal&#xD;
      ventilotherapy or with other specific treatments (positional therapy, oro-mandibular devices)&#xD;
      in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome has a prevalence of 55% of treated cases,&#xD;
      representing a notable theme of clinical and research interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years there have been several studies on the use of wakefulness-promoting drugs&#xD;
      generally prescribed in patients with narcolepsy, in this disorder with promising results.&#xD;
      Right in consideration of the forthcoming approval of these drugs, it is important to find&#xD;
      biomarkers able to predict which patients will develop daytime sleepiness resistant to&#xD;
      ventilatory treatment. Several studies have highlighted the association between obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea syndrome and the increase of cerebral amyloid beta deposits, concluding that&#xD;
      apnoic disorder can be considered a risk factor for the development of cognitive impairment&#xD;
      and Alzheimer';s disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this scenario, it would be useful to identify biological markers able to underline which&#xD;
      clinical phenotypes of sleep apnea syndrome are more associated with residual excessive&#xD;
      daytime sleepiness and/or cognitive impairment. In recent years several kits for the assay of&#xD;
      biomarkers of neurodegeneration have been developed not only in CSF, but also in human serum.&#xD;
      Among them, the most important are light chain neurofilaments (NFL), amyloid isoforms 40 and&#xD;
      42 (Ab40 and Ab42). Other biomarkers found in neurodegenerative diseases associated with&#xD;
      excessive daytime sleepiness are orexin A (OXA) and histamine (HA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this view, the aim of this study is to evaluate the role of biomarkers of&#xD;
      neurodegeneration in characterizing disease severity and response to treatment of obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea syndrome with residual excessive daytime sleepiness.&#xD;
