      Comparison of kinematic movements between patients with anterior cruciate ligament rupture&#xD;
      and post-operative patients and normal people using a mobile dynamic X-ray device.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On a treadmill equipped with a mobile dynamic X-ray device, the subject will take three&#xD;
      movements: walking, downhill walking, and squat, and the movement of the knee joint will be&#xD;
      tracked. The investigators plan to quantify and compare the motion of the knee joint taken in&#xD;
      patients with anterior cruciate ligament rupture, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,&#xD;
      and normal people according to 6 degrees of freedom. Through this, the investigators plan to&#xD;
      compare the functional instability between normal people and the ACL rupture patient group in&#xD;
      daily life, and compare this with the ACL reconstruction patient group to see if surgery can&#xD;
      reduce knee joint instability in everyday life. To confirm this, with mobile dynamic X-rays&#xD;
      taken as the primary variable, the investigators took 1) normal subjects, 2) patients with&#xD;
      anterior cruciate ligament rupture, 3) patients with more than 1 year after double bundle ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction, and 4) single bundle anterior patients. the investigators plan to compare 6&#xD;
      degrees of freedom between patient groups who have had more than 1 year after cruciate&#xD;
      ligament reconstruction and anterolateral ligament reconstruction. As secondary variables,&#xD;
      the Lachman test and the Pivot shift test will be compared between the four groups.&#xD;
