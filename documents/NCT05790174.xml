  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the effect of an existing hospital-based obesity treatment in&#xD;
      children and adolescents in relation to weight loss and motivation. This is to ensure that&#xD;
      children who have developed obesity have the possibility to obtain a healthier lifestyle,&#xD;
      including a healthier body weight during their school years. This study will test whether an&#xD;
      obesity treatment program designed for school children can reduce the degree of overweight in&#xD;
      children and adolescents with overweight and obesity.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in BMI during weight-loss program of childhood overweight and obesity</measure>
    <time_frame>December 2022 - December 2025</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is to investigate the changes in BMI z-score among children and adolescents with overweight or obesity who participated in a hospital-based weight-loss program, and whether existing characteristics of the child and parents at baseline modify this association. In addition we also want to characterize those who do not respond to treatment either because they gain or regain BMI z-score, or drop-out of the weight-loss program.</description>

    <intervention_name>ROS &quot;chubby and healthy&quot; - a multidisciplinary family-based weight-loss treatment program</intervention_name>
    <description>The weight-loss treatment program &quot;ROS&quot; is family-based and delivered by a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, dieticians, and psychologists. The treatment is based on an individualized tailored plan made together with the family. The plan consists of dietary changes, more physical activity, regular weight checks, and motivational conversations. The program includes options of cooking classes, group session with a psychologist and participation in structured physical activity called &quot;ROS sports&quot; twice a week. Follow up visits are scheduled every 2-3 months at the different health care professionals.</description>
