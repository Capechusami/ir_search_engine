  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single center study evaluating the performance of an externally worn sound processor for a&#xD;
      transcutaneous bone anchored hearing system using audiological outcomes measures such as&#xD;
      aided thresholds and self-evaluation questionnaires.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone conduction hearing systems use the body's natural ability to transfer sound through bone&#xD;
      conduction. The sound processor picks up sound and converts it into vibrations that are&#xD;
      transferred through the skull bone to the inner ear (cochlea). Thus, for patients with&#xD;
      conductive or mixed hearing losses, patients with lasting hearing loss following a middle ear&#xD;
      disease or malformations (such as microtia), the vibrations are bypassing the conductive&#xD;
      problem in the ear canal or middle ear. Bone conduction devices currently on the market are&#xD;
      divided into three types; transcutaneous direct drive, percutaneous (skin penetrating) direct&#xD;
      drive and transcutaneous skin drive bone conduction devices. This evaluation focus on a sound&#xD;
      processor used for a transcutaneous system.&#xD;
