  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting approximately 10% of&#xD;
      individuals aged ≥ 65. Most available treatments aim at controlling symptoms at an early&#xD;
      stage rather than providing a cure. Therefore, an accurate and early diagnosis of AD with&#xD;
      appropriate management will slow the progression of the condition. Reduced cerebral glucose&#xD;
      levels have been observed in patients with early AD. Glucose hypometabolism can be assessed&#xD;
      by administering a radioactive glucose analogue, 2-deoxy-2-(18F) fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG),&#xD;
      and imaging with PET (positron emission tomography). The high cost and limited availability&#xD;
      of PET-CT (PET - computed tomography) still hamper its general clinical application.&#xD;
      Moreover, the use of radioactive tracers in combination with the additional ionizing&#xD;
      radiation of CT is not suitable for repeated measurements. Therefore, currently, the&#xD;
      provisional diagnosis of AD is still based on the combination of clinical history,&#xD;
      neurological examination, cognitive testing over a period of time, and structural&#xD;
      neuroimaging. This has major time and resource implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A radically different and highly innovative means for imaging glucose with magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) has now been established, exploiting the interaction between hydroxyl protons&#xD;
      in glucose and the protons in water; the method is termed glucose Chemical Exchange&#xD;
      Saturation Transfer (glucoCEST). GlucoCEST MRI is a method that has no reliance on&#xD;
      radiolabelled glucose analogues and could become widely implemented in clinic practice. We&#xD;
      therefore aim to investigate the potential of glucoCEST MRI in Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting approximately 10% of&#xD;
      individuals aged ≥ 65. Most available treatments aim at controlling symptoms at an early&#xD;
      stage rather than providing a cure. Therefore, an accurate and early diagnosis of AD with&#xD;
      appropriate management will slow the progression of the condition. Reduced cerebral glucose&#xD;
      levels have been observed in patients with early AD. Glucose hypometabolism can be assessed&#xD;
      by administering a radioactive glucose analogue, 2-deoxy-2-(18F) fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG),&#xD;
      and imaging with PET (positron emission tomography). The high cost and limited availability&#xD;
      of PET-CT (PET - computed tomography) still hamper its general clinical application.&#xD;
      Moreover, the use of radioactive tracers in combination with the additional ionizing&#xD;
      radiation of CT is not suitable for repeated measurements. Therefore, currently, the&#xD;
      provisional diagnosis of AD is still based on the combination of clinical history,&#xD;
      neurological examination, cognitive testing over a period of time, and structural&#xD;
      neuroimaging. This has major time and resource implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A radically different and highly innovative means for imaging glucose with magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) has now been established, exploiting the interaction between hydroxyl protons&#xD;
      in glucose and the protons in water; the method is termed glucose Chemical Exchange&#xD;
      Saturation Transfer (glucoCEST). GlucoCEST MRI is a method that has no reliance on&#xD;
      radiolabelled glucose analogues and could become widely implemented in clinic practice. We&#xD;
      believe that glucoCEST MRI has the potential to replace FDG-PET and improve patient&#xD;
      healthcare as part of a routine clinical pathway in very early detection of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 20 healthy volunteers for developing glucoCEST in the clinical 3T MRI&#xD;
      scanner (development phase) and 20 volunteers without AD and 20 patients with clinically&#xD;
      diagnosed AD (clinical phase). All participants will have a 3T brain MRI scan after they&#xD;
      receive oral glucose. The participants in the clinical phase will have a 3T brain MRI scan, a&#xD;
      brain PET scan and they will also undertake two cognitive tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The glucose uptake and clearance rate in the brain will be measured from PET and MRI scans&#xD;
      and compared between groups and imaging modalities. Sensitivity and specificity of glucoCEST&#xD;
      to detect AD will be also calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To estimate the sensitivity of glucose uptake as measured by glucoCEST MRI&#xD;
      in patients with AD compared with age and sex matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To investigate if the glucose uptake as measured by glucoCEST MRI is&#xD;
      related to the glucose uptake as measured in FDG-PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine normal uptake and clearance rates of glucose in the brain as measured by&#xD;
           dynamic glucoCEST MRI at 3T&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare glucose uptake as measured by glucoCEST MRI and FDG-PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare glucose uptake as measured by glucoCEST MRI in patients with AD and age and&#xD;
           sex matched controls.&#xD;

        Target population: For the methods development phase, 20 healthy volunteers (age 18 years&#xD;
        and above) without contra-indications to MRI will be recruited. Twenty patients with&#xD;
        clinically diagnosed AD and 20 age-matched controls (+/- 3 years) will be recruited to test&#xD;
        the clinical feasibility of glucoCEST.&#xD;
&#xD;
        As a feasibility study, the current work is unlikely to cover the full representative range&#xD;
        of AD patients with diverse phenotypes. Its key purpose is to explore whether the proposed&#xD;
        technique will show different glucose uptake between those with normal cognition and those&#xD;
        with early AD. Further the purpose of future clinical use will be to detect AD in its early&#xD;
        stage where clinical manifestations of AD are either subclinical or very mild. We will&#xD;
        ensure that the sample is representative of the age range of AD patients, as well as sex&#xD;
        balanced.&#xD;
