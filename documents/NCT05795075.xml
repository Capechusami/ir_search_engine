  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lumbar puncture (LP) technique is a widely utilized method for diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      purposes. Recently, the paramedian approach technique (PAT) has garnered increasing interest&#xD;
      due to its advantages over the midline approach technique (MAT), which has traditionally been&#xD;
      used for LP in clinical practice . Utilizing digital virtual human and computer simulation&#xD;
      techniques, a new path has been proposed for the computerized modified paramedian approach&#xD;
      technique (CMPAT). As such, the objective of the present study is to present a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) protocol to investigate and compare the effects of CMPAT versus MAT in&#xD;
      patients requiring LP.&#xD;

    <description>The L3-4 inter-laminar space will be selected as the target for puncture, and in the longitudinal direction, 1.0-1.5cm will be opened beside the upper edge of the spinous process (tip) of the lower vertebra as the entry point. The lumbar puncture needle will be inserted vertically along the axis of the anesthesia needle. The puncture path will be maintained completely perpendicular to the skin until the needle reached the PLTLF (posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia), where some resistance will be felt. The puncture direction is adjusted as needed. The tip of the needle will be tilted 20±10° in the sagittal direction and 15±5° inward such that the tip will point at the midpoint of the spinal canal. After the needle reaches the PLTLF, it will be further inserted 3-7 cm.</description>

    <description>Puncture will be performed on the posterior median line near the midpoint of the L3-4 Space of spinous process. The lumbar puncture needle will be inserted vertically along the axis of the anesthesia needle, or the tip of the needle will be tilted 15° in the sagittal direction toward the head, so that the needle path is parallel to the space of spinous process.</description>
