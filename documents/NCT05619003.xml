  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective single-arm study investigating the safety of Biatain Silicone Sacral while used&#xD;
      as prophylactic prevention amongst hospital admitted patients at risk of developing a&#xD;
      pressure injury.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Biatain Silicone Sacral and Multishape dressings are multi-layer polyurethane foam&#xD;
      dressings. They are CE-marked products and have been on the US market since April 2018. They&#xD;
      are evaluated as safe to use and perform according to their intended purpose and indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation is a Post-market Clinical Follow-up Study, which aims to support the&#xD;
      clinical performance of Biatain Silicone Sacral regarding the use of the dressing as part of&#xD;
      prophylactic therapy to help prevent skin damage, e.g. pressure injuries. A pressure injury&#xD;
      (PI) or pres-sure ulcer (PU) is defined as localized damage to the skin and/or underlying&#xD;
      tissue, as a result of pressure or pressure in combination with shear. PI's usually occur&#xD;
      over a bony prominence, but may also be related to a medical device or other object.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for follow-up clinical data regarding this indication has been suggested in the&#xD;
      Clinical Evaluation for Bi-atain Silicone Sacral and Multishape, and an outline of&#xD;
      investigation CP346 is described in the Post-market Clinical Follow-up section of the&#xD;
      Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) VV-0247441 for Biatain Silicone Sacral and Multishape.&#xD;
