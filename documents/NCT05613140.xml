    <textblock>
      This study evaluated changes in healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and costs of care&#xD;
      within 12 months following initiation of sacubitril/valsartan (sac/val) in commercially&#xD;
      insured and Medicare Advantage (MA) lives in the U.S among adult patients with heart failure&#xD;
      with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (cohort 1) and adult patients with chronic heart&#xD;
      failure (CHF) (cohort 2).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a non-interventional, retrospective cohort study using secondary data sources from&#xD;
      the Optum Clinformatics® Data Mart (CDM) and 100% files of the CMS Medicare RIFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two study cohorts were constructed to include adult Heart Failure with reduced ejection&#xD;
      fraction (HFrEF) patients who newly initiated sacubitril/valsartan (Cohort 1) and adult&#xD;
      Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) patients who newly initiated sacubitril/valsartan (Cohort 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The date of first prescription fill for sacubitril/valsartan during the cohort identification&#xD;
      period was defined as index date. A 12-month washout period was employed to ascertain the&#xD;
      &quot;new user&quot; status. The Healthcare Resource Utilization (HCRU) and costs of care outcomes will&#xD;
      be measured within both the 12 months post-index period and the 12 months pre-index period.&#xD;
