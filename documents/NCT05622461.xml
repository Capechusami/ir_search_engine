  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two main goals: 1) to refine and enhance the R2R-TBI intervention; and 2) to&#xD;
      examine the efficacy of the R2R-TBI intervention in a randomized control trial. To achieve&#xD;
      the second goal, we will employ a between-groups randomized treatment design with repeated&#xD;
      measures at baseline, one-month post-randomization, and at a six-month follow-up. The two&#xD;
      conditions will be: a) usual medical care plus access to internet resources regarding&#xD;
      pediatric brain injury (Internet Resources Comparison group, IRC), and b) usual medical care&#xD;
      plus the R2R-TBI intervention (Road-to-Recovery group, R2R-TBI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The early recovery period constitutes a critical window to set families on a positive&#xD;
      road-to-recovery by supporting parental self-care, positive parent-child interactions, and&#xD;
      awareness of potential longer-term concerns. The latter would facilitate parental recognition&#xD;
      of behavioral and psychosocial needs that might otherwise go unmet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognizing that (1) caregivers of children who have sustained TBI are at risk of worsening&#xD;
      psychological health and that (2) caregiver functioning and parenting behaviors have a direct&#xD;
      impact on child recovery and outcomes; intervening and supporting caregivers in the acute&#xD;
      phase following injury may set children and families on a positive path to recovery.&#xD;
      Intervening at the acute phase may reduce the cascading effects of parental burden/distress&#xD;
      and concomitant negative parent-child interactions on child recovery and functioning over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because families of children with TBI and other chronic health conditions may have difficulty&#xD;
      accessing services due to transportation and cost issues, particularly lower income families,&#xD;
      the R2R-TBI program is designed to be accessed via any web-enabled device (e.g., smartphone,&#xD;
      computer, tablet) with any form of internet connection. We will also offer the intervention&#xD;
      (via tablet) to parents while they wait for their child to complete outpatient therapies&#xD;
      (e.g., speech, physical, and occupational therapy). Delivery of web-based behavioral health&#xD;
      interventions may reduce barriers to help-seeking and promote evidence-based interventions&#xD;
      that are both accessible and efficient.&#xD;
