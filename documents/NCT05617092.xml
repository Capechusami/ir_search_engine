    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot randomized pilot controlled trial (RTC)is to collect acceptability and&#xD;
      feasibility outcomes of a physiotherapy individualized program in women with levator injury&#xD;
      that is intended to be used in a larger scale multicenter randomized controlled trial (RTC)&#xD;
      in the future. The main questions it aims to answer are if a physiotherapy program in women&#xD;
      with a levator injury:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can improve the pelvic floor morphometry (PFM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Can improve urogynecological symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The effect of a physiotherapy program in the sexual function&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The effect of a physiotherapy program in the patient's fear avoidance beliefs about&#xD;
           physical activity and work Type of study: randomized pilot controlled trial (RTC) The&#xD;
           design of this trial will be a pilot randomized controlled trial with 3 arms.&#xD;
           Participants will be randomized in 2 arm of women with levator ani injury to either&#xD;
           physiotherapy or standard care and an arm of woman without levator injury Researchers&#xD;
           will compare the 3 groups to see if a physiotherapy program have benefits in morphometry&#xD;
           of the pelvic floor, urogynecological symptoms, sexual function and to avoid fear&#xD;
           avoidance beliefs about physical activity and work.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The levator ani is a broad, thin muscle group, situated on either side of the pelvis. It&#xD;
      supports the viscera in the pelvic cavity, and surrounds the various structures that pass&#xD;
      through it. The levator ani muscles are of central importance in pelvic organ support and the&#xD;
      maintenance of urinary and fecal continence. Vaginal delivery was associated with a higher&#xD;
      number of pelvic floors injury at different levels (10% to 30% of women with vaginal&#xD;
      deliveries). One of these specific types of pelvic floor injury include levator avulsion&#xD;
      muscle (LAM) and levator ballooning. International clinical guidelines in agreement with&#xD;
      meta-analysis recommend pelvic floor muscle (PFM) physiotherapy as a first line treatment for&#xD;
      symptoms related to postpartum injuries. However, it is unclear whether women with levator&#xD;
      ani injury lesions could respond to physiotherapy. There have been no randomized studies on&#xD;
      this matter and the pilot studies have focused on anatomy rather than symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design A randomized pilot-controlled trial is designed to collect acceptability and&#xD;
      feasibility outcomes of a physiotherapy individualized program in women with levator ani&#xD;
      injury that is intended to be used in a larger scale multicenter randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The design of this trial will be a pilot randomized controlled trial with 3 arms:2&#xD;
      randomized arm of women with levator ani injury to either physiotherapy or standard care and&#xD;
      an arm of woman without levator injury Participants Assessed for eligibility will be&#xD;
      primiparous with a simplex vaginal delivery, aged ≥18 years, that understands the Swedish&#xD;
      language, who approve vaginal examinations and with known risk factors for avulsion&#xD;
      (instrumental delivery, maternal age &gt;35 years, prolonged or precipitous second stage, and&#xD;
      fetal occipito-posterior position).&#xD;
&#xD;
      10-12 weeks after the delivery a clinical 3 D ultrasound of pelvic floor will be perform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with an injury in the levator ani will be randomized into two groups, one for&#xD;
      intervention and the other for control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions The intervention group will receive a physiotherapy individualized treatment&#xD;
      according to the needs of the patient and clinical findings and symptoms with the information&#xD;
      provided by the employed questionnaires and clinic exploration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapy treatment will start from 3 months postpartum to about 1 year after The control&#xD;
      group will receive general information according to the postpartum care guidelines of the&#xD;
      region ( Västrä Gotaland Regionen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this pilot study will be to evaluate the effect of a physiotherapy&#xD;
      program in women with a levator ani injury:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a trial to evaluate the intervention,&#xD;
           including the feasibility and acceptability of randomising the intervention and the&#xD;
           feasibility of outcome measure collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To improve the pelvic floor muscle morphometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To improve the urogynecological symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To improve the sexual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To improve the patient's fear avoidance beliefs about physical activity. Outcome&#xD;
           Morphometrics variables as Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification Examination (POP-Q)&#xD;
           Modified Oxford Grading System and Ultrasound variables: External an external sphincter,&#xD;
           Levator hiatus area at rest (cm2),during Valsalva (cm2) and at maximum contraction (cm2)&#xD;
           LAM area (cm2), Right and left puborectal muscle thickness (mm) will be collect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The followed questionnaires will be use: Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ-7), Pelvic&#xD;
      Floor Distress Inventory-20 (PFDI-20), Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (Physical&#xD;
      Activity/PA) and Female Sexual Function Index FSFI-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility of recruitment will be assessed by exploring: the number of those referred to the&#xD;
      trial over the study period, who meet the eligibility criteria, the number of eligible&#xD;
      patients who consent to participate in the trial over the study period,the number of patients&#xD;
      who decline to participate, the number of participants who consent to participate that remain&#xD;
      in the trial after 4-month follow-up, the number/proportion of participants with complete&#xD;
      baseline data over the study period, the number/proportion of participants with complete&#xD;
      follow-up data at 4 months follow-up, the number/proportion of participants retained at the&#xD;
      end of each module of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Women with an injury in the levator found in the ultrasound will be randomized&#xD;
      with a computer program into two groups, one for intervention and the other for control A&#xD;
      group of women without injury will be invited to filling in the questionnaires that will be&#xD;
      carried out in the study three, six months and one year postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding Ultrasound diagnosis of levator ani muscle injury will be determined by 2&#xD;
      gynecologists blinded to delivery outcomes, using validated protocols. Women with levator ani&#xD;
      injury will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: one (Intervention), and the other (the&#xD;
      comparison group) receiving conventional recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator assessing outcome will be blinded to treatment allocation.&#xD;
