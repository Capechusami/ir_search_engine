  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study to evaluate the safety and preliminary effectiveness of BGT007&#xD;
      cells in the treatment of recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researchers designed a single arm, open, exploratory study to improve the &quot;3+3&quot; dose&#xD;
      escalation. The maximum dose or the best effective dose shall be determined according to the&#xD;
      subject and dose increasing test to verify the safe and effective number of cells per unit&#xD;
      weight. The improved &quot;3+3&quot; dose increasing design was adopted, and BGT007 cells were set with&#xD;
      5 dose groups that were gradually increased for treatment evaluation. The dose groups were&#xD;
      5.0 × 10^5cells/kg，1.0 × 10^6cells/kg，3.0 × 10^6cells/kg，6.0 × 10^6cells/kg，1.0 ×&#xD;
      10^7cells/kg。 Cell reinfusion will be carried out on day 0 (d0), and each subject will be&#xD;
      observed for at least 4 weeks after receiving cell reinfusion (DLT observation period)&#xD;
