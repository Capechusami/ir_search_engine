  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of using&#xD;
      a virtual reality (VR) psychosocial intervention for improving quality of life and&#xD;
      psychological distress in patients hospitalized for bone marrow transplantation (BMT).&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned into one of the study groups: the virtual reality&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention (BMT-VR) + usual care versus usual care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BMT-VR intervention has several components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Psychoeducation to enhance preparedness, manage expectations, and mobilize social&#xD;
           supports.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Psychosocial skill building to promote effective coping and facilitate acceptance while&#xD;
           living with uncertainty of treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Self-care to promote effective coping and enhance patient's sense of control as they&#xD;
           transition from inpatient to outpatient care&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing BMT endure substantial physical and psychological symptoms during a&#xD;
      prolonged hospitalization with significant risk of complications, which negatively impact&#xD;
      their overall quality of life. There is a critical need to develop innovative supportive care&#xD;
      interventions to improve the quality of life and care of patients undergoing BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, randomized, controlled research study to test the feasibility and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of BMT-VR for improving quality of life and reducing psychological&#xD;
      stress for patients undergoing BMT. BMT-VR is a self-administered virtual reality&#xD;
      psychosocial intervention to address the supportive care needs of patients undergoing BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited and randomized in 1:1 fashion to BMT-VR + usual care versus&#xD;
      usual care alone, stratified by transplant type (autologous vs. allogenic BMT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomly assigned to BMT-VR group will receive usual transplant care by their&#xD;
      BMT team and will also be given a virtual reality headset to engage with BMT-VR during their&#xD;
      BMT hospitalization. Participants will complete six sections focused on educating them about&#xD;
      BMT and helping them manage the physical and emotional symptoms with the BMT process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomly assigned to the usual care group will receive usual transplant care by&#xD;
      their BMT team and will not be given access to the BMT-VR intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, participants are asked to complete questionnaires (in-person, over the&#xD;
      computer or telephone, or by mail) at baseline, 2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks after enrolling in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected about 80 participants will take part in this study.&#xD;
