      The purpose of this study is to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with fatal&#xD;
      acute variceal bleeding (AVB) and establish a mortality risk prediction model to identify&#xD;
      patients at high risk of death after admission, so as to guide clinical practice, further&#xD;
      optimize the allocation of emergency resources, and further reduce the mortality of AVB&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      How to predict adverse outcomes of acute variceal bleeding and identify high-risk patients&#xD;
      remains unclear. Most studies related to risk factors for adverse outcomes in AVB patients&#xD;
      took 5 days and 6 weeks as time nodes, and the main outcome indicators were the rebleeding&#xD;
      rate and mortality rate at 5 days and 6 weeks. However, some patients admitted to hospital&#xD;
      may suffer death within a short period of time ,the investigators will define AVB patients at&#xD;
      high risk of death in several hours after admission as fatal acute variceal bleeding.To&#xD;
      identify such patients and give more positive treatment can further reduce the mortality of&#xD;
      AVB. Such risk stratification can be used to further guide the rational allocation of&#xD;
      emergency resources, improve the efficacy of medical resources. This study intends to&#xD;
      retrospectively collect the clinical data of AVB patients in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan&#xD;
      University, analyze the risk factors for death after admission, establish a mortality risk&#xD;
      prediction model, and compare and validate the new model and the scoring model to be&#xD;
      verified.&#xD;

    <description>In this study, patients with liver cirrhosis and acute variceal bleeding in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University in the past 10 years will be selected as the research objects. Patients will be divided into survival and death groups according to whether they died 6 hours after admission. The differences in clinical data between the two groups will be compared and analyzed to decide the risk factors for early death and establish a mortality risk prediction model.</description>
