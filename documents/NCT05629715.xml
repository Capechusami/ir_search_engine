  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is a debilitating disease that can cause severe knee pain and significant&#xD;
      limitations to patients' activities of daily living. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA), also&#xD;
      known as knee replacement surgery, is a well-established and successful procedure for&#xD;
      treatment of end-stage knee osteoarthritis. Over the years, TKA surgical techniques and&#xD;
      implant technology have improved, resulting in better patient outcomes and implant&#xD;
      survivorship. Despite continuous improvements being made to this high demand procedure,&#xD;
      malalignment of component position is a well-known cause of post-operative complications,&#xD;
      including knee pain, component loosening, and failure requiring revision surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced techniques that utilize computer navigation or robotic-arm assistance have been&#xD;
      developed in an attempt to avoid malalignment. Both technologies were created with the goal&#xD;
      of improving the precision of implant positioning and implant sizing in order to improve&#xD;
      lower limb alignment and joint line alignment. The OrthoAlign KneeAlign computer assisted&#xD;
      navigation system is a commercially available device that uses gyroscopic limb position&#xD;
      sensing technology mounted to intramedullary and extramedullary jigs to measure bone&#xD;
      resection cuts in TKA that ultimately dictate implant position. The Zimmer Biomet ROSA Knee&#xD;
      System is a commercially available, FDA-approved robotic assistant for performing TKA. It&#xD;
      uses pre-operative x-rays to create a three-dimensional image of the patient's knee anatomy,&#xD;
      which is used to create a pre-operative template of the implants to be used and provides&#xD;
      intra-operative guidance for bone cuts during the TKA. The robotic system also assesses the&#xD;
      soft tissue envelope around the knee and can assist with the soft tissue balancing of the&#xD;
      knee arthroplasty. Alternatively, it can also be used in an imageless mode where bone cuts&#xD;
      are performed based on intra-operative mapping using anatomic landmarks. To date, there have&#xD;
      been no prospective studies comparing the implant positioning and patient outcomes directly&#xD;
      of the KneeAlign system with the ROSA system and conventional TKA instrumentation techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, unblinded, randomized clinical study designed to&#xD;
      facilitate the collection and evaluation of workflow efficiency, patient pain and function,&#xD;
      adverse event data, and radiographic outcomes for patients undergoing TKA with one of three&#xD;
      instrumentation techniques. This clinical study will include Persona and Legion product&#xD;
      families using the ROSA Knee System, KneeAlign navigation system, or conventional&#xD;
      instrumentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to collect and compare clinical and surgical data&#xD;
      using the commercially available ROSA Knee System instrumentation or OrthAlign KneeAlign&#xD;
      system compared with conventional TKA instrumentation. The hypothesis is that the ROSA Knee&#xD;
      System and KneeAlign system will demonstrate greater accuracy and more consistent component&#xD;
      position and greater patient reported outcome scores compared to conventional TKA surgery.&#xD;
      The investigators suspect that the ROSA system may be more accurate and precise than the&#xD;
      KneeAlign system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 300 subjects in each arm (900 total) are to be enrolled in this study. In order&#xD;
      to minimize selection bias, the investigator will randomize the instrumentation technique&#xD;
      used. Randomization will be accomplished via a random number generator in a 1:1:1 ratio. The&#xD;
      subject will know which treatment arm they are in at the time of study consent. They will be&#xD;
      ineligible for the study if they ask to change treatment arms. The Principal Investigator and&#xD;
      Co-Investigators will be skilled in TKA and experienced implanting Persona or Legion TKA&#xD;
      system. Two of the investigators will only be using the Persona TKA system as this is their&#xD;
      current standard of practice. One of the other investigators will use the Legion TKA system&#xD;
      as this is their standard of practice. In order to avoid potential selection bias, each&#xD;
      investigator will offer study participation to each consecutive eligible patient presenting&#xD;
      as a candidate for primary TKA using the aforementioned implants. All study subjects will&#xD;
      undergo preoperative clinical evaluations prior to their TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An a priori power analysis was conducted using G*Power 3.1 Data Analysis program to determine&#xD;
      the sample size based on a Cohen's f-statistic of 0.25. Power was set at 0.95 and with an&#xD;
      alpha of 0.05. Total sample size based on these parameters was 252 patients. Considering that&#xD;
      three surgeons, who perform approximately 250 TKAs per year each, will be involved, the&#xD;
      investigators estimate that an ability to enroll approximately one-third of all eligible&#xD;
      patients seeking TKA and, thus, set a goal for 300 patients to account for patient attrition&#xD;
      after study initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the use of either conventional, computer navigated or robotic techniques, standard&#xD;
      operating procedures will be followed and all surgical procedures will be performed under&#xD;
      aseptic conditions. Investigators will implant all commercially available components in&#xD;
      compliance with corresponding labeling requirements, and in accordance with appropriate&#xD;
      surgical technique(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-surgical management for study subjects will follow the investigator's standard of care&#xD;
      for patients undergoing TKA (e.g., prophylactic antibiotic therapy, prevention of deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis, prevention of pulmonary embolism, etc.). Post-surgical rehabilitative therapy&#xD;
      will be as prescribed by the investigator. Post-operative clinical evaluation will be&#xD;
      conducted at approximately 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year post-operatively. Subjects&#xD;
      will be followed post-operatively for 1 year.&#xD;
