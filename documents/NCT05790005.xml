  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this experimental study is to determine the effect of therapeutic play method&#xD;
      applied to hospitalized children aged 7-12 before the first surgical dressing attempt, on&#xD;
      anxiety and fear. Researcher will compare the study and control groups to see if therapeutic&#xD;
      play has an effect on anxiety and fear.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      G-Power 3.1.9.4 package program was used for sample size calculation in the study. Children&#xD;
      will be assigned to the study and control groups using the www.randomizer.org program with a&#xD;
      simple randomization method to ensure homogeneity between the study and control groups.&#xD;
      Before dressing, a warm-up play will be played for 10 minutes with the study group, followed&#xD;
      by a 20-minute therapeutic game in which the dramatization method will be used. The children&#xD;
      in the control group will be subjected to the routine dressing procedure. The data of the&#xD;
      research will be collected using the Child and Parent Information Form, Child Anxiety&#xD;
      Scale-State Scale and Child Fear Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the evaluation of the data, the sociodemographic characteristics of the groups&#xD;
      participating in the study will be stated as numbers and percentages, and the normal&#xD;
      distribution of the anxiety scale and fear scale scores before the play, after the play and&#xD;
      after the dressing process in the Intervention and control groups will be determined by&#xD;
      looking at the skewness coefficients. The Factorial Anova Test will be used for mixed&#xD;
      measurements in order to examine the anxiety and fear changes of the children in the&#xD;
      Intervention and control groups before the play, after the play and after the dressing&#xD;
      process. In addition, since this test does not measure the different changes between the&#xD;
      groups, the Anova Test in Repeated Measurements will be used to compare the anxiety and fear&#xD;
      scores of only the Intervention group and only the control group before the play, after the&#xD;
      play and after the dressing process. If the data do not have a normal distribution, the&#xD;
      Friedman Test, which is a nonparametric test, will be used.&#xD;

    <description>2 days after the operation, 1 hour before the dressing, a warm-up game will be played with the child in the playroom of the pediatric surgery service, aiming to put the organs prepared by the researcher in their correct places on the picture for the first 10 minutes. Then, the teddy bear, which is given the appearance of an operation area by sewing a zipper on his stomach, will be given to the child and he will be asked to make the first dressing of the teddy bear. therapeutic game, in which the dramatization method is used, will last 20 minutes. During the 30-minute play practice, the child's questions will be answered.</description>
