  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm observational pilot study aims to determine the longitudinal effects of&#xD;
      androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) in men with advanced prostate cancer. The&#xD;
      primary outcome for this trial is physical function, which will be evaluated at baseline, 12&#xD;
      and 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes including body composition, muscle function, balance,&#xD;
      arterial stiffness and patient reported outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot trial is to obtain objective measurements of physical function in&#xD;
      men with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) initiating ARSI treatment at baseline, 12, and 24&#xD;
      weeks later. Grip strength, muscular power, body composition, balance, arterial stiffness,&#xD;
      along with QoL, fatigue, anxiety, and depression will also be measured. Finally, the&#xD;
      potential associations in primary and secondary outcomes by the type of ARSI, stage of mPC,&#xD;
      and physical activity levels will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With more men requiring ARSI treatment for metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
      (mCRPC), as well as being an efficacious option earlier in metastatic castrate sensitive&#xD;
      prostate cancer (mCSPC), accurate estimates of declines from ARSI initiation are required to&#xD;
      determine the true effects. Utilizing novel assessments in mPC like muscular power tests will&#xD;
      provide insight into potentially more relevant assessments and outcomes to intervene on. The&#xD;
      data from this pilot study will also determine effect sizes to adequately power future&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

    <description>The short physical performance battery (SPPB) is a group of measures that combines the results of the gait speed, chair stand and balance tests. It has been used as a predictive tool for possible disability and can aid in the monitoring of function in older people. The scores range from 0 (worst performance) to 12 (best performance). The SPPB has been shown to have predictive validity showing a gradient of risk for mortality, nursing home admission, and disability. Clinically meaningful changes are 0.3-1.0 points.</description>

    <description>Balance will be assessed using the NeuroCom Smart Balance Master. A sensory organization test will be performed.

The composite score is a weighted-average of the following 14 scores: the condition 1 average score, the condition 2 average score, and the three equilibrium scores from each of the trials in conditions 3-6.</description>

    <description>Balance will be assessed using the NeuroCom Smart Balance Master. A sensory organization test will be performed. An overall composite equilibrium score describing a person's overall level of performance during all of the trials in the sensory organization test is calculated, with a value between 0 and 100, with 0 indicating a large sway and loss of balance, and 100 indicating greater postural control. The composite score is a weighted-average of the following 14 scores: the condition 1 average score, the condition 2 average score, and the three equilibrium scores from each of the trials in conditions 3-6.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Arterial stiffness will be measured using the SphygmoCor Xcel (AtCor Medical). Arterial stiffness will be assessed using brachial pulse wave analysis (PWA) augmentation index and carotid-femoral pulse wave analysis (PWV). Greater PWA augmentation index and carotid-femoral PWV time indicates greater arterial stiffness, a surrogate end-point for cardiovascular disease.</description>
