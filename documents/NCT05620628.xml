  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent developments, the prognosis of patients with advanced gastric cancer is still&#xD;
      poor, and the target treatment options studied in a recently completed randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial in which patients with tumors expressing HER2 were treated with trastuzumab are&#xD;
      proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the survival period of patients treated with trastzumab was extended to less&#xD;
      than 3 months. Despite these results, 80% of patients are still not eligible for trastzumab&#xD;
      and need additional targeted therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The largest somatic cell mutation frequency recorded in tumors can lead to higher renal&#xD;
      antigen release and provision to the immune system. In addition, in some clinical trials,&#xD;
      abnormal overexpression of MET was associated with poor clinical progress, rapid disease&#xD;
      progression, and short survival period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double blocking of PD-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 appeared to&#xD;
      increase inhibition of tumor growth compared to the treatment of each monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, the efficacy and safety of combination administration of&#xD;
      immunoglobulin G1 that inhibits PD-L1 with MET amplification and Saboritinib (AZD6094), an&#xD;
      MET inhibitor, are to be confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically identified metastatic and recurrent gastric cancer, ECOG systemic activity of&#xD;
      0 or 1 and at least one measurable lesion in accordance with modified RECIST 1.1 According to&#xD;
      the NGS results, the efficacy and safety of the combination administration of dervalumab and&#xD;
      saboritinib are evaluated for gastric cancer patients scheduled for secondary and tertiary&#xD;
      treatment with MET amplification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Savoritinib is administered oral once a day at 600 mg (QD) every 28 days if it is more than&#xD;
      50 KG. Dervalumab is administered intravenously every four weeks from the first day of the&#xD;
      first cycle CT will be used every 8 weeks from the first administration date to check the&#xD;
      progress of the objective disease. Patients have evidence that they are resistant to&#xD;
      treatment and useful in clinical trials, and if the supply of drugs is secured, they will&#xD;
      continue to be treated with saboritinib and dervalumab.&#xD;
