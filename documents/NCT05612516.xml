    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to clinically assess the peroxide levels in saliva during bleaching&#xD;
      with 9.5% hydrogen peroxide using a tray with or without reservoir.&#xD;

      Statement of the Problem There is more concern about the possible adverse effect of bleaching&#xD;
      agent, patients report gastrointestinal mucosal irritation e.g. a burning palate, throat and&#xD;
      minor upsets in the stomach and intestine. Some adverse effects of hydrogen peroxide as a&#xD;
      dental bleaching agent include dentin sensitivity and/or gingival irritation led by unstable&#xD;
      and reactive H+ free radicals and low pH from prolonged use. Peroxide is a highly reactive&#xD;
      substance which can damage oral soft tissues and hard tissues when present in high&#xD;
      concentrations and with exposures of prolonged duration. (Alqahtani, 2014). Several&#xD;
      researches have focused on the problem of gel ingestion and potential peroxide release in&#xD;
      saliva (Dahl et al, 2003; Watt et al, 2004; Bernardon et al, 2010; Goldberg et al, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reservoirs are modifications in the tray molds to increase the amount of bleaching material&#xD;
      carried by the bleaching tray, seeking greater bleaching efficacy. The use of reservoirs in&#xD;
      the bleaching trays was initially seen as positive, since higher accumulation of material&#xD;
      could provide the patient with greater treatment efficacy. Martini et al, 2020 stated that&#xD;
      there is no significant difference between groups whitened with and without reservoirs for&#xD;
      gingival irritation or tooth sensitivity. Most authors and bleaching gel manufacturers&#xD;
      recommend the use of reservoirs to increase the amount of product available for bleaching and&#xD;
      to allow for complete seating of the bleaching tray, although that the reservoirs decrease&#xD;
      tray retention and increase lab fabrication time and cost (Javaheri et al, 2000). The&#xD;
      presence of reservoirs decreases the retention of the tray, allowing more room for the gel&#xD;
      but also reducing the adaptation of the tray. That may cause more leakage of the material,&#xD;
      which may lead to more peroxide level in saliva. (Haywood et al, 1992).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major concern for clinicians was the potential toxicological effect of hydrogen peroxide&#xD;
      contacting soft tissues. A safe hydrogen peroxide exposure level (no observed effect level)&#xD;
      was determined with catalase-deficient mice, reporting a maximum dose of 26 mg/kg/d. This&#xD;
      corresponds to the dose level in humans, considering the conventional uncertainty factor of&#xD;
      100-fold, of 0.26 mg/kg/d (IGHRC, 2003; Hannig et al, 2005; Li et al, 2011). The safety of&#xD;
      hydrogen peroxide products used for at home bleaching regarding peroxide release in saliva&#xD;
      has not been fully proven.&#xD;

    <description>A spectrophotometry method based on the reaction of 4-aminoantipyrine and phenol with hydrogen peroxide will be adopted. This method will allow the oxidation of peroxide by peroxidase enzyme, resulting in solution color change from transparent to pink. The amount of hydrogen peroxide in saliva will be quantified by an analytic spectrophotometer, which will relate light absorbance with peroxide concentration of each sample.</description>

    <description>. Alginate impressions of maxillary dental arches of patients will be taken to obtain casts and produce the customized trays.&#xD;
Reservoirs 1.5 mm thick will be created on the facial surfaces of anterior teeth, including the first premolars in the arches, applying a light-cured resin on the casts. The resin layer thickness will be standardized using a thickness gauge (1.5 mm thickness). Then, customized trays will be fabricated with 1.5 mm-thick vinyl acetate sheets using the thermoforming process. Trays will be precisely trimmed completely involving tooth surface (1.5 mm incisal or occlusal to gingival margin), and the adaptation will be verified on the casts. The trays will be placed over teeth to verify the adaptation in the patients' mouth.</description>
