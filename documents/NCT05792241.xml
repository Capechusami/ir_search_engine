  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching objective of this two-phase project is to assess the effects of fortifying&#xD;
      iodized salt with folic acid on improving women's folate status and thereby reduce the risk&#xD;
      of neural tube defects (NTDs), which are highly prevalent in Ethiopia. The project will be&#xD;
      conducted in two phases. The purpose of Phase 1, described herein, is to complete formative&#xD;
      research in preparation for a community-based, randomized trial, which will be carried out in&#xD;
      Phase 2. The objectives of Phase 1 are to: 1) assess the hematological condition and&#xD;
      nutritional status with respect to folate, iodine, and other micronutrients among&#xD;
      non-pregnant women of reproductive age (WRA) in the study communities, and 2) measure&#xD;
      discretionary salt and dietary folate intakes of the women and their households.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potentially eligible women of reproductive age (WRA) will be identified from existing&#xD;
      community census records and will be listed sequentially. A random number generator will be&#xD;
      used to select individual women from this list for possible participation in the Phase 1&#xD;
      studies. In cases where two or more WRA are selected from the same household (HH), one will&#xD;
      be randomly selected for possible participation in the study and the other(s) will be&#xD;
      replaced by a WRA from another HH, using the same random selection procedure. A member of the&#xD;
      study team will then visit the homes of women who are selected for possible participation in&#xD;
      Phase 1 to describe the study to them, assess their eligibility, and request their consent to&#xD;
      participate. In particular, the data collector will present an initial disclosure statement&#xD;
      concerning the screening interview and will then obtain descriptive information from verbally&#xD;
      consenting women on their age, general health status, address, cell phone number (if&#xD;
      available), and potential willingness to participate in the subsequent research studies. The&#xD;
      data collector will review the women's health history and determine their eligibility for the&#xD;
      Phase 1 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For women who found to be eligible to participate in the Phase 1 study, the field worker will&#xD;
      describe the purpose of the study, the study procedures and related risks and benefits, the&#xD;
      confidentiality of results, and the fact that participation is voluntary. After providing an&#xD;
      opportunity for women to consult with family members and ask any questions to the research&#xD;
      team, the field worker (in the presence of a neutral witness) will request written consent&#xD;
      from the women to participate in the study. Additional questions will be asked of consenting&#xD;
      women regarding their marital status, ethnicity, religion, educational level, and employment;&#xD;
      and their housing characteristics (housing construction, water source, sanitary facilities,&#xD;
      access to electricity and cell phone service); and selected HH assets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible, consenting women will be requested to report to the Chefe Donsa Health Center&#xD;
      or one of the local health posts within the next one or two days following the initial&#xD;
      screening interview for fasting blood collection, anthropometric assessment, additional&#xD;
      interviews, and scheduling of subsequent home visits by the study team for full-day dietary&#xD;
      observations to measure discretionary salt intake and folate intake and to initiate 24-hour&#xD;
      urine collections to measure sodium and iodine excretion. The fasting blood specimens will be&#xD;
      collected for a complete blood count and measurement of red blood cell (RBC) folate and serum&#xD;
      folate, unmetabolized folic acid, vitamin B12, holo-transcobalamin, methyl malonic acid,&#xD;
      other B vitamins, genetic polymorphisms that affect folate metabolism, thyroglobulin,&#xD;
      glucose, insulin, retinol binding protein (RBP), ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor,&#xD;
      C-reactive protein, and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein and to complete a malaria rapid diagnostic&#xD;
      test (RDT). Serum retinol will be measured in a subset of 40 women to establish the&#xD;
      relationship between serum retinol and RBP in the study population. Blood specimens may also&#xD;
      be collected from a subset of 20 women for possible metabolomics assays and natural killer&#xD;
      cell (immune function) assays. Women with a positive RDT and those subsequently found to have&#xD;
      anemia (Hb&lt;13.2 g/dL, to adjust for altitude) will be referred to the local health facility&#xD;
      for treatment. Additional interviews will be completed to assess the women's birth history,&#xD;
      contraceptive use, and household food insecurity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women will participate in dietary assessments and 24-hour urine collections on one day&#xD;
      within four weeks of enrollment, and a randomly selected sub-set of 40 women will complete&#xD;
      these studies on a second day one-to-two weeks later. The purpose of the second set of&#xD;
      studies is to allow for calculation of intra-individual variation in intakes and urinary&#xD;
      sodium and iodine excretion, which is necessary to estimate the distribution of usual&#xD;
      discretionary salt and folate intake and urinary sodium and iodine excretion of the study&#xD;
      population. The dietary studies will involve a dietitian who will remain in the participant's&#xD;
      home throughout the day to weigh all foods included in mixed dishes and to weigh the amounts&#xD;
      served and consumed. Portions of each food will be collected to analyze these in the&#xD;
      laboratory for sodium and selected nutrient contents. The investigators The investigators&#xD;
      will also carry out HH salt disappearance studies over a period of one week using iodized&#xD;
      refined salt provided by the project to determine the rate of salt utilization in relation to&#xD;
      HH size. This information will be used to estimate the quantities of salt that we will need&#xD;
      to deliver during Phase 2.&#xD;
