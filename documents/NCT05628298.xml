  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies indicate that up to 75% of women will experience pain sometime during their&#xD;
      pregnancy. Recent recommendations by the FDA recommended that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      (NSAIDS) medications be avoided during pregnancy. This recommendation limits the pain&#xD;
      medications available for use during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antidotal evidence suggests that the FDA cleared Soovu pulsed heat device may produce pain&#xD;
      relief during pregnancy. This study tests the Soovu device's ability to provide pain relief&#xD;
      during pregnancy and up to one month post-partum and may eventually offer a safe nondrug&#xD;
      option to treat pregnancy related pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational pilot study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective and hypothesis of this study is that the use of the Soovu pain&#xD;
      management device will produce a significant reduction of pain when comparing pre versus post&#xD;
      treatment pain.&#xD;

      Pain associated with pregnancy occurs in approximately 60 to 70% of women. The mechanism of&#xD;
      action of pulsed heat and TRPV-1 blockade is expected to be relevant in this population based&#xD;
      on the etiology of their pain, and should help reduce their pain. In addition, there have&#xD;
      been several pregnant women who have used the device to treat their pain associated with&#xD;
      pregnancy. Their use was driven partly based on the FDA's recommendation to avoid&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications limiting medication options. Based on these&#xD;
      antidotal experiences and feedback, as well as the device's mechanism of action, this study&#xD;
      is proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a pilot observational study that will provide results to support a larger more&#xD;
      rigorous and involved clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the Soovu Pain Relief device&#xD;
           is effective in reducing pain associated with pregnancy in the 2nd and 3rd trimester and&#xD;
           in the first month postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The secondary objectives include testing whether the study device reduces the effects of&#xD;
           pain on physical function and the satisfaction and opinions of both subjects and&#xD;
           providers on the effectiveness and usability of the study device. Subjects will also be&#xD;
           asked about and needed pain medication use and their experience with the device if they&#xD;
           used it during delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is a single center nonrandomized non blinded pilot study on the effects of&#xD;
      the Soovu Pain Relief device in pregnancy associated pain. 25-35 subjects are planned in the&#xD;
      study which covers the 2nd and 3rd trimester and one month post-partum. Subjects will be&#xD;
      referred to the study by their care providers or via posters in the clinic. Each subject who&#xD;
      enters the study will receive a Soovu Pain Relief device with instructions on its use. All&#xD;
      subjects will continue to receive their usual care. There are no visits associated with&#xD;
      involvement in the study. Subjects can elect to use the device to treat their pain during the&#xD;
      study and will record their pain level pre and post use. The data is collected via the phone&#xD;
      app that controls the device. Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject&#xD;
      eligibility. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be entered into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study is expected to be 14 months. 6-7 months for subject&#xD;
      recruitment and 7 months for final subject follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is the difference between the numerical pain score (0-10)&#xD;
      pretreatment versus post treatment. Pain relief is the primary outcome measure as related to&#xD;
      the study pain management device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The secondary efficacy endpoints include whether the study&#xD;
      device reduces the effects of pain on physical function and the satisfaction and opinions of&#xD;
      both subjects and providers on the effectiveness and usability of the study device. The&#xD;
      physical function questionnaire is a well validated instrument form the PROMIS outcome&#xD;
      library and is a measure of function not necessarily pain. The usability and satisfaction&#xD;
      evaluations help determine subject and provider acceptance of the device and can lead to&#xD;
      product improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes measure is pain level pre versus post treatment with the Soovu Device on&#xD;
      a 0-10 point numeric scale. The data will be modeled as a repeated measures ordinal&#xD;
      regression (primary choice), or a repeated measures model on a continuous response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Secondary Endpoints Changes on the PROMIS pain interference short form measure&#xD;
      given on a monthly basis during the study will be analyzed using a Anova repeated measures&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject satisfaction with the experimental Soovu device at monthly intervals and one month&#xD;
      post-partum if indicated (Likert scale) will be tabulated and represented as a mean value&#xD;
      with standard deviations. Subjects will also be asked whether they needed any supplemental&#xD;
      pain medications and the name or type of medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provider assessment and opinions of device (Likert scale) at study conclusion and one month&#xD;
      post-partum. The results will be tabulated and represented as a mean value with standard&#xD;
      deviations.&#xD;
