      This study is a non-interventional observational study. On the baseline (Visit 1), we collect&#xD;
      demographic data from all participating subjects according to their daily medical conditions,&#xD;
      prescribe drugs and collect validity and safety data according to the research plan in Visit&#xD;
      1 and Visit 2. In addition, we collect data by application on subject's self-awareness&#xD;
      symptoms and subject's questionnaire for medical outcome short form health survey (SF-36)&#xD;
      every day from the baseline for 4 days.&#xD;

      The investigator will enroll subjects according to Inclusion/Exclusion criteria after&#xD;
      obtaining Informed Consent Form from each subject. Enrolled subjects will administer&#xD;
      Zoledronic Acid 5mg/100mL once on baseline (Visit 1). The demographic data, prescription&#xD;
      data, and medical history, etc will be collected based on the approved protocol. Additionally&#xD;
      using application, subject's self-awareness symptoms and subject's questionnaire for medical&#xD;
      outcome short form health survey (SF-36) every day from the baseline for 4 days will be&#xD;
