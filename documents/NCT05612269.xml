      Since the discovery of SGLT2 inhibitors, there is a great shift in diabetic treatment, so&#xD;
      this drug is magic, this drug can reduce the blood sugar level by blocking the reabsorption&#xD;
      of glucose in the kidney and increasing glucose excretion the first discovery by Josef von&#xD;
      Mering who discovered the glucosuric effect of phlorizin. Phlorizin is the progenitor of&#xD;
      contemporary SGLT2 inhibitors, the FDA did not consider the work of Baron Josef von Mering,&#xD;
      since he had already discovered acidosis following the administration of phlorizin in 1888.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Now SGLT2 inhibitors are used widely and even for heart failure without diabetes as this drug&#xD;
      is useful and with lower risk of death from observational studies The 2008 FDA guidance had a&#xD;
      major impact on the cardiovascular (CV) risk assessment of recently approved antidiabetic&#xD;
      drugs, many trials were done on SGLT2 inhibitors like the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, the CANVAS&#xD;
      trial program, MACE these groups have CVS benefits and also renal benefits as regards, we&#xD;
      suspect long-term benefits and immunity aspect these groups play an important role in cancer&#xD;
      incidence from meta-analysis and systematic review, suggests that SGLT2 inhibition results in&#xD;
      a reduction of inflammatory markers like interleukin-6 in animal models, further validating&#xD;
      the suggested anti-inflammatory mechanism of action.&#xD;

      The map of treatment of diabetes and obesity was changed dramatically and newer drugs were&#xD;
      discovered in the last 10 years for improving the quality of patients and prevent&#xD;
      complications and cardiovascular and renal benefits from SGLT2 inhibitors In our study, we&#xD;
      will discuss the risk of cancer among diabetics on SGLT2 inhibitors and measurement of&#xD;
      inflammatory factors like CRP and interleukin -6 alongside the other investigations the study&#xD;
      included 200 adults patients with type 2 diabetes on SGLT2 inhibitors and follow up these&#xD;
      patients for one year for the inflammatory factors and risk of cancer among them and this&#xD;
      study include patients from 18 years to 70 years having diabetes type 2 male or female,&#xD;
      smoker or not smokers, non-diabetic ketoacidosis&#xD;

        A study of a group of individuals having diabetes type 2 above 18 years taking any types of&#xD;
        SGLT2 inhibitors like canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin. similar at the&#xD;
        disease stage and no history of any type of cancer we will measure the interleukin 6 and&#xD;
        CRP among these patients and follow up for one year for calculating the risk of occurrence&#xD;
        of any type of cancer&#xD;
