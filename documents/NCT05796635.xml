    <measure>The primary aim of this research is to understand the changes in cold sore severity.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cold sore severity will be measured via survey and cold sore severity grading. Symptom severity is rated on a scale of 0 (Not a problem) to 6 (Severe)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary objective of this trial is to examine differences in cold sore frequency between the two groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cold sore frequency will be measured via a self-reported survey measuring the frequency of cold sore occurrence during the study period compared to baseline.</description>

    <description>Participants in the Herpecin L arm will use the test product daily as a preventive product by applying the product twice daily. Also, participants will be told they can reapply the product if going outside into the cold, wind, or sun. If participants in the Herpecin L arm do experience a cold sore or fever blister, they will be instructed to use the product at the first sign of the cold sore and then at least four more times during the day until the cold sore is gone (they can use the product more often if they plan to go outside into the cold, sun, or wind).</description>
