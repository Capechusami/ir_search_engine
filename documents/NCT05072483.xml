      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarct and&#xD;
      leukoencephalopathy) is a genetic disorder. It causes narrowing of the small blood vessels&#xD;
      and can lead to strokes and dementia. Researchers want to monitor people with CADASIL over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about how CADASIL affects a person s blood vessels over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older who have CADASIL, and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical record review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 4 study visits over 9 years. Visits will last 6 8 hours per day, for 2&#xD;
      4 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give blood and urine samples. They will have an electrocardiogram to record&#xD;
      their heart s electrical activity. They will fill out a family tree. They will have tests&#xD;
      that measure mental abilities like memory and attention. They may have a skin biopsy. They&#xD;
      may have a lumbar puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an eye exam. Their pupils will be dilated. They will receive a dye via&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) line. Pictures will be taken of their eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an imaging scan of their brain. They may receive a contrast agent via&#xD;
      IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants blood flow and blood vessel flexibility will be measured. In one test, a probe&#xD;
      will be pressed against the skin of the their wrist, neck, and groin. In another test, they&#xD;
      will hold one arm still while a microscope makes videos of the blood flow through a&#xD;
      fingernail. In another test, they will perform light exercise or other activities while&#xD;
      wearing an elastic band around their head or probes placed on their arm or leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will complete some of the above tests.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a disease discovery/natural history protocol. We will enroll 100 CADASIL subjects to&#xD;
      perform in-depth prospective and retrospective evaluations for research purposes. Some&#xD;
      evaluations will be compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: This study will examine the pathogenesis and progression of CADASIL&#xD;
      through comprehensive evaluations, and molecular studies on biospecimens collected from&#xD;
      affected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: Comprehensive evaluations will be used to investigate variability of the&#xD;
      genotype and clinical phenotype of CADASIL during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective: Healthy controls may be used for comparison for some of the research&#xD;
      testing where data on normal values is lacking. Healthy controls will not be used to&#xD;
      establish normal range values but for qualitative comparison with CADASIL population.&#xD;

        We will follow 100 subjects with CADASIL (80 new CADASIL subjects and up to 20 CADASIL&#xD;
        subjects previously enrolled in our pilot study, if they would like to participate in this&#xD;
        study as well) and up to 40 healthy controls male and female, ages 18-100. Should anyone&#xD;
        from the original patient cohort decide not to participate in this new study, additional&#xD;
        patients will be recruited in order to meet our goal of having 100 CADASIL subjects&#xD;
        enrolled in the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
