    <textblock>
      Hip arthroplasty surgery is frequently performed on elderly patients in the community and it&#xD;
      is associated with long-term postoperative hospital stays and high mortality. Severe&#xD;
      postoperative pain may further reduce the limited cardiopulmonary capacity, especially in the&#xD;
      elderly population. Postoperative effective pain treatment provides early mobilization and&#xD;
      shorter hospital stay, thus complications due to hospitalization such as infection and&#xD;
      thromboembolism may be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain management is a multimodal process that includes intravenous and regional&#xD;
      anesthesia methods. Parenteral opioids are generally preferred in the management of acute&#xD;
      postoperative pain. However, opioids have undesired adverse events such as nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      itching, sedation, and respiratory depression (opioid-related adverse events). Regional&#xD;
      anesthesia techniques are frequently preferred as a part of multimodal analgesia in hip&#xD;
      surgeries. Various methods may be performed to reduce the use of systemic opioids and for&#xD;
      effective pain treatment. US-guided interfascial plane blocks have been used increasingly due&#xD;
      to the advantages of ultrasound in anesthesia practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound(US) guided erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is injected with a local&#xD;
      anesthetic into the deep fascia of the erector spinae. Visualization of sonoanatomy with the&#xD;
      US is simple and the spread of local anesthetic solution can be seen easily in the deep&#xD;
      fascia of the erector spinae. Visualization of sonoanatomy in the US is easy, and the spread&#xD;
      of local anesthetic agents can be easily seen under the erector spinae muscle. Thus,&#xD;
      analgesia occurs in several dermatomes with cephalad-caudad way. Cadaveric studies have shown&#xD;
      that the injection spreads to the ventral and dorsal roots of the spinal nerves. In the&#xD;
      literature, it has been reported that ESPB provides effective analgesia after a hip surgery.&#xD;
      The fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) is a safe method used for postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      following hip, femoral, and knee surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare US-guided FICB and ESPB for postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      management after total hip prosthesis surgery. The primary aim is to compare perioperative&#xD;
      and postoperative opioid consumption and the secondary aim is to evaluate postoperative pain&#xD;
      scores (VAS), and adverse effects related to opioids (allergic reaction, nausea, vomiting).&#xD;

    <description>ESP block will be performed. US probe will be placed longitudinally 2-3 cm lateral to the L3 transverse process. Erector spinae muscle will be visualized on the hyperechoic transverse process. The block needle (100 mm, 22G) will be inserted cranio-caudal direction and then for correction of the needle 2 ml saline will be injected deep into the erector spinae muscle fascia. Following confirmation of the correct position of the needle 30 ml 0.25% bupivacaine will be administered for the block.</description>

    <description>FIC block will be performed in the supine position. The linear probe is placed transversely to identify the femoral artery, iliopsoas muscle, and fascia iliaca at the inguinal crease. The probe will be tilted cranially and caudally until optimal images of the fascia iliaca are obtained. Block needle (50 mm, 22G) will be passed through the iliac fascia via the in-plane method. Once the needle tip will be placed within the interfacial plane and after careful aspiration to rule out intravascular needle placement, 2 mL of saline will be injected to confirm the proper injection site, and then a dose of 0.25% bupivacaine 30 mL will be injected.</description>
