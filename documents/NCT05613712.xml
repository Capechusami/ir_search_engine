      In the rheumatology department of the CHU Grenoble Alpes, Professor Baillet and other&#xD;
      rheumatologists have set up a holistic assessment of inflammatory rheumatism (rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis, spondyloarthritis and psoriatic arthritis) and associated co-morbidities in a day&#xD;
      hospital. Based on this assessment, a hospital report is drawn up summarising the patient's&#xD;
      treatment options, which is then sent to the patient's referring physician. They analysed the&#xD;
      first 100 patients in the cohort and showed that 98% of patients were not up to date with&#xD;
      their care. Their longitudinal analysis shows that patients update two thirds of the&#xD;
      recommendations made within 12 to 18 months. Therefore, the investigators would like to&#xD;
      assess the applicability of this screening in these patients, through a questionnaire sent to&#xD;
      the 400 patients of the cohort and to their treating physicians.&#xD;
