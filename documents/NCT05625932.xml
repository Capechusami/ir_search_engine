  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who are scheduled to receive systemic&#xD;
      cancer therapy have an increased risk for venous thromboembolic (VTE) events compared with&#xD;
      the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTINCOL is a randomized, open label, non placebo-controlled, low intervention, and phase&#xD;
      III clinical trial that will recruit patients with mCRC. The study hypothesizes that&#xD;
      prophylaxis with Tinzaparin could prevent the appearance of symptomatic and incidental VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive the first-line anticancer treatment deemed more appropriate&#xD;
      according to the physician criteria. Enrolled patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      (stratifying by BRAF/RAS, resection of primary tumor, and anti-angiogenic first-line&#xD;
      treatment) to: control arm (no interventions related to VTE risk and no placebo) or&#xD;
      experimental arm (prophylactic Tinzaparin at a fixed dose of 4500 IU/day in patients with up&#xD;
      to 80kg, 6000 IU/day for those between 80-100 kg, or 8000 IU/day for those &gt;100kg). Treatment&#xD;
      is scheduled for a maximum period of 4 months. Treatment could be stopped earlier in case of&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, patient consent withdrawal, physician criteria or end of study.&#xD;
      Patients will undergo tumor and VTE assessments according to standard clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of tinzaparin for the prevention&#xD;
      of symptomatic or incidental VTE events. Secondary objectives include the associations&#xD;
      between VTE events and tumor characteristics (i.e. laterality, RAS/BRAF mutations) or&#xD;
      management (i.e. surgery or treatment with anti-angiogenic or anti-EGFR agents),&#xD;
      cancer-specific survival outcomes, safety, the incidence of bleeding events, and&#xD;
      patient-reported quality of life. The trial includes also a translational exploratory&#xD;
      analysis to assess the predictive value of risk assessment models and genetic risk scores,&#xD;
      their evolution through the study and microsatellite instability or other biomarkers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a prospective, randomized, open label (PROBE), non placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      and phase III clinical trial; Investigator Initiated Study (IIS). The study has been&#xD;
      considered a low-interventional clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will compare the efficacy and safety of tinzaparin with a watch and wait strategy&#xD;
      for primary prophylaxis of symptomatic or incidental VTE in adult men and women, 18 years of&#xD;
      age and older, with metastatic colorectal cancer who are scheduled to initiate systemic&#xD;
      cancer therapy as a component of their standard of care anticancer regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 3 periods: a 4-week screening period, a 4 months treatment period and&#xD;
      post-treatment follow-up period until the end of treatment (EOT) visit, scheduled 2 months&#xD;
      after the last dose of tinzaparin or 6 months from the first dose of tinzaparin (whichever&#xD;
      occurs latest). The duration of participation in the study for each subject is approximately&#xD;
      6 months. Further long-term phone follow-up to monitor for progression and survival could be&#xD;
      carried out at the end of study. Tumor follow-up assessments will adhere to the standard&#xD;
      clinical practice within each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive the first-line anticancer treatment deemed more appropriate&#xD;
      according to the physician criteria and current guideline recommendations. Patients in both&#xD;
      groups will receive supportive care as per local practice. No formal recommendations will be&#xD;
      issued by the study protocol regarding cancer treatment and supportive care, but the drugs&#xD;
      used will be recorded in the clinical report form. Constitutive use of anticoagulant drugs&#xD;
      will be prohibited during the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the control arm, or the experimental arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm: A watch and wait strategy will be used. There is no placebo. Since no reference&#xD;
      treatment is available for long-term VTE prophylaxis in patients with cancer, patients in the&#xD;
      control group will not receive VTE prophylaxis outside the hospital and will receive&#xD;
      anticancer treatment and supportive care as per local practice. No formal recommendations&#xD;
      will be issued by the study protocol regarding cancer treatment and supportive care, but the&#xD;
      drugs used will be recorded in the clinical report form (CRF). Patients in the control group&#xD;
      will receive antithrombotic prophylaxis as per local practice during hospitalizations. Any&#xD;
      use of LMWH will be recorded in the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental arm: Patients will receive prophylaxis tinzaparin at a fixed dose daily for 4&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of 4-months prophylaxis with tinzaparin for&#xD;
      the prevention of symptomatic or incidental VTE events. Secondary efficacy objectives include&#xD;
      the VTE incidence in specific subpopulations (stratification according to the laterality of&#xD;
      the primary tumor, first-line treatment with anti-EGFR or antiangiogenics, and mutational&#xD;
      status).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of tinzaparin will be evaluated by means of relevant adverse events, incidence of&#xD;
      bleedings according to International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) criteria,&#xD;
      and patient-reported quality of life. Bleeding events will be evaluated locally by the&#xD;
      investigator and centrally by a blinded committee.&#xD;
