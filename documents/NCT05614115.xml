  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if empagliflozin, a new diabetic medication that has&#xD;
      been shown to be very effective in lowering the risk of heart failure, is safe and tolerated&#xD;
      in dialysis patients. In the recent years, empagliflozin has become a major tool to prevent&#xD;
      heart failure hospitalization and to reduce the risk for cardiovascular death in diabetic and&#xD;
      non-diabetic patients. Although patients with severe chronic kidney disease and ESKD have&#xD;
      very high risk of heart failure and cardiovascular death, they have been excluded from all of&#xD;
      the previous studies. If this medication is found to be well tolerated and safe in dialysis&#xD;
      patients through this study, future clinical studies can evaluate if this medication can also&#xD;
      reduce the risk of heart failure and cardiovascular death in dialysis patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients on dialysis have a very high risk of heart failure and heart-related death compared&#xD;
      to people who do not require dialysis. While treatment options for heart failure have&#xD;
      improved over the years for those without kidney disease, there has been very limited&#xD;
      discoveries to improve survival for dialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Empagliflozin, a new diabetic medication that works by making the kidney put out more sugar&#xD;
      in the urine, has recently shown to have significant efficacy to protect the kidney and to&#xD;
      reduce heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death in both diabetic and&#xD;
      non-diabetic patients. Studies suggest that this medication may have benefits on the heart,&#xD;
      fat cells, blood vessels, and possibly other organ systems. The benefit remains consistent&#xD;
      whether you have diabetes or not. Empagliflozin is now approved by the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) to treat not only diabetes but also chronic kidney disease and to reduce&#xD;
      the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults regardless&#xD;
      of the diabetes status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical studies, however, have excluded those with severe kidney disease and those&#xD;
      requiring dialysis. The safety of empagliflozin in the dialysis patients has not been&#xD;
      established, and thus it is not available for people with end-stage kidney disease. If&#xD;
      empagliflozin is safe in dialysis patients, it may potentially become a very powerful tool to&#xD;
      lower the risk of heart-related complications and prolong survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although empagliflozin is approved by the FDA to treat patients with chronic kidney disease,&#xD;
      heart failure, and/or diabetes, our study will evaluate empagliflozin as an investigational&#xD;
      drug to assess if it is safe in patients receiving chronic dialysis. If we can establish&#xD;
      safety, the next step would be to conduct a larger clinical study to evaluate its ability to&#xD;
      lower heart failure and death risk in dialysis patients.&#xD;
