      This study tests a web-based chronic disease risk reduction intervention among rural adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impact of chronic diseases has important implications for public health presently and in&#xD;
      the future. The prevalence of chronic diseases is expected to rise with subsequent increases&#xD;
      in mortality, morbidity, and health care costs. This proposed pilot project involves testing&#xD;
      an adapted evidence-based health promotion and disease risk reduction curriculum using a&#xD;
      web-based delivery format and determine its impact and efficacy among rural participants. The&#xD;
      project is expected to contribute to improved human health by promoting healthy behaviors&#xD;
      that reduce the development, progression, and exacerbation of chronic diseases.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Produce and Vegetable Consumption from Baseline to Post-intervention and 4 weeks post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention (six weeks from baseline) and 4 weeks post-intervention (10 weeks from baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Theory of Planned Behavior 5-a-day Questionnaire: The 12-item scale for measuring produce consumption had adequate internal reliability for attitudes (Cronbach&quot;s a = .79), norms (a = .77), self-efficacy (a = .81), and intentions (a = .74) when tested among a diverse population. The range of possible scores for each of the subscales for this instrument varied for attitudes (3 to 28), norms and self-efficacy (3 to 21), and intentions (1 to 14).&#xD;
Higher scores indicate greater compliance with dietary recommendations.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Dietary Fat Intake from Baseline to Post-intervention and 4 weeks post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention (six weeks from baseline) and 4 weeks post-intervention (10 weeks from baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Theory of Planned Behavior Dietary Fat Measure: The 14-item instrument containing Likert-type subscales used to ascertain dietary fat attitudes (a = .95), norms (a = .92), self-efficacy (a = .86), and intentions (a = .94) was considered highly reliable. The range of potential scores included 2 items for attitudes (2 to 14), 4 items for norms (4 to 28), 5 items for self-efficacy (5 to 35), and 3 items for intentions (3 to 21).&#xD;
Higher scores indicate greater compliance with following dietary fat recommendations.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Exercise from Baseline to Post-intervention and 4 weeks post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention (six weeks from baseline) and 4 weeks post-intervention (10 weeks from baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Theory of Planned Behavior Exercise Questionnaire: 10-item scale used to measure exercise evidenced good reliability for attitude (α = .84), norms (α = .83), and self-efficacy. (α = .79). Higher scores indicate greater indications of exercise determinants.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Physical Activity from Baseline to Post-intervention and 4 weeks post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention (six weeks from baseline) and 4 weeks post-intervention (10 weeks from baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>International Physical Activity Quesionnaire (IPAQ): Measures physical activities and exercise intensity and time levels, work-related physical activity, transportation-related, etc. (α = .80).&#xD;
Higher scores indicate greater levels of physical activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Health Habits and Knowledge from Baseline to Post-intervention and 4 weeks post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention (six weeks from baseline) and 4 weeks post-intervention (10 weeks from baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Intervention-specific; Diet, exercise, confidence, smoking, alcohol; knowledge of CVD &amp; risk factors. Both scales (Health Habits and Health Knowledge) range from 0-100.&#xD;
Higher scores indicate greater knowledge about health information and performance of those behaviors.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sleep from Baseline to Post-intervention and 4 weeks post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention (six weeks from baseline) and 4 weeks post-intervention (10 weeks from baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI): Sleep habits, Perceptions of sleep quality, quantity, and difficulties falling and staying asleep. 9-item Likert scale had good internal reliability (α = .83).&#xD;
Higher scores indicate better sleep quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Stress from Baseline to Post-intervention and 4 weeks post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention (six weeks from baseline) and 4 weeks post-intervention (10 weeks from baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived Stress Scale: A 10-item, 5-point Likert scale, that had excellent internal consistency (α = 0.84-0.86). The items include perceptions of stress.&#xD;
Higher scores indicate greater perceptions of stress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Social Support from Baseline to Post-intervention and 4 weeks post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention (six weeks from baseline) and 4 weeks post-intervention (10 weeks from baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Interpersonal Support Evaluation List-12 (ISEL-12): Perceived belonging, tangible, and appraisal support. 12-item Likert scale had excellent reliability (α = .90).&#xD;
Higher scores indicate greater social support.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Social Support to Eat Better and Move More from Baseline to Post-intervention and 4 weeks post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention (six weeks from baseline) and 4 weeks post-intervention (10 weeks from baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Social Support to Eat Better and Move More: Support from friends; Overall (α = 0.96); Subscales [informational (α = 0.97), emotional (α = 0.96), and encouragement (α = 0.97)].&#xD;
Higher scores indicate greater social support to eat better and move more.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Well-being from Baseline to Post-intervention and 4 weeks post-intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-intervention (six weeks from baseline) and 4 weeks post-intervention (10 weeks from baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Well-being Scale: Measures well-being (α = 0.92) overall, and five subscales (α = 0.79 - 0.85). Higher scores indicate greater perceptions of personal well-being.</description>
