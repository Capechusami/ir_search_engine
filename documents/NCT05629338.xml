      This study in healthy volunteers is designed to assess the safety of infusing increasing&#xD;
      doses of spray dried plasma (FrontlineODP). Volunteers will have their plasma collected,&#xD;
      spray dried, and then rehydrated for infusion. Volunteers will be infused with their own&#xD;
      (autologous) rehydrated plasma. Cohort 1 will receive 1 FrontlineODP unit that is rehydrated&#xD;
      to approximately 200 mL. Cohort 2 will receive 2 FrontlineODP units of approximately 400 mL.&#xD;
      Cohort 3 volunteers will receive 2 separate infusions of 4 units of approximately 800 mL of&#xD;
      either FrontlineODP (experimental) or frozen plasma (PF24). Order of receipt of plasma&#xD;
      product will be randomized with 14 days between infusion.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study in healthy volunteers (n=24) is designed to assess the safety of infusing ascending doses of reconstituted autologous FrontlineODP in 1, 2, and 4 fixed-dose units. Subjects in Cohort 1 (n = 6) will receive 1 unit of FrontlineODP (Arm 1), which is approximately 200 mL. Subjects in Cohort 2 (n = 6) will receive 2 FrontlineODP units (Arm 2) (total volume of approximately 400 mL). Cohort 3 is a crossover design where subjects (n = 12) will be randomly assigned to receive either 4 units of FrontlineODP followed 14 days later by 4 units of PF24 (Arm 3 - ODPxPF24), or 4 units of PF24 followed 14 days later by 4 units of FrontlineODP (Arm 4 - PF24xODP), where each infusion has a total volume of approximately 800 mL.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>For Cohorts 1 and 2, blinding is not necessary because subjects will only receive a single infusion of FrontlineODP. Cohort 3 subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment sequence and will remain blinded to the study product they receive at each visit. Study participants, the Principal Investigators, the Independent Medical Monitor, and the Data Monitoring Committee will be blinded to the randomization treatment assignments throughout the study.</masking_description>
