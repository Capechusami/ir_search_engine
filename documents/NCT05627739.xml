  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed to test the hypothesis that Mycophenolate Mofetil is clinically&#xD;
      useful for patients with relapse Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approval of the study was obtained from the hospital's ethical committee. The study design&#xD;
      and methodology followed the tenets of Declaration of Helsinki. All patients were provided&#xD;
      with written informed consent and received a thorough explanation of the use of Mycophenolate&#xD;
      Mofetil, its potential risks and benefits. This is a monocenter, cohort, observational study&#xD;
      evaluating patients with relapse VKH divided into two groups: Mycophenolate Mofetil therapy&#xD;
      group and traditional therapy group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Mycophenolate Mofetil therapy group, an initial dose of 0.5-1.0g bid MMF was orally&#xD;
      administered every day, glucocorticoid was started at a dose of 0.5-0.8 mg/kg/day and no more&#xD;
      than 60 mg/day. For the traditional therapy group, patients were treated with glucocorticoids&#xD;
      alone or glucocorticoids combined with Cyclosporine. Study participants will be followed for&#xD;
      up to one year to determine efficacy and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation,&#xD;
      optical coherence tomography (OCT), change in corticosteroid dose during the study period and&#xD;
      so on. The investigators evaluate the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of MMF&#xD;
      in treatment of relapse VKH.&#xD;

    <measure>Change In LogMAR Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) From Baseline to Each Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The participant's best corrected visual acuity was measured using an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) logMAR chart. On the logMAR scale, 0 is equivalent to 20/20 visual acuity, the range of normal vision is considered to be from -0.2 - 0.1; higher values indicate visual impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change in Anterior Chamber (AC) Cell Grade From Baseline to Each Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Slit lamp examinations were conducted at each visit to assess AC cell count. The number of AC cells observed within a 1 mm × 1 mm slit beam was used to determine the grade according to the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria:&#xD;
Grade 0 = &lt; 1 cell Grade 0.5+ = 1 - 5 cells Grade 1+ = 6 - 15 cells Grade 2+ = 16 - 25 cells Grade 3+ = 26 - 50 cells Grade 4+ = &gt; 50 cells.</description>
