    <description>The HighLife TMVR system is composed of a Transcatheter Mitral Valve (TMV), a subannular implant (SAI), and their delivery systems and accessories. The TMV is a 28mm mitral bioprosthesis made of a self-expanding Nitinol frame covered with polyester graft and supporting bovine pericardium leaflets. The bioprosthesis is used in conjunction with the Sub-Annular Implant (SAI), comprising a ring (made of polycarbonate urethane (PCU), nitinol, gold markers and polyester (Dacron) to be placed around the mitral valve apparatus to stabilize the position of the mitral valve implant.</description>

             the primary cause must be treated for at least 1 month after optimal guideline medical&#xD;
             therapy (GDMT). Echocardiography should be performed 3 months after cardiac&#xD;
