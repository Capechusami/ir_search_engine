  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center project aims to quantify the socio-medical costs associated with Unilateral&#xD;
      Spatial Neglect (USN) resulting from acquired brain injury (stroke) and to measure the&#xD;
      effects of USN rehabilitation on functional autonomy, quality of life and psychological&#xD;
      well-being of patients affected by this syndrome, considering the repercussions on a&#xD;
      psychological level and on the quality of life of caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, the experimenters will administer to right brain-injured patients - with&#xD;
      (Experimental Group) or without (Control Group) USN - who undertook a rehabilitation process,&#xD;
      a series of questionnaires: Activities of daily living (ADL), Barthel Index; Instrumental&#xD;
      activities of daily living scale (I-ADL:), the Health Related Quality of Life questionnaire&#xD;
      (EQ-5D-5L), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory&#xD;
      (STAI-Y). The aforementioned tests will be administered before the start of the&#xD;
      rehabilitation (baseline) and after one month, 3, 6 and 12 months after the end of the&#xD;
      rehabilitation. The impact of USN and its treatment on the psycho-physical well-being of the&#xD;
      caregiver will be measured through the Caregiver Burden Inventory questionnaire, which will&#xD;
      be administered with the same timing (baseline, 1-3-6-12 months after rehabilitation). The&#xD;
      costs of USN will be surveyed through an ad-hoc questionnaire, which includes a version&#xD;
      intended for patients and one for caregivers, in order to identify the resources consumed due&#xD;
      to the disease and the expenses taken during the observation period, to be estimated&#xD;
      subsequently in monetary terms (€).&#xD;
