  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adhesive capsulitis (AC), also known as frozen shoulder, is an insidious, painful condition&#xD;
      of the shoulder lasting more than 3 months. This inflammatory condition causing fibrosis of&#xD;
      the glenohumeral joint capsule is accompanied by gradual progressive stiffness and marked&#xD;
      limitation of range of motion (typically external rotation) (1). Patients experiencing this&#xD;
      condition often suffer from poor quality of life due to the limitation of both the active and&#xD;
      passive range of shoulder mobility. The prevalence of frozen shoulder is between 2-5% and is&#xD;
      more common in women. Along with the increase in comorbidities and changes in lifestyle, the&#xD;
      incidence of FS is increasing. However, the natural history and pathogenesis of adhesive&#xD;
      capsulitis have not been widely studied and are still unknown (2) (3). Adhesive capsulitis&#xD;
      presents clinically as shoulder pain with progressive restricted movement, both active and&#xD;
      passive, with normal radiographic scans of the glenohumeral joint. Classically, it progresses&#xD;
      prognostically with 3 overlapping stages: pain (stage 1, lasting 2-9 months), stiffness&#xD;
      (stage 2, lasting 4-12 months), and healing (stage 3, lasting 5-24 months). However, this is&#xD;
      an estimated time frame and many patients may still experience symptoms after 6 years (4).&#xD;
      Treatment modalities include conservative (ie, steroid injection, physiotherapy) and&#xD;
      operative (ie, distension arthrography, manipulation under anesthesia, and arthroscopic&#xD;
      release) (5, 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various physical therapy treatments commonly used in the treatment of adhesive capsulitis&#xD;
      include ice pack, hot pack, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and active and&#xD;
      passive ROM exercises, joint mobilization techniques, proprioceptive neuromuscular&#xD;
      facilitation (PNF), supervised home exercise programs, and Kinesio taping(7 ).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are studies on the application of PNF techniques in proprioceptive neuromuscular&#xD;
      facilitation (PNF), sports injuries, orthopedics, cardiorespiratory and neurological&#xD;
      conditions developed by Knott and Kabat. Recently, the application of these techniques in&#xD;
      orthopedic conditions has been developing. However, studies have been conducted to find out&#xD;
      the effect of PNF therapy on Adhesive Capsulitis, but there is conflicting evidence between&#xD;
      them. Although some studies have suggested PNF, determining which technique is better in the&#xD;
      treatment of AC remains controversial and needs to be answered (8). Therefore, in our study,&#xD;
      it was aimed to compare the effects and advantages of proprioceptive neuromuscular exercises&#xD;
      and shoulder stabilization exercises applied in the treatment of patients with Adhesive&#xD;
      capsulitis and to evaluate the acute effects of these exercises on shoulder movements.&#xD;

    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is used to convert some values that cannot be measured numerically. Two end definitions of the parameter to be evaluated are written at the two ends of a 100 mm line, and the patient is asked to draw a line on this line to indicate where his condition is appropriate.</description>

    <description>During the testing of muscle strength without using any device (&quot;manual muscle testing&quot;), the evaluation system (Medical Research Council (MRC)) scale, which is widely used all over the world, is used. It is the evaluation of motion in the context of gravity.</description>

    <description>The DASH questionnaire consists of 3 parts. The first part consists of 30 questions. 21 questions evaluate the degree of difficulty of the patient in daily activities, 5 questions evaluate the symptomatic features of pain, and 4 questions evaluate social function, self-confidence and sleep.</description>

    <measure>Joint Range of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 3</time_frame>
    <description>A Goniometer is the most common tool for measuring range of motion of the joints of the body. It uses a stationary arm, fulcrum, and movement arm to measure joint angles from the axis of the joint. Making a ROM measurement by using a goniometer requires training for reliable results. See the goniometry collection of pages for instructions on how to correctly (reliably and accurately) place the goniometer when measuring range of motion.</description>
