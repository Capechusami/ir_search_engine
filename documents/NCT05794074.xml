      Ecy of lutein supplementation alone, or zeaxanthin supplementation alone, or a combination of&#xD;
      both, compared to placebo, on the evolution of macular pigment density (MPOD) measured by&#xD;
      fundus photography in XANTH-deficient patients receiving enteral nutrition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lutein and zeaxanthin are plant pigments belonging to the carotenoid family, and more&#xD;
      precisely to the subfamily of xanthophylls (XANTH), which are oxygenated carotenoids. These&#xD;
      phytochemicals are not synthesised by humans and are almost always present in our diet. They&#xD;
      are significantly absorbed and transported in our body. They are present in various organs,&#xD;
      e.g. the eye and the skin. They accumulate in very high concentrations in the central area of&#xD;
      the human retina. Because of this high accumulation, it has been hypothesised that they play&#xD;
      one or more specific roles in the eye. This has been confirmed by several studies which have&#xD;
      shown that XANTHs are involved in protecting the eye from damage by certain light rays (blue)&#xD;
      and age-related macular degeneration. Other studies suggest that XANTH may improve glare&#xD;
      tolerance and contrast sensitivity. They may also improve sensitivity to red and green colour&#xD;
      discrimination. However, identifying the exact relationship between XANTH and visual function&#xD;
      in XANTH supplementation is complicated by two main problems. Firstly, XANTH supplementation&#xD;
      does not always increase MPOD (Macular Pigment Optical Density), which is an indicator of the&#xD;
      concentration of XANTH in the macula, because there are poor responders to XANTH, i.e.&#xD;
      subjects who absorb it very poorly and/or transport it very poorly to the retina. Secondly,&#xD;
      MPOD seems to reach a maximum value and a plateau, and increasing the dose of XANTH, or the&#xD;
      duration of supplementation, does not increase MPOD further. This is particularly the case in&#xD;
      individuals who already have a high MPOD, close to the maximum value, before supplementation&#xD;
      because they often consume XANTH-rich foods, and/or because they are strong responders to&#xD;
      XANTH. Therefore, although studies suggest a specific role for XANTH in visual function, the&#xD;
      problem of initially high MPOD in some individuals, coupled with MPOD saturation, has not&#xD;
      allowed previous studies to provide definitive evidence on their role(s) in visual function.&#xD;
