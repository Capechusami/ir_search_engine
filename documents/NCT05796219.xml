  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer (BC) is the commonest cause of death in young women. Breast screening in women&#xD;
      aged 35-45, at increased risk due to their family history, has been shown to improve&#xD;
      survival. However, 80% of women who develop BC do not have a family history. Numerous studies&#xD;
      have shown that high mammographic density (MD) is one of the strongest risk factors for BC&#xD;
      development. Full field digital mammography (FFDM) can be used to assess MD, however it is&#xD;
      not recommended for population BC screening in those &lt;40 years of age due to the concerns&#xD;
      about the use of ionising radiation. Safe and accurate high throughput methods to quantify MD&#xD;
      in young women are thus required to improve risk prediction and reduce BC mortality. This&#xD;
      study aims to develop a low dose mammogram, with quantification of density using artificial&#xD;
      intelligence, to facilitate high throughput risk assessment in young women. 600 women aged&#xD;
      30-45, previously identified as being at increased risk of BC and attending for annual&#xD;
      mammography at The Nightingale Centre will be recruited. Participants will undergo FFDM of&#xD;
      the right breast as usual, however, following acquisition of the craniocaudal (CC) view, the&#xD;
      breast will remain compressed and the mammogram dose reduced by 90% to deliver a LD&#xD;
      mammogram. This process will be repeated for the right medio-lateral oblique (MLO) view. The&#xD;
      left breast FFDM will proceed as normal. It is estimated that each extra exposure will take&#xD;
      1-2 minutes only. Deep machine learning methods will be used to define the relationship&#xD;
      between standard FFDM views and their low dose counterparts and determine which view (CC vs&#xD;
      MLO) provides the best correlation to be taken forward to the next stage of the research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The more prolonged compression of the breast required to acquire the LD images may cause some&#xD;
      additional breast discomfort. However, in a similar study in The Netherlands only 1% of women&#xD;
      could not tolerate the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive an extra dose of ionising radiation amounting to 20% of the&#xD;
      radiation dose of a single FFDM view (of which 4 are usually taken, 2 on each breast). The&#xD;
      risks associated with this are described in section B and entered into the PIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question for this study is whether an automated, low dose mammogram can be&#xD;
      developed to provide an accurate assessment of mammographic density, and thus breast cancer&#xD;
      risk, in women aged 30-45.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two key objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To develop machine learning methods for automated quantification of mammographic density&#xD;
           using low dose mammograms in a study of 600 women attending for annual Full Field&#xD;
           Digital Mammography (FFDM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To validate Automated Low Dose Risk Assessment Mammography (ALDRAM) against automated&#xD;
           FFDM assessment that has been shown to predict BC risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer is the commonest of all causes of death in young women. Currently the only&#xD;
      factor triggering referral to risk assessment clinics is the presence of a family history.&#xD;
      Although this is known to confer increased risk, only 20% of young women who develop BC&#xD;
      actually have such a family history of the disease. Thus 80% of cases come 'out of the blue'&#xD;
      and methods to assess risk in the general population are required if we are to improve&#xD;
      survival (screening in those at increased risk aged 35-45 has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      mortality). High mammographic density has been shown in multiple studies to confer&#xD;
      significantly increased risk of BC, however population screening with full field digital&#xD;
      mammograms is not recommended in those &lt;40 primarily due to the reduced sensitivity and use&#xD;
      of a moderate doses of ionising radiation. There is thus an urgent need for safe, high&#xD;
      throughput, techniques to accurately define mammographic density in young women - the purpose&#xD;
      of this study. Following consent and initial Case Report Form (CRF) completion, mammography&#xD;
      will commence as standard. The right breast craniocaudal (CC) view will be performed first&#xD;
      and the steps below followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The breast will be positioned as standard for the CC view.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Automatic Optimisation of Parameters (AOPÍ¾ also known as Automatic Exposure Control&#xD;
           (AEC)) will be performed for target, filter, Peak KiloVoltage (kVp) and MilliAmpere&#xD;
           second (mAs) selection for Full Field Digital Mammography (FFDM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The full field CC view will be performed as standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The breast will remain compressed whilst the radiographer manually reduces the mAs by&#xD;
           90% or to the minimum value of 4 mAs (the machine does not deliver less than 4 mAs). No&#xD;
           other parameters will be changed. A repeat CC exposure at this reduced dose will be&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The machine will be reset to automatic and the subsequent mediolateral oblique (MLO)&#xD;
           view will be obtained and the low dose view performed again as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The left breast CC and MLO views will then be obtained as standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. This concludes the woman's participation in the study. The images from the low dose and&#xD;
           FFDMs will then be processed to determine whether mammographic density from low dose&#xD;
           mammograms correlates with that from FFDM and what modifications are required to&#xD;
           automated algorithms for future studies.&#xD;
