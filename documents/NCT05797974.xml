  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose for this research is to create a MyChart-enabled virtual coach that assists obese&#xD;
      patients lose weight prior to ventral hernia surgery. Researchers intend to show how the use&#xD;
      of a virtual coach is more effective in preoperative weight reduction prior to ventral hernia&#xD;
      repair over usual care. Correspondingly, this may lower unplanned hospital readmissions. For&#xD;
      this clinical trial, where randomization is not possible, the study team will implement the&#xD;
      use of propensity score matching that sorts individuals into different study arms as if&#xD;
      randomly assigned. The primary outcome is the average net amount of time-dependent weight&#xD;
      change per group over six months. Secondary outcomes are for the intervention group, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction with the virtual coach and for both groups, quality of life. In addition, areas&#xD;
      of social and economic disadvantage will be identified that may contribute to higher obesity&#xD;
      rates. Machine learning (ML) modeling will be used to determine the important features for&#xD;
      weight lost over the course of the study. The impact of this work will be to demonstrate&#xD;
      efficacy and realized workflow efficiencies within a hospital-based surgery clinic.&#xD;
