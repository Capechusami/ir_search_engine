  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomised, open-label, multicentre clinical trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      superiority of the treatment which foresees the addition of the system VULNOFAST® plus /&#xD;
      VULNOLIGHT® to the Usual Care, versus the treatment with Usual Care alone, for the healing of&#xD;
      chronic diabetic foot ulcer. VULNOFAST® plus is a sterile solution used in combination with a&#xD;
      red light source VULNOLIGHT®. Usual Care is defined as procedures to apply to the foot ulcer,&#xD;
      carried out in the order in which they are listed in the protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the superiority of the treatment which foresees the addition of the&#xD;
      system VULNOFAST® plus / VULNOLIGHT® to the Usual Care, versus the treatment with Usual Care&#xD;
      alone, for the healing of chronic diabetic foot ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive Usual Care and the system&#xD;
      VULNOFAST® plus / VULNOLIGHT®, or Usual Care alone according the following scheme:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: Usual Care alone: 2 times a week (4 treatment weeks, 8 treatments).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: system VULNOFAST® plus / VULNOLIGHT® in addition to Usual Care: both treatments 2&#xD;
           times a week (4 treatment weeks, 8 treatments of Usual Care and 8 treatments of system&#xD;
           VULNOFAST® plus / VULNOLIGHT®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Treatment period will be followed by a Follow up period: the study will last up to 57&#xD;
      days for each patient, including the screening period. Thirteen study visits are planned&#xD;
      starting from the screening and including Treatment and Follow up periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are administered with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid treatment (as background&#xD;
           antibiotic therapy) from Visit 1 until receipt of the antibiogram. Upon receipt of the&#xD;
           antibiogram, the Investigator decides whether or not to continue the background therapy&#xD;
           or to treat the patient with a different antibiotic treatment, according the clinical&#xD;
           practice in the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  use an appropriate off-loading system from Visit 1 to Visit 12&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to assess clinical improvement after 2 weeks of study treatment by&#xD;
      evaluation of the following primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - proportion of patients who had total bacterial load ≤ 1000 CFU/ml at Visit 5 (Visit 5 is&#xD;
      the first visit of 3rd week of treatment), measured by punch biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key secondary objective is also to assess clinical improvement after 4 weeks of study&#xD;
      treatment reflected by the key secondary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - proportion of patients who had a reduction of the target ulcer area ≥ 40% from the baseline&#xD;
      (Visit 1) to the first follow-up visit (Visit 9) after 4 weeks of study treatment, assessed&#xD;
      by MolecuLight i:X medical device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further secondary objectives are evaluated in the study, and a pharmacoeconomic analysis is&#xD;
      foreseen.&#xD;
