  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to see whether long-term electrical stimulation with a&#xD;
      home-stimulation device works well and is safe for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma.&#xD;
      Open-Angle Glaucoma is a disease where the nerves in the back of your eye die off faster than&#xD;
      expected regardless of your eye pressure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a concurrent open-label study for patients who are deemed safe to participate in the&#xD;
      electrical stimulation trial but do not fit the exact criteria for the randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant must be at least 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant must has the ability to comply with the requirements of the study and&#xD;
             complete the schedule of events (SOE).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant's clinical diagnosis must be consistent with glaucoma characterized by the&#xD;
             following features: Mean deviation (MD) worse than -3 on Humphrey Visual Field 24-2&#xD;
             testing. Reliable visual field measures, fixation losses do not exceed 20% and false&#xD;
             postivies do not exeed 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. In the opinion of the investigator the participant's eye pressure must be clinically&#xD;
             stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If a participant has two eyes meeting study criteria, the worse eye as determined by&#xD;
             mean deviation. If both eyes qualify and have the same MD, the patient may choose&#xD;
             which eye they are willing to enter, or else a randomization procedure will assign one&#xD;
             eye to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participant must understand and sign the informed consent. If the participant's vision&#xD;
             is impaired to the point where he/she cannot read the informed consent document, the&#xD;
             document will be read to the participant in its entirety.&#xD;

             study procedures, evaluations and outcome assessments. Including but not limited to&#xD;
             all forms of dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Unresected brain tumors&#xD;

             clamps, coils, ventriculo-peritoneal shunts, endoprostheses, etc.), which are not&#xD;
             MRI-compatible. Note: metallic dental implants and titanium screws or plates are&#xD;
             acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients with any skin damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Children and comatose patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Participant is not able to travel, to comply with the requirements of the study or not&#xD;
             willing to complete the schedule of events (SOE) and/or unable to confirm follow-up&#xD;
             participation&#xD;
