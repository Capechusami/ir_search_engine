  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A bivalent Typhoid and Paratyphoid A conjugate investigational vaccine aimed to prevent both&#xD;
      typhoid and paratyphoid enteric fever in infants and older age groups has been developed by&#xD;
      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this first-time-in-human study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity&#xD;
      profile of a low and a full dose of the investigational vaccine, formulated with or without&#xD;
      adjuvant, administered in 2 doses, 24 weeks apart, in healthy adults 18 to 50 years of age in&#xD;
      Europe.&#xD;
