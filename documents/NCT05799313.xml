    <textblock>
      For women undergoing percutaneous nerve evaluation (PNE) for the treatment of overactive&#xD;
      bladder the first step is the PNE interstim therapy trial. If the PNE works, patients may opt&#xD;
      to have the interstim procedure. The purpose of this study is to see if patients who remove&#xD;
      their PNE lead at home have the same satisfaction with the PNE trial as those women who have&#xD;
      their lead removed in the office.&#xD;

      Study Identification and Recruitment: Potential subjects will be identified by members of the&#xD;
      Center for Urogynecology &amp; Pelvic Reconstructive Surgery at the Cleveland Clinic Main campus,&#xD;
      Hillcrest Hospital, Medina Hospital, and Fairview Hospital. Eligible patients who agree to&#xD;
      participate will be provided written informed consent administered by the collaborators&#xD;
      listed on this IRB. Enrollment and consent will take place either at the time of office&#xD;
      consultation prior to the procedure or virtually before the procedure using DocuSign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Randomization will occur prior to PNE placement. Subjects will be randomized&#xD;
      to either in-office versus at-home removal of the PNE lead. Randomization will be done&#xD;
      according to a computer-generated randomization schedule with the use of the SAS statistical&#xD;
      software package (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Subjects and research personnel will not be&#xD;
      blinded to group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: PNE will be performed in a standard fashion with the patient placed in a flat&#xD;
      prone position. Her lower back will be prepped with antiseptics and she will be draped in&#xD;
      sterile fashion. Her coccyx is identified and an area 9cm cephalad to this point will be&#xD;
      marked with a pen. A line is then drawn 2 cm bilaterally in a horizontal fashion and points 2&#xD;
      cm cephalad to these points will also be marked to estimate the skin entry point for access&#xD;
      into the S3 foramen. Local anesthesia (1% lidocaine) will be infiltrated bilaterally in the&#xD;
      marked areas. The PNE kit is opened and the foramen needle is inserted at an approximately 60&#xD;
      degree through one of the marked sites, entering the presumed S3 foramen. The S3 foraminal&#xD;
      location is confirmed with any of the following responses: levator ani motor response&#xD;
      (perirectal bellows), plantar flexion of the ipsilateral great toe, and/or patient report of&#xD;
      perineal sensation. A second foramen needle is then placed on the contralateral side, 4 cm&#xD;
      away from the first needle, also at a 60-degree angle, into the S3 foramen. Foraminal&#xD;
      location is again confirmed with any of the following responses: levator ani motor response&#xD;
      (perirectal bellows), plantar flexion of the ipsilateral great toe, and/or patient report of&#xD;
      perineal sensation. Once the S3 foraminal location is confirmed, the stylets are removed and&#xD;
      the temporary leads are placed. The leads are tested bilaterally and if similar responses are&#xD;
      obtained bilaterally the procedure is complete. The temporary leads are then taped securely&#xD;
      to the skin with Tegaderm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PNE Lead Removal: Patients will complete the trial within 3 to 7 days of the PNE lead being&#xD;
      placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Home Removal: Patients will receive a phone call day of removal by study personnel and&#xD;
      they will be guided over the phone on how to remove the lead in real time. If there is any&#xD;
      question of complete lead removal, they will be asked to upload a picture of their lead to&#xD;
      their MyChart or they will text a picture of it to a Cleveland Clinic encrypted mobile phone&#xD;
      belonging to one of the study personnel. Confirmation of complete lead removal will be made&#xD;
      and documented in the patient's electronic medical record. If there is any concern that the&#xD;
      lead was not removed entirely, the patient will be asked to come into the office for a visit&#xD;
      and they will bring the removed lead with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Office Removal: The temporary lead will be removed in the office at a scheduled visit by&#xD;
      study personnel. Confirmation of complete lead removal will be documented in the patient's&#xD;
      electronic medical record.&#xD;
