  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) refers to a group of malignant tumors derived from non-epithelial&#xD;
      extraosseous tissues, mainly from the mesoderm, partly from the neuroectoderm, including&#xD;
      muscle, fat, fibrous tissue, blood vessels and peripheral nerves . STS is divided into 12&#xD;
      major categories based on tissue origin. According to different morphologies and biological&#xD;
      behaviors, there are more than 50 subtypes. The most common subtypes include:&#xD;
      undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), liposarcoma (LPS), leiomyosarcoma (LMS), synovial&#xD;
      sarcoma ( SS). The most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents is&#xD;
      rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Soft tissue sarcoma is a group of highly heterogeneous tumors, which&#xD;
      are characterized by local invasiveness, invasive or destructive growth, local recurrence and&#xD;
      distant metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathological features of STS that occur in the nasal cavity and sinuses are similar to&#xD;
      other parts of the body. However, because it can affect important structures such as the&#xD;
      orbit, optic nerve, skull base bone, dura mater, cranial nerve and even brain tissue, the&#xD;
      diseased site is deep, the anatomical structure is complex, the treatment is difficult, the&#xD;
      range of surgical resection is limited, and the surgical margin Negative is difficult to&#xD;
      guarantee, and related treatments may have obvious complications, which affect the survival&#xD;
      and prognosis of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment is the most important and most likely effective treatment for STS. With&#xD;
      the development of endoscopic skull base anatomy and surgical techniques, the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of endoscopic sinus surgery for the treatment of nasal cavity and sinus tumors&#xD;
      have been fully confirmed, and it has become the main surgical method for nasal cavity and&#xD;
      sinus STS. This is also the theoretical and practical basis for the feasibility of this&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intends to conduct a single-arm, prospective, observational study of endoscopic&#xD;
      sinus surgery for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma of the nasal cavity and paranasal&#xD;
      sinuses to explore the therapeutic effect and complications of endoscopic surgery for the&#xD;
      treatment of soft tissue sarcoma of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, and explore its&#xD;
      relationship with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The model of comprehensive treatment&#xD;
      between.&#xD;

      between.This study is divided into a screening period, a treatment period, and a follow-up&#xD;
      period. All subjects need to sign an informed consent form before screening, perform relevant&#xD;
      blood tests, imaging examinations, and compare the inclusion and exclusion criteria to select&#xD;
      suitable patients to enter the treatment period. The follow-up period is 5 years.&#xD;
