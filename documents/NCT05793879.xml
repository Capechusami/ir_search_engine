  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aphasia is an acquired deficit following acute damage to the central nervous system that&#xD;
      involves the difficulty or impossibility of understanding and formulating language. A typical&#xD;
      disorder of non-fluent forms of aphasia is anomia. Anomia refers to the difficulty in finding&#xD;
      words, in particular when trying to name objects and actions. According to the Embodied&#xD;
      Cognition approach (EC), language is tightly connected to the motor system. In this view,&#xD;
      language rehabilitation programs should stimulate language through the activation of the&#xD;
      motor system. In this approach, since anomic deficits are often due to a weak link between&#xD;
      the meaning of the word and its lemma, the Hebbs' principles of coincident and correlated&#xD;
      learning can be exploited, i.e., by intensifying the synchronous activation of lexicon and&#xD;
      semantics and connecting them with the motor counterpart. In this study, the investigators&#xD;
      present an innovative training, based on the EC framework, in which they will make use of new&#xD;
      technologies for anomia rehabilitation in post-stroke patients. Specifically, the researchers&#xD;
      will use immersive 360° videos representing everyday actions displayed from the first-person&#xD;
      point of view, experienced through a head-mounted display. The training will be administered&#xD;
      3 times a week for 4 weeks. The control group will watch standard videos representing the&#xD;
      same actions recorded from the third-person perspective. Naming abilities will be tested&#xD;
      before and after the training together with other cognitive and psychological measures. The&#xD;
      investigators expect that the group who will undergo the 360° video-based training will show&#xD;
      greater improvement of performance compared to the control group.&#xD;

    <measure>Batteria per l'Analisi dei Deficit Afasici (BADA), naming subtest</measure>
    <time_frame>post treatment, 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>It is an Italian validated neuropsychological battery aiming at testing all the language abilities. It includes several tests tapping into the different linguistic abilities, but for the purpose of the present study only the verb and object naming subtest will be administered. Higher scores indicate greater naming abilities</description>

    <measure>EuroQol Health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-3L)</measure>
    <time_frame>post treatment, 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The test consists of 2 sections. The first one is made of 5 questions scored from 1 to 5 points each. The final score ranges from 5 to 15, where the lesser the better. The second section is a visual scale on which the best state the patient can imagine is marked 100 and the worst state is marked 0.</description>

    <measure>Functional Outcome Questionnaire (FOQ-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>post treatment, 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The survey is administered to the caregiver. It includes 32 questions each scored from 1 to 5 points. The final scores ranges from 32 to 160, where higher scores indicate greater communication abilities</description>
