  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motorized traction and non-surgical spinal decompression treatments are relatively new&#xD;
      treatments for which there is insufficient evidence in the literature. In this study&#xD;
      investigators aimed to retrospectively compare the effectiveness of these treatments, which&#xD;
      are in the field of their routine practice in their clinic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. People with physically&#xD;
      demanding jobs, physical and mental comorbidities, smokers, and obese individuals are at&#xD;
      greater risk for low back pain. Anatomical structures that potentially nociceptive&#xD;
      contributors to low back pain are intervertebral discs, facet joints, and vertebral end&#xD;
      plates. It has been determined that nonsurgical treatments are clinically effective in&#xD;
      reducing pain and functional improvement in patients with lumbar disc herniation. However,&#xD;
      the level of evidence has generally not been highly evaluated, which can be attributed to the&#xD;
      paucity of well designed randomized controlled trials. Despite moderate evidence, exercise&#xD;
      and traction are recommended. In this study investigators aimed to retrospectively compare&#xD;
      the effectiveness of these treatments, which are in the field of their routine practice in&#xD;
      their clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      01.01.2019-10.11.2022. Investigators planned to examine the records of patients aged 20-75&#xD;
      years who underwent physical therapy with the diagnosis of lumbar discopathy in AFSU FTR&#xD;
      Department Physical Therapy Unit. Investigators planned to examine the routine anamnesis&#xD;
      examination, treatment card and control evaluation records of the patients made in the FTR&#xD;
      outpatient clinic from the automation system of their hospital.&#xD;

    <measure>Visual Pain Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Pain Scale (VAS), which is easy to understand, apply and interpret, provides valid and reliable data in a short time, is the most used method in clinics. With a visual linear scale of 100 mm, the patient is told that there is no pain at the 0 point, and the most severe pain ever felt in life at the 100 point, and the patient is asked to put a mark on the point corresponding to his or her pain.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index was first described in 1980. The questionnaire consists of 10 items addressing different aspects of the function. Each item was scored from 0 to 5, with higher values representing greater disability. The total score is multiplied by 2 and expressed as a percentage. Turkish validity and reliability have been demonstrated.</description>
