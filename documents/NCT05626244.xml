  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial aims to test the efficacy of an early parenting intervention&#xD;
      for childhood behavior problems in the portuguese community. More specifically, this research&#xD;
      intends to: 1) examine the effects of the parenting intervention in childhood behavior&#xD;
      problems, positive parenting skills and parental concerns; 2) test participants' adherence,&#xD;
      acceptability and dropout rates of the parenting intervention; and 3) qualitatively analyze&#xD;
      the experience of parents' who received the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will compare an intervention group with a waitlist control group to see if there&#xD;
      are any significant differences between these groups regarding childhood behavior problems&#xD;
      and the aforementioned parenting dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both groups will be able to participate in the parenting intervention that&#xD;
      has a duration of 9 weeks. Furthermore, they will be asked to fill in pre and post data.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Being a Parent</intervention_name>
    <description>Being a Parent (BaP) is a group parenting intervention for parents of children (2-11 years old) with behavioral problems. It consists of 2-hour sessions facilitated by psychologists for between 8-12 parents. Based on attachment, family systems, and cognitive-behavioral theories, BaP successfully integrates knowledge acquisition, behavior change with adult learning and social support. Each course session is highly interactive involving an engaging blend of small and large group discussion, role play, demonstrations, information sharing and reflection. This enables parents to practice and use new skills to achieve specific goals (Day et al., 2020).</description>
