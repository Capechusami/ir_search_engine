  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young adults aged 18-26 engage in a number of behaviors that increase their risk of&#xD;
      developing cancer later in life including sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy eating, nicotine&#xD;
      produce us, heavy drinking of alcohol, increased UV exposure, and incomplete uptake of HPV&#xD;
      vaccination. A multi-risk factor campaign will be developed to reduce these cancer risk&#xD;
      behaviors and delivered to young adults over social media, a popular channel that can reach&#xD;
      nearly all young adults. The campaign will be evaluated for effectiveness in a rigorous&#xD;
      randomized trial with measures of moderate to vigorous physical activity, healthy eating&#xD;
      patterns, nicotine product use, alcohol intake, sunburn prevalence, and HPV vaccination&#xD;
      uptake.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several risk factors are prevalent during early adulthood that can lead to cancer later in&#xD;
      life. Emerging adults (EAs) aged 18-26 residing in rural areas of the United States engage in&#xD;
      many cancer risk behaviors, especially sedentary lifestyles, poor eating patterns, nicotine&#xD;
      product use, excess alcohol intake, infrequent sun protection, and inadequate uptake of the&#xD;
      HPV vaccine. This application responds to RFA-CA-20-051, &quot;Social and Behavioral Intervention&#xD;
      Research to Address Modifiable Risk Factors for Cancer in Rural Populations.&quot; The goal is to&#xD;
      improve cancer risk behavioral factors among diverse EAs aged 18-26 living in rural counties&#xD;
      in the Four Corners states, a unique, underserved region, using a social media campaign&#xD;
      designed with community advisors. EAs, including in rural communities, are heavy consumers of&#xD;
      online content, especially over social media, and social media provide responsive, engaging,&#xD;
      and low-cost platforms for distributing cancer prevention information with high dissemination&#xD;
      potential. But, social media also circulate inaccurate, misleading, and harmful information.&#xD;
      The specific aims of this research are to: 1) Develop a social media intervention for diverse&#xD;
      EAs in rural communities via a community-engaged process that combines expert advice,&#xD;
      user-generated content, and online instruction to communicate about behavioral cancer risks,&#xD;
      cancer misinformation, counter marketing, digital and media literacy, and family&#xD;
      communication; 2) evaluate the effect of a theory-based social media intervention on moderate&#xD;
      to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), healthy eating patterns, nicotine product use, alcohol&#xD;
      intake, sunburn prevalence, and HPV vaccination with the diverse population of EAs aged 18-26&#xD;
      in rural counties in AZ, CO, NM, and UT (Four Corners states) recruited from Qualtrics'&#xD;
      survey panel and enrolled in a pragmatic randomized trial using a stepped-wedge design in&#xD;
      which individual EAs will be randomized to 1 of 4 cohorts and receive the social media feed&#xD;
      for varying durations in separate Facebook private groups; 3) test if improvements in EAs'&#xD;
      cancer risk knowledge and beliefs, digital and media literacy skills, accurate cancer&#xD;
      prevention information, and family communication mediate impact of the social media campaign;&#xD;
      and 4) explore whether the impact of the social media campaign differs according to: a) level&#xD;
      of EAs' engagement with campaign, b) cancer risk factors, and c) biological sex of the&#xD;
      participants (as required by NIH). The research is innovative because it tests a&#xD;
      theory-based, multi-risk factor approach to cancer prevention with diverse EAs in rural&#xD;
      counties, an under-studied population, in a very popular new media. Social media may reach&#xD;
      EAs more than interventions through other community channels (e.g., clinics, schools, and&#xD;
      workplaces) and for lower cost in the geographically-dispersed, underserved rural communities&#xD;
      in the Mountain West. The overall impact is extremely high because it will aid rural EAs in&#xD;
      making informed decisions that reduce cancer risk factors and prevent cancer later in life&#xD;
      and help EAs critically evaluate and resist misinformation and marketing that promote cancer&#xD;
      risk behaviors.&#xD;
