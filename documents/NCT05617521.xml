  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of an&#xD;
      abdominal binder use during colonoscopy performed by gastrointestinal endoscopy fellow&#xD;
      trainees. The investigators hypothesized that the abdominal binder use would facilitate and&#xD;
      increase the effectiveness of the colonoscopy for inexperienced operators.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It will be a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study. The trial will be performed at&#xD;
      a single-center, Hospital Central Norte PEMEX, a tertiary center with a gastrointestinal&#xD;
      endoscopy fellow trainee program with more than 10 years of experience. This trial will be&#xD;
      conducted in accordance with the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki. The&#xD;
      trial has been approved by the local ethical committee and research committee with the number&#xD;
      DCAS-SSS GSM-HCN-INV-0043-2022. Written informed consent will be obtained from all the&#xD;
      patients before participation. This manuscript will be reported in accordance with CONSORT&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the procedure, age, sex, height, weight, waist circumference (WC), body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI), and colonoscopy indication of all participants will be recorded. Once enrolled,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to either the abdominal binder (AB) group or the sham binder (SB)&#xD;
      group in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be performed using a web-based computer system&#xD;
      (Research Randomizer, Geoffrey C. Urbaniak and Scott Plous) by an independent statistician&#xD;
      who had no other intervention in the study. An independent operator will print the&#xD;
      randomization number and group for each participant (either the AB or SB group) in individual&#xD;
      cards, which will be hidden in a locked black box by the same independent operator. Only the&#xD;
      nurse, who will fit the abdominal binder to all the patients in a private space, will have&#xD;
      access to the cards. Randomized data and cards will be concealed to study coordinators,&#xD;
      endoscopists, clinical staff, and participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The abdominal binder to be used for the patients allocated in the AB group was the Revive&#xD;
      3-in-1 Postpartum Recovery Support Belt (KeaBabies® Co., CA, USA). Its price is $29.96. The&#xD;
      device is manufactured in two sizes, One Size and X-Large. For the patients with a waist&#xD;
      circumference &gt;110 cm it will be used the X-Large model. The three belts that make up the&#xD;
      binder will be fitted to all the participants. Once placed, the binder will be adjusted to be&#xD;
      located between the subcostal border and the anterior superior iliac spine. The participants&#xD;
      will be asked to confirm that the binder is fastened tightly but not uncomfortably. For the&#xD;
      participants in the SB group the same binder will be fitted, but once the patient is sedated,&#xD;
      it will be loosened by the same nurse. The participants will wear a non-transparent gown over&#xD;
      the binder so that it will not be visible to the endoscopists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bowel preparation with 4 L of polyethylene glycol solution in split-dose (2 L in the&#xD;
      afternoon of the day before and 5 h before the colonoscopy) will be used in all the&#xD;
      participants. In this trial, all colonoscopy procedures will be performed by two second-year&#xD;
      fellow trainees in gastrointestinal endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard video-colonoscope (EC-3890Li, PENTAX Co., Tokyo, Japan) will be used. All the&#xD;
      patients will be placed in the left lateral decubitus position. Manual abdominal compression&#xD;
      and postural change will be conducted by a technician when required by the endoscopy trainee&#xD;
      or the attending endoscopist. Endoscopist or anesthesiology will be allowed to remove the&#xD;
      binder at any time during the procedure if they resolve it was necessary for safety. Air&#xD;
      insufflation will be used during colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was estimated over the primary outcome of the study based on pre-experimental&#xD;
      data estimation and previously reported CIT and SD of similar studies with fellows'&#xD;
      participation. It was calculated that 142 participants were needed to detect a 60-second&#xD;
      difference in CIT (SD 110 sec), with 90% power and two-side alpha 0.05. Moreover, it was also&#xD;
      calculated based on the frequency of ancillary maneuvers, using pre-experimental data&#xD;
      estimation and literature data. It was found that 186 participants (93 per group) were needed&#xD;
      to detect a 20% reduction in the use of ancillary maneuvers, with 90% power and two-side&#xD;
      alpha 0.05. As a preventive measure in case of withdrawal or exclusion, the sample was&#xD;
      expanded by 10%, a total of 206 patients, 103 in each group were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistical analysis, including mean, mode, and frequencies will be performed for&#xD;
      the description of the study data. The comparative analysis of the quantitative data will be&#xD;
      previously subjected to normality evaluation by the Shapiro-Wilk test and graphical analyses.&#xD;
      According to the normality, data comparative analysis will be performed either with a two-way&#xD;
      Student's test or U Mann-Whitney test. For the comparative analyses of the categorical data&#xD;
      (e.g., manual abdominal compression, postural change, need for intervention by the attending&#xD;
      endoscopist) will be used chi-square or Fisher' exact test. A p value of &lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      accepted as statistical significance. Statistical inferential analysis will be performed&#xD;
      using RStudio® (R Core Team v.1.2.5033; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,&#xD;
      Austria) and SPSS® Statistics for Windows Version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). RStudio®&#xD;
      (R Core Team v.1.2.5033) will be also used for drawing graphics. The study biostatistician&#xD;
      (SA) will be blinded to the randomization phase and recollection data process.&#xD;
