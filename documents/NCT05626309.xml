    <textblock>
      This study include a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo, parallel controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial.The randomized clinical trial will enroll approximately 310 patients.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly divided into experimental (n=155) and placebo groups&#xD;
      (n=155).Patients in the experimental group was treated with Qizhu Yuling prescription within&#xD;
      6 months after esophagus cancer R0. Patients in the control group will receive the&#xD;
      placebo.The primary endpoint is 1-year DFS (Disease-free survival) rate after surgery, that&#xD;
      refers to the proportion of patients who do not have recurrence, metastasis or death (from&#xD;
      any cause) within 1 years after surgery. The research protocol was approved by the relevant&#xD;
      ethics committees, and the study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Patients gave written informed consent to participate in&#xD;
      the trial.&#xD;
