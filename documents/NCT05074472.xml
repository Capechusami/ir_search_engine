    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-human, Phase 1, open label, multicenter, dose escalation study with&#xD;
      expansion at the RP2D, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      ZB131 in patients with solid tumors where prevalence of CSP expression is high. Approximately&#xD;
      12 to 24 patients will be enrolled in the Dose Escalation Stage; the total number of patients&#xD;
      will depend on the dose level at which the RP2D is defined. Patients who meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria during Screening will enter the treatment period. ZB131 will be given via IV every&#xD;
      week. Patients will be treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities occur.&#xD;

      This study is a first-in-human, Phase 1, open label, multicenter, dose escalation study with&#xD;
      expansion at the RP2D, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      ZB131 in patients with solid tumors where prevalence of CSP expression is high. Approximately&#xD;
      12 to 24 patients will be enrolled in the Dose Escalation Stage; the total number of patients&#xD;
      will depend on the dose level at which the RP2D is defined. Patients who meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria during Screening will enter the treatment period. ZB131 will be given via IV every&#xD;
      week. Patients will be treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the RP2D has been established, the Dose Expansion stage will begin to enroll subjects by&#xD;
      cohort. For each expansion cohort, subjects will be enrolled in two stages. The first stage&#xD;
      includes an evaluation of 12 patients. If 1 or more of 12 patients have a CR or PR, then&#xD;
      accrual will continue until a total of 37 patients with measurable disease have been&#xD;
      enrolled. Additional patients may be added to ensure 37 subjects with measurable disease are&#xD;
      available for evaluation&#xD;

          5. Patients must have a tumor lesion that can be safely biopsied and agree to provide a&#xD;
             fresh or archival tissue sample prior to treatment initiation and agree to an&#xD;

&#xD;
             Note: Anti-coagulation therapy is allowed, if this treatment canpermitted but should&#xD;
             be able to be interrupted for a biopsy as judgedif deemed necessary by the&#xD;
             Investigator).. The coagulation parameters for patients on anti-coagulation will be&#xD;

             pregnancy test must be obtained within 72 hours before first treatment. WCBP should be&#xD;
             placed on effective birth control directly after testing negative for pregnancy; if&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to Screening. Major surgery is any invasive&#xD;
             operative procedure in which a more extensive resection is performed, e.g. a body&#xD;
             cavity is entered, organs are removed, or normal anatomy is altered. In general, if a&#xD;
             mesenchymal barrier is opened (pleural cavity, peritoneum, meninges), the surgery is&#xD;
             considered major. Minimally invasive (laparoscopic) procedures are not considered&#xD;
             major surgery, unless considered high risk and requiring extended (greater than over-&#xD;
             night observation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment. Patients must have&#xD;
             recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not require corticosteroids for their&#xD;
             radiation therapy, and no history of radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is&#xD;
             permitted for palliative radiation (≤2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-central nervous&#xD;
             system disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Anti-cancer therapy, such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted&#xD;
             therapy, or investigational agents within five half-lives or four weeks, whichever is&#xD;
             shorter, prior to administration of the first dose of study treatment. Hormonal&#xD;
             therapy as maintenance when there is no evaluable cancer is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active CNS metastases; however, patients who have undergone radiation and/or surgery&#xD;
             for the treatment of CNS metastases, who are neurologically stable, and who are no&#xD;
             longer taking pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids are eligible; patients with&#xD;
             leptomeningeal metastases are not eligible.&#xD;

&#xD;
             i. Note: Patients should remain on antiviral therapy throughout study intervention and&#xD;
             follow local guidelines for HBV antiviral therapy post completion of study&#xD;
             intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             ii. Hepatitis B screening tests are not required unless:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Known history of HBV infection, 2. Mandated by local health authority. b.c. Patients&#xD;
        with a history of hepatitis C virus infection are eligible if HCV viral load is&#xD;
