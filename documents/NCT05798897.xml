    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1multicenter study with a Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion evaluating&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of MT-601 administration to patients with Relapsed or Refractory NHL. The&#xD;
      dose administered is 200 x 10^6 cells (flat dosing).&#xD;

      This study is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of MT-601 in patients with relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who&#xD;
      either received CD19+ chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy or are ineligible for&#xD;
      CD19+ CAR T cell therapy. The study will consist of two portions: 1) Dose Escalation (3+3&#xD;
      design) followed by 2) Dose Expansion. The purpose of the Dose Escalation portion of the&#xD;
      study is to test safety and tolerability of higher doses of MT-601 up to 400 x 106 cells. The&#xD;
      Dose Expansion portion of this study will begin after completion of the Dose Escalation&#xD;
      portion. The purpose of the Dose Expansion portion of the study is to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of MT-601 at the dose determined to be safe in the Dose Escalation portion.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All applicable inclusion and exclusion criteria must be met at Screening and at&#xD;
