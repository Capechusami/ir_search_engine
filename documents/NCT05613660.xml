      A proof of science clinical study with randomized, four-arm, comparative, single-blind,&#xD;
      within the arm - Dose-Response Study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of different&#xD;
      collagen peptide-containing test treatments in adult human subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose response will be evaluated for the effectiveness of each test treatment in three&#xD;
      different dosages that is 2.5 g Versus 5 g Versus 10 g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      22 subjects will be enrolled per dose per test treatment to complete 20 subjects per dose per&#xD;
      test treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are four different test treatments as mentioned below will be tested during study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test Treatment A: VEGCOL™️ (Veg Collagen Peptide)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test Treatment B: PROCOL (Bovine Collagen Peptide)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test Treatment C: AQUACOL (Fish/Marine Collagen Peptide)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test Treatment D: CALCOL (Chicken Collagen Peptide) Mode of Usage: 1 scoop/sachet of&#xD;
           daily Route of Administration: Oral Administration with a glassful (approx. 250 mL) of&#xD;
           water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering proof of science study, a sufficient number of adult subjects with an age group&#xD;
      of 30 - 50 years old (i) having mild to moderate crows' feet wrinkles near to eye area and&#xD;
      (ii) mild to moderate joints pain, swelling, stiffness and decreased range of motion (iii)&#xD;
      having complaints of hair fall, decreased hair growth, brittle nails will be&#xD;
      recruited/enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Bovine Arm, out of 66 subjects, a few subjects with osteoarthritis patients having present&#xD;
      complaints of pain and stiffness in joints will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collagen peptides effects of all 4 variants will be evaluated in enrolled subjects with&#xD;
      mild to moderate acne.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential subjects will be screened as per the inclusion &amp; exclusion criteria only after&#xD;
      obtaining written informed consent from the subjects. The subjects will be instructed to&#xD;

      makeup during study visits to the facility. The study will be conducted in four different&#xD;
      groups considering four different arms of test treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of safety and efficacy parameters will be done before test treatment usage on Day&#xD;
      1, and will be compared with after test treatments usage on Day 10 (+2 Days), Day 30 (+2&#xD;
      Days), and Day 60 (+2 Days) within treatments and between treatments, between three dosages&#xD;

    <description>Mode of Usage: 1 scoop/sachet daily Route of Administration: Oral administration with a glassful (approx. 250 mL) of water&#xD;
VEGCOL helps in providing the necessary nutrition needed for the body to produce collagen. Vegan collagen gives a lighter feel on consumption compared to any other collagen and increases the elasticity of the skin and makes skin supple. VEGCOL has more amino acids than animal derived Collagen which makes it very ideal to consume not only in Vegetarian populated countries like in India but around the world. Pepsin, a digestive enzyme, is added to help structure the building blocks into collagen molecules with the exact structure of human collagen.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Chicken collagen is used to treat joint pain associated with many types of arthritis and surgery, as well as back pain, neck pain, and pain following injury. Chicken collagen works by causing participants' body to produce substances that fight inflammation and pain. It also contains chondroitin and glucosamine, two compounds that help rebuild cartilage. That's why chicken collagen can provide some amazing benefits for participants' gut, immune system, skin, and more.&#xD;
