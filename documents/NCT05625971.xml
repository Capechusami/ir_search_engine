  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the sensitivity and accuracy of non-invasive MRD&#xD;
      assessment using liquid biopsy (blood draw) and functional imaging (whole body MRI) in&#xD;
      participants with new diagnosed and previously treated multiple myeloma. The long-term goal&#xD;
      of this study is to investigate whether non-invasive methods for MRD assessment can replace&#xD;
      bone marrow aspiration and biopsy in a substantial percentage of participants with multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an unmet clinical need for an easier, non-invasive, and reliable method to perform&#xD;
      MRD assessments that can be used in clinical trials and routine practice. The two&#xD;
      non-invasive modalities that are most promising for MRD assessment are liquid biopsy to&#xD;
      detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and functional imaging to detect focal myeloma lesions.&#xD;
      However, there are no prospective data on the sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive MRD&#xD;
      assessment with respect to the gold standard of bone marrow sampling.&#xD;
