&#xD;
          -  Untreated brain metastases. Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if&#xD;
             they show no evidence of progression and are off steroids or on stable/decreasing&#xD;
             steroid dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
             biologic composition to ATI-2231 or other agents used in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known HIV are eligible unless their CD4+ T-cell counts are &lt; 350&#xD;
             cells/mcL or they have a history of AIDS-defining opportunistic infection within the&#xD;
             12 months prior to registration. Concurrent treatment with effective ART according to&#xD;
             DHHS treatment guidelines is recommended.&#xD;
