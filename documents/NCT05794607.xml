    <textblock>
      As a result of the review in the literature, no study was found in which tele-pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation was applied after physiotherapist-supervised lung resection via video&#xD;
      conferencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, it was planned to investigate the effectiveness of tele-pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation in patients diagnosed with lung cancer and undergoing lung resection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Research; It was planned as a prospective and randomized controlled study. The research&#xD;
      universe is Istanbul Kartal Dr. Lütfi Kırdar City Hospital Chest Surgery Clinic will consist&#xD;
      of cases with a preliminary diagnosis of lung cancer. The sample of the study, on the other&#xD;
      hand, will consist of patients who agreed to participate in the study and who met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, who were planned for lung resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study group (n=18); The treatment features of the tele-pulmonary rehabilitation group&#xD;
           via videoconferencing are; Within the scope of the tele-pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
           program, an exercise program consisting of lower-upper extremity strengthening training&#xD;
           and flexibility training, breathing exercises training (diaphragmatic breathing,&#xD;
           thoracic expansion exercises and forced expiration) and aerobic exercise training will&#xD;
           be created before discharge, exercise session will be followed. Re-evaluation will be&#xD;
           done after 8 weeks.Exercise intensity will be planned as 2 days a week with supervision&#xD;
           and 1 day without supervision, 3 days a week in total. Exercise safety will be ensured&#xD;
           by taking the severity of shortness of breath of the patients as a reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group (n=18); Patients in the tele-pulmonary rehabilitation control group will&#xD;
           be given respiratory and aerobic exercise advice before discharge. Re-evaluation will be&#xD;
           done after 8 weeks.&#xD;
