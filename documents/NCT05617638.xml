  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial to analyze the perceived impact of the virtual reality intervention&#xD;
      on the experience of pain and well-being, and the influence on vital signs and the&#xD;
      relationship with the length of stay in the intensive care unit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The highly specialized and complex technology used in intensive care units to provide&#xD;
      continuous monitoring of the patient health context makes possible to increase the survival&#xD;
      of patients with critical and unstable clinical status, but increases the triggering factors&#xD;
      of the stress of hospitalized patients. Staying in these therapy units is accompanied by&#xD;
      additional stress, confusional mental states, cognitive dysfunction, and depression. Virtual&#xD;
      reality is a technique that involves the use of computer technology to create the effect of&#xD;
      an interactive three-dimensional world in which objects have a spatial presence reducing the&#xD;
      suffering related to a medical procedure, without side effects and without the need for&#xD;
      additional personnel. Actual exposure to nature can be difficult to achieve for patients&#xD;
      admitted to intensive care. Therefore, exposure to nature via media devices, and virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR) is considered a promising technology due to its advantage in creating a sense of&#xD;
      immersion. Furthermore, some evidence indicates that virtual nature can improve attentional&#xD;
      resources, cognitive performance, and pain experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial aims to analyze the influence of VR use in patients of Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit (ICU). After informed the consent form, participants will be randomly into control and&#xD;
      intervention groups. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation will be&#xD;
      evaluated, in addition to the experience of well-being and pain immediately before and&#xD;
      immediately after the intervention for 2 consecutive days.The hypothesis of the study is that&#xD;
      VR will positively influence vital signs and lived experiences, which will consequently&#xD;
      reduce the length of stay in the ICU.&#xD;

    <description>Will be applied the Visual Analogue Scale - VAS. It is one of the most used instruments for pain assessment with a score from 0 to 10 that allows the patient to evaluate the pain of the procedure through a visual analogue scale numbered from zero to ten, with zero no pain, ten being the worst pain ever felt in life.The scale will be applied immediately after the first day (D1) of intervention using Virtual Reality and immediately after the second day (D2).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Affective States pos intervention.</measure>

    <description>Will be applied the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule - PANAS. It is one of the most used instruments in the investigation of affective states composed of 20 questions and each item can be rated on a likert type frequency scale of sensations, raging from 0 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). The questionnaire will be applied immediately after the first day (D1) of intervention using Virtual Reality and immediately after the second day (D2).</description>
