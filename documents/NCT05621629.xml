  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The posterior sagittal approach to anorectal malformation (ARM) has radically changed the&#xD;
      outcome of these patients, improving the preservation of anal sphincters, owing to their&#xD;
      anatomical identification. However, in long term follow-up, fecal incontinence and severe&#xD;
      constipation remain the most frequent and disabling postoperative clinical problems, having a&#xD;
      significant influence on quality of life. Current therapeutic measures for Fecal Incontinence&#xD;
      include biofeedback, sacral nerve stimulation, radiofrequency energy delivery, surgical&#xD;
      treatment and sphincter replacement. Biofeedback combined with SNS has achieved satisfactory&#xD;
      results. However, not all patients have an improvement in their weakened anal sphincter and&#xD;
      achieve acceptable continence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed assessment of anorectal sphincter morphology and function can predict therapeutic&#xD;
      outcome. Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) can help to judge the anal atresia type, to display&#xD;
      the presence and running of the fistula, and to show the nature of anal sphincter, such as&#xD;
      the shape, thickness, directions and position of the anal sphincter complex and location in&#xD;
      the pelvic floor and other systems malformations, finally to provide a reliable diagnostic&#xD;
      basis for surgical program and prognostic assessment. High-resolution anorectal manometry&#xD;
      (HR-ARM) is the latest internationally recognized examination for the evaluation of anorectal&#xD;
      function. A standardised protocol of HR-ARM can characterise FI from dyssynergic or other&#xD;
      neuromuscular and sensory problems. As a result, HR-ARM provides a more appropriate&#xD;
      management in patients with FI. In order to assess whether patients with fecal incontinence&#xD;
      should choose biofeedback therapy, our study included children with FI after anorectal&#xD;
      malformation, and combined HR-ARM and MR to predict the efficacy of sacral nerve stimulation&#xD;
      and pelvic floor rehabilitation.&#xD;

      The posterior sagittal approach to anorectal malformation (ARM) has radically changed the&#xD;
      outcome of these patients, improving the preservation of anal sphincters, owing to their&#xD;
      anatomical identification. However, in long term follow-up, fecal incontinence and severe&#xD;
      constipation remain the most frequent and disabling postoperative clinical problems, with an&#xD;
      important impact on quality of life. A cluster of physical and psychological problems appear&#xD;
      in pediatric patients, including repeated infections, skin ulcer and scar, social anxiety&#xD;
      disorder, behavioral problems, self-abasement or isolation and other problems, which cause&#xD;
      children full of guilt and embarrassment and increase the risk of bullying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current therapeutic measures for FI include biofeedback, sacral nerve stimulation,&#xD;
      radiofrequency energy delivery , surgical treatment, and sphincter replacement. Zhengwei Yuan&#xD;
      et al. conducted a follow-up study on 31 patients with FI after ARM, and confirmed that&#xD;
      biofeedback combined with SNS has a good effect on patients with FI after ARM. However,not&#xD;
      all patients improve their impaired anal sphincter and acquire satisfactory continence. A lot&#xD;
      of time and treatment costs are wasted. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the indications&#xD;
      for the application of biofeedback combined with SNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity of ARM affects the degree of development of internal and external anal sphincters. A&#xD;
      detailed assessment of anorectal sphincter morphology and function can predict therapeutic&#xD;
      outcome. In clinical practice, endoanal ultrasound and endoanal magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) are the main imaging modalities for the anatomical assessment of the anal sphincter&#xD;
      complex. Sphincter MR is more suitable for observing the nature of the anal sphincter such as&#xD;
      the shape, thickness, directions, and position of the anal sphincter complex and its location&#xD;
      on the pelvic floor. MR examination has a high clinical value in the diagnosis of ARM. It can&#xD;
      help determine the anal atresia type, display the presence and running of the fistula,&#xD;
      evaluate the perianal muscle development and other systems' malformations, and finally&#xD;
      provide a reliable diagnostic basis for surgical program and prognostic assessment. The role&#xD;
      of MR is similar to that of EUS in some aspects. However, the sphincter MRI can clearly&#xD;
      demonstrate the sphincter pattern, the position of the sphincter on the pelvic floor, and&#xD;
      several indicators that cannot be detected by EUS. High-resolution anorectal manometry&#xD;
      (HR-ARM) is the latest internationally recognized examination for the evaluation of anorectal&#xD;
      function. A standardised protocol of HR-ARM can characterise FI from dyssynergic or other&#xD;
      neuromuscular and sensory problems.Therefore, HR-ARM provides a more appropriate management&#xD;
      in patients with FI. The anorectal manometry is a functional study that can evaluate the&#xD;
      potential for muscular sphincterial recovery after BFB; the assessment derives greater&#xD;
      benefit also from a morphological evaluation (MRI) in particular when the manometry is&#xD;
      unfavorable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included children with FI after ARM, and the investigators combined HR-ARM and MR&#xD;
      to predict the efficacy of sacral nerve stimulation and pelvic floor rehabilitation to&#xD;
      determine whether patients with fecal incontinence should choose biofeedback therapy.&#xD;
