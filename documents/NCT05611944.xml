  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted on women with risk factors for SSI assigned to gynecological&#xD;
      surgery with an open abdominal approach. The participants will be designated to either&#xD;
      Irrigation and suction arm by bilateral drain insertion or the control arm by randomization&#xD;
      through the parallel assignment. The participants will be followed for the outcome for four&#xD;
      days in the hospital and then at 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks postoperatively. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measure will be the SSI rate. Secondary outcomes will be signs of SSI, post-operative&#xD;
      pain, other complications and patient satisfaction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will be carried out in Lady willingdon Hospital, Lahore. In this study, we will&#xD;
      recruit middle-aged and elderly diabetic women who have been assigned to open abdominal&#xD;
      hysterectomy due to different gynaecological reasons. This cohort is at great risk of&#xD;
      surgical site infection and other risk factors of SSI like hypertension, hepatitis and&#xD;
      malignancy may coexist in these women. The study period will span to include three hundred&#xD;
      participants as calculated according to sample size. The women will be divided into either an&#xD;
      I&amp;S group or a control group by a simple random number container method. The women in the I&amp;S&#xD;
      group will be inserted with bilateral drains during surgery in subcutaneous tissue after the&#xD;
      closure of the rectus sheath and irrigated with saline followed by suction through syringe&#xD;
      suction attached to the wound for rest of the day. The procedure will continue for three&#xD;
      days. On the fourth day, drains are removed and stitches are removed on the fourth&#xD;
      postoperative day. In the control group, the wound will be closed by interrupted stitches&#xD;
      without the insertion of subcutaneous drains. The dressing will be done daily for seven days.&#xD;
      patients with no symptoms and signs of SS will be sent home on the eighth postoperative day.&#xD;
      The patients will be followed for symptoms of SSI, pain, readmission rate, and other&#xD;
      complications at 4,8 and 12 weeks.&#xD;
