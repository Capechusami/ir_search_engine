    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to adapt Cognitive Muscular Therapy so that it can be used&#xD;
      to manage chronic low back pain. A secondary aim is to understand the potential therapeutic&#xD;
      benefit of this intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that people with chronic low back pain (LBP) demonstrate muscle&#xD;
      overactivity during functional tasks when compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, this&#xD;
      increased activity of the low back and trun, muscles has been associated with increased&#xD;
      sensitivity to pain. It has also been shown that people with chronic LBP exhibit alterations&#xD;
      in functional movement patterns and postures when compared to healthy people. Such&#xD;
      alterations may be a direct result of increased stiffness in the spine which results from&#xD;
      muscle overactivity. Psychosocial physiotherapy techniques for LBP are gaining widescale&#xD;
      acceptance. However, these approaches are often combined with strengthening exercises, and&#xD;
      not specifically aimed at reducing muscle overactivity. Therefore, there is a need for&#xD;
      research into interventions for chronic LBP which integrate psychologically informed practice&#xD;
      with training to reduce muscle overactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a new treatment for people with knee osteoarthritis, known&#xD;
      as Cognitive Muscular Therapy (CMT). CMT is a form of psychologically informed physiotherapy&#xD;
      which uses biofeedback training to reduce muscle overactivity and therefore lower the&#xD;
      mechanical stress on the knee. CMT is delivered through five sequential intervention&#xD;
      components and teaches patients to think and respond differently to pain, to improve postural&#xD;
      control and to perform functional movements, such as walking, with less muscle tension. See&#xD;
      the dedicated website for further details&#xD;
      (https://hub.salford.ac.uk/cognitive-muscular-therapy/). Given the strong focus on postural&#xD;
      control, the investigators are confident that CMT can be adapted and used to treat other&#xD;
      chronic musculoskeletal conditions, such as LBP. In this project, the investigators will map&#xD;
      changes to the five CMT intervention components. The intervention will then be delivered to&#xD;
      patients with chronic low back pain, after which the investigators will seek to understand&#xD;
      participant perceptions of the new treatment.&#xD;
