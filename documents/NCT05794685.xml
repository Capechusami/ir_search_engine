  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee surgeries are associated with severe postoperative pain. Improper pain management&#xD;
      affects patients' psychological status with prolongation of hospital stay time and&#xD;
      rehabilitation period, with the possibility of progression of the acute pain to chronic pain&#xD;
      (McCartney CJ, Nelligan K., 2014). Many Pain management options following these surgeries are&#xD;
      available: non-opioid analgesics, opioids and regional anesthesia techniques (epidural and&#xD;
      peripheral nerve block). Multi-modal analgesia is considered the best option for pain&#xD;
      management in knee surgeries. As non-opioid analgesics alone are not effective enough while&#xD;
      opioids alone are associated with many risk factors: nausea, vomiting, decrease intestinal&#xD;
      motility and respiratory depression with possibility of addiction (Goode VM, Morgan B, et al,&#xD;
      2019)&#xD;

      Knee surgeries are associated with severe postoperative pain. Improper pain management&#xD;
      affects patients' psychological status with prolongation of hospital stay time and&#xD;
      rehabilitation period, with the possibility of progression of the acute pain to chronic pain&#xD;
      (McCartney CJ, Nelligan K., 2014). Many Pain management options following these surgeries are&#xD;
      available: non-opioid analgesics, opioids and regional anesthesia techniques (epidural and&#xD;
      peripheral nerve block). Multi-modal analgesia is considered the best option for pain&#xD;
      management in knee surgeries. As non-opioid analgesics alone are not effective enough while&#xD;
      opioids alone are associated with many risk factors: nausea, vomiting, decrease intestinal&#xD;
      motility and respiratory depression with possibility of addiction (Goode VM, Morgan B, et al,&#xD;
      2019). Regarding the functional anatomy of the nerve supply to knee joint: The knee is&#xD;
      innervated by genicular branches from the nerve to vastus medialis, saphenous nerve, sciatic&#xD;
      nerve and the posterior division of obturator nerve. The skin around the knee is supplied by&#xD;
      the cutaneous branches from the femoral nerve and the saphenous nerve (Ritesh Roy, Gaurav&#xD;
      Agarwal, et al, 2018). The widespread use of ultrasound to advance peripheral nerve block&#xD;
      techniques over the past decade has led to enormous growth in the utilization and efficiency&#xD;
      of regional anesthesia (Cozowicz, Crispiana &amp; Poeran, et al, 2015). The adductor canal block&#xD;
      (ACB) is an interfascial plane block performed in the middle third of the medial side of the&#xD;
      thigh. The adductor canal bounded anteriorly by the sartorius muscle, posteriorly and&#xD;
      medially by the adductor longus and magnus muscles, and laterally by the vastus medialis&#xD;
      muscle. It contains the femoral vein and artery, the saphenous nerve and the nerve to the&#xD;
      vastus medialis, both are sensory branches of the femoral nerve. In some individuals, the&#xD;
      obturator sensory branch (also a femoral nerve branch) can be affected by local anesthetic&#xD;
      infiltration into this area. It can be noted that this block affect sensory branches and&#xD;
      avoid blocking the majority of motor branches. The block is most commonly performed using&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance (Thiayagarajan MK, Kumar SV,et al 2019). Ultrasound guided 4-in-1 block&#xD;
      technique: a new single injection technique described by Roy R, Agarwal G, et al, 2018 for&#xD;
      the combined 4 nerves (saphenous nerve, obturator nerve, nerve to vastus medialis and sciatic&#xD;
      nerve) with a single injection point is located at the adductor hiatus where descending&#xD;
      genicular artery branches from superficial femoral artery. Bupivacaine is a long-acting amide&#xD;
      local anesthetic (max. dose 2.5 mg/kg). Symptoms contributed to local anesthetic toxicity&#xD;
      include tinnitus, perioral tingling, visual disturbances and dizziness (Shafiei FT,&#xD;
      McAllister RK, Lopez J, 2022)&#xD;

    <description>Postoperative pain score: resting and dynamic pain using NRS at postoperative 6 hours.Numerical rating scales (NRSs) are the simplest and most commonly used scales. The numerical scale is most commonly 0 to 10, with 0 being &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 being &quot;the worst pain imaginable.&quot; The patient picks (verbal version) or draws a circle around (written version) the number that best describes the pain dimension, usually intensity.</description>
