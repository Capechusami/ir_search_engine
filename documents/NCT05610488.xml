      Title: Intravitreal faricimab in diabetic macular edema with limited response to aflibercept&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The purpose of this investigator initiated study is to identify the effects of&#xD;
      intravitreal faricimab on recurrence-free treatment intervals and morphological features in&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema (DME) in which the Optical coherence tomography (OCT) guided treatment&#xD;
      interval failed to be extended to 6 weeks intervals in a treat and extend regimen using&#xD;
      aflibercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective is to evaluate the proportion of patients with an increased&#xD;
      maximum treatment interval with intravitreal faricimab (compared to previous 4-week interval&#xD;
      under aflibercept) in an OCT guided treat and extend regimen at month 6 and 12. (for further&#xD;
      outcome measures see section Objectives)&#xD;

      Title: Intravitreal faricimab in diabetic macular edema with limited response to aflibercept&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study purpose: The purpose of this investigator initiated study is to identify the effects of&#xD;
      intravitreal faricimab on recurrence-free treatment intervals and morphological features in&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema (DME) in which the Optical coherence tomography (OCT) guided treatment&#xD;
      interval failed to be extended to 6 weeks intervals in a treat and extend regimen using&#xD;
      aflibercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The primary objective is to evaluate the proportion of patients with an increased&#xD;
      maximum treatment interval with intravitreal faricimab (compared to previous 4-week interval&#xD;
      under aflibercept) in an OCT guided treat and extend regimen at month 6 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mean maximum treatment interval with intravitreal faricimab at month 6 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of treatments applied during the 12 months study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mean change in BCVA (Best Corrected Visual Acuity) from baseline (=switch to&#xD;
           faricimab) to month 6 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the mean BCVA at baseline (=switch to faricimab) and month 6/12 in patients&#xD;
           with extended treatment intervals under faricimab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mean change in CS (Contrast Sensitivity) from baseline (=switch to faricimab) to&#xD;
           month 6 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mean change in AllEye index (metamorphopsia index) from baseline (=switch to&#xD;
           faricimab) to month 6 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mean change in central retinal thickness as measured in the central ETDRS ( Early&#xD;
           Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) subfield from baseline (=switch to faricimab) to&#xD;
           month 6 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the incidence of qualitative OCT features like intraretinal fluid, subretinal&#xD;
           fluid, and hyperreflective foci between baseline (=switch to faricimab) and month 6 and&#xD;
           12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients achieving a dry retina at month 6 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The mean changes in FAZ (foveal avascular zone) area and vessel density as measured by&#xD;
           OCT-Angiography (OCTA) from baseline (=switch to faricimab) to month 6 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The change in quality of life (VFQ-25 scores) from baseline to 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to 4weekly dosing of faricimab in DME by&#xD;
           determining the rates of adverse events and serious adverse events at 6 and 12 month&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: This outpatient study population will consist of a representative group of male&#xD;
      and female patients ≥ 18 years of age suffering from DME with a treatment interval of 4 weeks&#xD;
      under aflibercept. All patients are pre-treated with intravitreal aflibercept for at least 6&#xD;
      months in a treat and extend regimen. For In-/Exclusion criteria see section Eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size will be 30. This is a pilot study investigating faricimab in pretreated&#xD;
      aflibercept high demanders with DME using a real-life like treat and extend schema. So far&#xD;
      this population has not been investigated with faricimab. In the context of recent market&#xD;
      approval in Switzerland a timely start of the study to generate prospective data in this&#xD;
      population with the highest treatment burden is recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consenting, enrolled patients will receive an intravitreal injection of faricimab 6 mg at&#xD;
      baseline (week 0), at week 4, 8, 12 (=4x loading) and each of the following treat and extend&#xD;
      visits. From visit 4 (week 12) onwards extension of treatment intervals is possible&#xD;
      2-week-stepwise, e.g. 4, 6, 8 weeks etc. Starting at week 12 at each visit the next treat and&#xD;
      extend interval (and so the exact date of the next visit) will be defined depending on the&#xD;
      following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Presence of any DME activity including:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - sub- and/or intraretinal fluid within the central ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic&#xD;
           Retinopathy Study) subfield and/or ETDRS inner ring&#xD;
&#xD;
           → new treatment interval = last treatment interval reduced by 2 weeks but minimum&#xD;
           interval is 4 weeks, which means 4 weeks interval stays at 4 weeks, 6 weeks interval is&#xD;
           reduced to 4 weeks etc&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. No signs of DME activity:&#xD;
&#xD;
           → new treatment interval = last treatment interval plus 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If there was 2 times a recurrence at a certain interval, in this patient the treatment&#xD;
           interval stays at the 2 weeks lower interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy assessment at 3 months is within loading phase; for efficacy assessments after 6, 9&#xD;
      and 12 months a treat and extend visit which takes place within 2 weeks before/after (meaning&#xD;
      24±2 weeks, 36±2 weeks and 48±2 weeks, respectively) can replace an extra assessment visit as&#xD;
      far as the required examinations are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spectral-domain Optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) at each study visit from baseline&#xD;
           through month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measurements using the ETDRS-testing charts at a&#xD;
           testing distance of 4m following ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study)&#xD;
           refraction protocol at baseline, week 4, month 3, 6, 9 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contrast sensitivity measurement at baseline, week 4, month 3, 6, 9, 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AllEye metamorphopsia measurement (self-test) at baseline and at each study visit from&#xD;
           baseline through month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Swept-source OCT-Angiography at baseline, month 3, 6, 9, 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography (FA) at baseline and month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life questionnaires VFQ-25 at baseline and month 6 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ophthalmic examinations (slit lamp exam, fundus ophthalmo-scopy, Intraocular pressure&#xD;
           (IOP) by applanation tonometry)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Color fundus photography at baseline and month 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs: heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events (ocular and non-ocular)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Product / Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include the following drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Faricimab (Vabysmo®) 6 mg solution for intravitreal injection The drug is supplied as a&#xD;
      sterile liquid for intravitreal injection in single-use glass vials (commercial product as&#xD;
