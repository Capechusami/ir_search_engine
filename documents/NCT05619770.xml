  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this interventional study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and&#xD;
      tolerability of 101-PGC-005 in healthy, adult, human subjects. The main question it aims to&#xD;
      answer is what are the single and multi-dose PK properties of 101-PGC-005 in the systemic&#xD;
      circulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a bolus injection of 101-PGC-005 administered intravenously once&#xD;
      daily for 3 consecutive days. Blood and urine samples will be collected at predetermined&#xD;
      timepoints for analysis.&#xD;
