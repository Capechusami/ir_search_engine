  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and age-related vascular&#xD;
      dysfunction is considered the key process linking the two. Middle age is a particularly&#xD;
      vulnerable period when risk factors exceed diagnostic thresholds and clinical expression of&#xD;
      CVD first becomes evident. Ultra-processed foods (UPF) comprise almost 60% of total energy in&#xD;
      the standard American diet. The results of observational studies suggest that UPF consumption&#xD;
      increases CVD risk, independent of overall diet quality (i.e., saturated fat, sodium, sugar,&#xD;
      and dietary fiber intake). The &quot;industrialized microbiota&quot; may link diet, particularly UPF,&#xD;
      to increased inflammation and CVD in middle-aged adults. High intake of UPF increases the&#xD;
      likelihood of an excess heart age &gt;10 years and doubles the risk of subclinical coronary&#xD;
      atherosclerosis in middle-aged adults. However, the impact of reducing UPF consumption on&#xD;
      vascular function in middle-aged adults is unknown. The overall objective of this study is to&#xD;
      establish proof-of-concept for an improvement in vascular function following reductions in&#xD;
      UPF consumption in mid-life adults, in order to conduct a larger, more comprehensive and&#xD;
      mechanistic trial in the future. In addition, changes in gut microbial composition and&#xD;
      function, intestinal inflammation and permeability, serum endotoxin concentrations, and&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines as potential mechanisms by which UPF consumption influences vascular&#xD;
      function will be investigated.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in brachial artery function from baseline to 6-weeks post no or standard UPF diet</measure>
    <time_frame>30-minute measurement in the laboratory, 2 timepoints (baseline, 6 weeks post no or standard UPF diet)</time_frame>
    <description>Flow Mediated Dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery will be assessed using duplex ultrasonography (GE Logiq e) with a high-resolution linear array transducer. Reactive hyperemia will be produced by inflation of a pediatric BP cuff around the forearm for 5 minutes. Offline analysis of baseline and post-reactive hyperemic diameters and velocities will be performed using edge detection software (Vascular Analysis Tools, Medical Imaging Applications, Inc). Endothelium independent vasodilation (EID) will be assessed by measuring brachial arterial dilation for 10 minutes following administration of 0.4 mg of sublingual nitroglycerine. Both FMD and EID will be expressed as mm and % change from baseline diameter.</description>
