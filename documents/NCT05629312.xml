  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effect of 3 randomly applied interceptive measures (slow&#xD;
      maxillary expansion, extraction of deciduous canines and no intervention) on maxillary canine&#xD;
      impaction in patients with early mixed dentition and lack of space in the dental arch.&#xD;
      Additionally, these groups are compared with a control group with adequate space. Patients&#xD;
      with at least one impacted maxillary canine, presence of deciduous canines and absence of&#xD;
      crossbite were included. The canine position is assessed by measuring five variables (sector&#xD;
      of the canine cusp, canine to midline angle, canine to first premolar angle, canine cusp to&#xD;
      midline distance, and canine cusp to maxillary plane distance) on 2 panoramic radiographs at&#xD;
      0 (T1) and 18 months (T2).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients presenting at the intake consultation of the Department of Orthodontics&#xD;
             of University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium from September 2016, with at least one&#xD;
             maxillary permanent canine impaction are invited to participate. Canine impaction is&#xD;
             diagnosed based on a panoramic radiograph, taken for standard evaluation of dental&#xD;
             development and associated pathology. A maxillary canine is considered to be impacted&#xD;
             when the canine to midline angle was ≥15° (Alqerban et al. 2014; Warford et al. 2003).&#xD;
             Only impacted maxillary canines with incomplete root formation and with persisting&#xD;
             deciduous canines are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  presence of uni- or bilateral posterior dental crossbite,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  upper permanent canines showing root malformation, ankylosis or fully erupted,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  evidence of root resorption of adjacent teeth, previous orthodontic treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  craniofacial syndromes,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  systemic disease that would impede orthodontic treatment/surgery and recent exposure&#xD;
             to radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  large eruption follicles seen on the permanent canines&#xD;
