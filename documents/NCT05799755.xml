  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will evaluate safety and how well the study drug, nintedanib improve&#xD;
      symptoms in participants with myositis associated interstitial lung disease (MA-ILD).&#xD;
      Interstitial lung disease is a disorder caused by the abnormal accumulation of cells&#xD;
      structures between air sacs of the lungs resulting in thickening, stiffness and scarring of&#xD;
      the tissues of the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll a total of 134 participants across 15 clinical sites located in the&#xD;
      United States. A subset of participants will be enrolled remotely via telemedicine utilizing&#xD;
      certified mobile home research nurses and various remote monitoring devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research visits may include a physical exam, vital signs (such as blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate, etc.), pulmonary function tests (PFT and/or home spirometry), Computerized Tomography&#xD;
      (or CT) scans of the chest, blood draws, wearing a physical activity monitor and completing&#xD;
      questionnaires. Some of these events may be done at home, at a local facility or remotely&#xD;
      (via telemedicine).&#xD;

      Participants enrolled in the study will receive either study drug or placebo for 12 weeks&#xD;
      plus the participant's normal standard of care medication for the participant's disease.&#xD;
      Placebo is an inactive substance that contains no medicine. Following the initial treatment&#xD;
      phase, participants will receive the active study drug (nintedanib) for an additional 12-week&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nintedanib is a drug that is currently used and has been approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and has been&#xD;
      shown to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function among patients with IPF as well as&#xD;
      interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with systemic sclerosis or scleroderma. In&#xD;
      addition, in March 2020, the FDA approved nintedanib oral capsules to treat patients with&#xD;
      chronic fibrosing (scarring) interstitial lung diseases (ILD) with a progressive phenotype&#xD;
      (trait).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Randomization will be 1:1 for nintedanib: placebo and stratified by underlying immunosuppressive therapy (mycophenolate vs. others). All patients must be on the standard of care (SOC) immunosuppression (IS) at screening as per the protocol and should remain on stable doses throughout the trial. After 12 weeks both arms will receive an additional 12 weeks of nintedanib (150 mg twice a day, maximum dose of 300 mg a day) through week 24 (final study visit).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Living with Pulmonary Fibrosis (L-PF) questionnaire is a 44 item questionnaire with two modules: Symptoms (23 items) and Impacts (21 items).&#xD;
The Symptoms module yields three domain scores: 1) dyspnea, 2) cough and 3) fatigue as well as a total Symptoms score. The Impacts module yields a single Impacts score. Symptoms and Impacts scores are summed to yield a total L-PF score. Scoring is performed as a summary score, the mean of the dimension ratings multiplied by 100. Summary score range from 0-100, the higher the score the greater the impairment.</description>
