  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spot reduction, referring to local body fat reduction, pertains to subcutaneous adipose&#xD;
      tissue utilization from specific body parts during exercise. Its existence has been keenly&#xD;
      debated, although generally accepted not to occur during exercise. However, it is based on&#xD;
      not only equivocal data - commonly the training protocol typically applied is based on&#xD;
      strength rather than endurance training. The investigators sought to test this assumption by&#xD;
      utilizing endurance based exercise controlling for energy expenditure and using dual x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometric measures to assess body composition before and after training.&#xD;
