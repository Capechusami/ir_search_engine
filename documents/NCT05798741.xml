  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankle fractures account for 10 % of fractures in the adult population. A part of patients&#xD;
      (40%) is treated surgically. After healing of the fractures, about one year after the&#xD;
      operation, a surgery is often performed to remove the hardware in order to diminish pain. If&#xD;
      this surgery is necessary is debated in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to evaluate the outcome of hardware removal surgery after a surgery&#xD;
      of the ankle for a fracture. For that, we will perform do a controlled randomized trial with&#xD;
      two arms: one arm includes the participants who will have a hardware removal and the other&#xD;
      arm will not have a surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parameters are the patients reported outcome and pain related disability. They will&#xD;
      be assessed by the questionnaires FAAM score (Foot and Ankle Ability Measure) and PDI (Pain&#xD;
      Disability Index) at the beginning and at the end of the study, at six months. The third&#xD;
      outcome parameter will be the complication rate after an anklehardware removal surgery, which&#xD;
      will be assessed through the Ernst-Ssink classification.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a prospective multicentric parallel two-arm randomised non-blinded&#xD;
      study, conducted at the HFR and RHNe (level of evidence II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned intervention is the following: after an ORIF of the ankle, patients have a&#xD;
      follow-up. At the 12- month control, we ask eligible patients if they want to participate to&#xD;
      the study. If they agree, they are randomised to treatment recommendations in one of two&#xD;
      groups: conservative or surgical. The patients may follow or not the recommendations; not&#xD;
      following the recommendations does not exclude them from the study. Patients of both groups&#xD;
      will fill out FAAM and PDI questionnaires at 12 and 18 months after the 1st operation.&#xD;
      Patients in the surgical group will have a hardware removal surgery. It is a very common&#xD;
      operation consisting of hardware removal that is done ambulatory by the orthopaedic surgeons&#xD;
      specialized in foot and ankle surgery. Operated patients will have the usual postoperative&#xD;
      follow-up (6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months postoperative) and all complications will be&#xD;
      recorded and classified according to the Ernst-sink classification&#xD;
