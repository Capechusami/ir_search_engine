  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to create a methodological framework, including the discovery and&#xD;
      validation of novel biomarker panels to decipher the impact of plant-based protein intake on&#xD;
      health biomarkers. Moreover, the possibility of predicting biomarkers production will be&#xD;
      tested by a colonic in vitro fermentation study using study participants' faecal samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of a double-blind, randomised, 3-arm parallel trial, consisting of 2-wk&#xD;
      baseline measurements, 4-wk intervention period (with weekly sample collection), and 2-wk&#xD;
      after-intervention follow-up, with healthy subjects in each arm consuming different protein&#xD;
      sources (from plant- or animal-based sources). Subjects that are eligible to take part in&#xD;
      this study will be blinded and randomly allocated to consume an isolated pea protein (arm 1),&#xD;
      animal protein (arm 2) or more complex protein pea protein powder (arm 3). The isolated plant&#xD;
      and animal protein will be used to evaluate the specific effects of the proteins from the&#xD;
      different sources. The more complex protein pea protein powder will be used as a more complex&#xD;
      food matrix, containing other food components than protein, to assess how other pea&#xD;
      components may impact the specific protein effects. Regardless of the differences in their&#xD;
      structure, all supplement powders will be adjusted to provide the same amount of protein. The&#xD;
      protein calculation will be done exclusively for each participant, based on their body weight&#xD;
      (kg). They will consume up to 2 g of protein per body weight per day. Subjects will be asked&#xD;
      to maintain their usual diet and their food intake will be accompanied during the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants' compliance will be followed by their food diaries and by clinical markers for&#xD;
      protein intake and will collect blood, faeces and 24 h urine samples. A subset of the&#xD;
      participants (max. 15 per arm) for visits 2 and 6 will be invited to participate in a&#xD;
      postprandial challenge. After the fastening blood sample collection, they will receive the&#xD;
      daily protein portion as breakfast. For those, 9 blood sample time points will be taken,&#xD;
      being at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 480 min. After the 180 min measurement, they&#xD;
      will receive a standard meal as lunch (e.g., pasta with tomato sauce).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Healthy male and female adult subjects (n=87) will be recruited to take part in a double-blinded, randomized, 3-arms parallel trial. Subjects that are eligible to take part in the study will be blinded and randomly allocated to consume an isolated plant protein (arm 1) or isolated animal protein (arm 2) or plant-based source of protein (arm 3). The subjects eligible to take part in this study will consume the proteins for 4 weeks, before the intervention they will have a baseline of two weeks, and after the intervention, they will have more two visits. Faecal and blood samples will be used to answer the main outcome of gut-related metabolites and microbiota profile. Blood and urine samples will be used to measure health status and compliance (protein intake markers). Questionnaires will be used to access gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel movement, physical activity level and dietary intake.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in faecal metabolites depending on the protein supplementation amount and from colonic in vitro fermentation. Targeted and untargeted metabolomics measurements will be used (e.g., short-chain fatty acids and branched chain fatty acids analyses, and polar and non polar metabolomics). Faecal samples will have their metabolites extracted and quantified by liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-qToF-MS), and gas chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectroscopy (GC-Orbitrap). The level of metabolites will be compared throughout the whole study.</description>
