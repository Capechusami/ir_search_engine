  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is only limited data for premenopausal patients in general, as well as for differences&#xD;
      in the use of OFS in the subgroups of pre- and perimenopausal patients, respectively. The WSG&#xD;
      ADAPT trial data on the impact of postmenopausal status and/or use of OFS within 3-4 weeks&#xD;
      endocrine induction therapy show relevant impact of OFS/postmenopausal status on Ki-67&#xD;
      response; also, secondary amenorrhea after (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy was a positive&#xD;
      predictor of outcome due to OFS [8, 9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registry will give insights in the real-world use of OFS and the effect of secondary&#xD;
      amenorrhea in female pre- and perimenopausal patients with or without previous use of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and with different endocrine treatments (ET +/- GnRH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As adherence over time (5-10 years) plays a major role in the endocrine treatment, the&#xD;
      registry will follow patients' treatments for up to 10 years and include QoL information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of MammaPrint® (MammaPrint® Index) as indicating factor for chemotherapy use and risk&#xD;
      classification, thus, choice of adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy, OFS combined with endocrine&#xD;
      therapy, or endocrine therapy alone) will be correlated to outcome under real-world&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline, treatment, and relapse data shall be collected to gain further insight in the&#xD;
      treatment paths, treatment adherence, and outcome of such patients.&#xD;

      This registry aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to confirm an excellent outcome in pre-/perimenopausal patients treated by endocrine&#xD;
           therapy (+ ovarian suppression) in patients with low genomic risk by MammaPrint® without&#xD;
           chemotherapy use in a real-world setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate management of ovarian function in patients treated by adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
           according to investigator decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate adherence to endocrine therapy (+/- ovarian function suppression).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the prognostic impact of clinicopathological markers (e.g., estrogen&#xD;
           receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2 receptor, Ki-67 at baseline and after&#xD;
           preoperative endocrine therapy (if any performed) by local pathology assessment compared&#xD;
           to genomic signature result.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the course of quality of life (QLQ BR23 and QLQ-C30) until 5 years of&#xD;
           treatment with OFS (Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 2 years, 3&#xD;
           years, 4 years, 5 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, WSG aim to assess the quality of surveillance care in younger breast cancer&#xD;
      patients. WSG want to gain knowledge about endocrine induction treatment for indication of&#xD;
      chemotherapy followed by endocrine treatment or endocrine treatment alone. Also, WSG aim at&#xD;
      changes in duration of endocrine treatment (especially in high-risk patients up to 10 years)&#xD;
      and introduction of intensified endocrine therapy (OFS) in combination with GnRH-analogues&#xD;
      since publication of the SOFT and TEXT trials.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will not be eligible for the registry for any of the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other genomic testing, besides MammaPrint®, has been performed on the tumor&#xD;
             material&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical or psychological conditions that would not permit the patient to sign informed&#xD;
             consent&#xD;

          -  Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current participation in any interventional clinical trial which tests anticancer&#xD;
