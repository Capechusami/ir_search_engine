  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CMTX-101 is a bacterial biofilm disrupting monoclonal antibody being developed as an adjunct&#xD;
      therapy with standard of care antibiotics. The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of CMTX-101 in healthy volunteers followed by a similar assessment in&#xD;
      patients with suspected or confirmed community acquired bacterial pneumonia of moderate&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main questions the study aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are single ascending doses of a CMTX-101 intravenous (IV) infusion safe and tolerated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of single-ascending doses CMTX 101&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do single ascending doses of CMTX 101 induce development of anti-drug antibodies (ADA)&#xD;
           and neutralizing antibodies (Nabs)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory efficacy biomarkers will also be measured in the patient part of the study.&#xD;
      Participants will be administered a single IV infusion of CMTX-101 over a 60-minute period;&#xD;
      patients will receive the infusion after starting standard of care antibiotics.&#xD;
