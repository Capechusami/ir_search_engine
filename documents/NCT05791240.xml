    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare interpreter use rates before and after allowing&#xD;
      non-English speaking families to call an interpreter themselves. The main questions it aims&#xD;
      to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is it feasible for families to call an interpreter themselves? Will allowing families to call&#xD;
      an interpreter themselves increase the rate of professional interpreter utilization?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given an interpreting tablet and instructed to use the interpreter&#xD;
      application whenever they would like to talk to the medical team. There will be a short&#xD;
      survey on the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention for the patients and the&#xD;
      medical team. The study team will then look at interpreter use rates before and after the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 25 million people in the United States have limited English proficiency. Patients&#xD;
      with limited English proficiency face worse clinical outcomes than their English proficient&#xD;
      counterparts, like longer length of stays, increased adverse events, and decreased&#xD;
      understanding of their child's care. Language barriers may be particularly important in the&#xD;
      pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), where parents encounter challenging medical decisions&#xD;
      like choosing to pursue high-risk therapies or making end-of-life decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Professional interpretation has been shown to mitigate negative outcomes for this population.&#xD;
      For instance, one study showed decreased mortality in the pediatric intensive care unit&#xD;
      (PICU) for Latino patients after in-person interpreter availability was increased; however,&#xD;
      interpreters are still widely underutilized. One study in a PICU revealed that only 53% of&#xD;
      doctors and 41% of nurses used an interpreter &quot;often&quot; for their patients who needed it. To&#xD;
      improve clinical outcomes for this population, communication with patients with LEP needs to&#xD;
      be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health disparities as a result of limited English proficiency are unjust, and a just medical&#xD;
      system would allow patients with LEP to access the same quality of care as their&#xD;
      English-proficiency counterparts. One way to improve communication may be to provide families&#xD;
      with an opportunity to initiate interpreter use on their own. Although families have&#xD;
      expressed a desire for this, no previous studies have examined the effects of this strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team hypothesizes that implementing a novel family-initiated interpretation system&#xD;
      will lead to greater use of interpreters, compared to the current standard of care. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to test this hypothesis in the PICU. The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explore the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of a family-initiated interpreter&#xD;
      intervention among healthcare providers, and the acceptability of the intervention among&#xD;
      families with limited English proficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examine the impact of family-initiated interpretation intervention on professional&#xD;
      interpreter utilization by comparing pre and post-intervention professional interpreter&#xD;
      utilization rates in the PICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By allowing families to initiate contact with an interpreter, the study team believe that&#xD;
      interpreter utilization will increase, with the potential to decrease disparities in the&#xD;
      limited English proficiency population. This work will inform future work to improve care for&#xD;
      patients with limited English proficiency, and the investigators plan to investigate the&#xD;
      clinical impact of this interpreter modality in future projects.&#xD;
