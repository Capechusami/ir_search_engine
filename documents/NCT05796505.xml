  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to reduce morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 amongst people who&#xD;
      are detained in and work in correctional facilities. The overall objective is to identify&#xD;
      feasible and effective interventions to improve vaccine uptake in correctional facilities and&#xD;
      study the effectiveness of these interventions through rapid cycle, cluster randomized trials&#xD;
      in the Pennsylvania prison system.&#xD;

      Aim 1: To identify correctional system strategies to address COVID-19 and influenza vaccine&#xD;
      acceptance amongst incarcerated people and correctional staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To select feasible strategies for a statewide correctional system at the patient-,&#xD;
      provider-, practice- and prison-level to address COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake&#xD;
      through a community engaged research approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To compare the effectiveness of interventions to address COVID-19 and influenza&#xD;
      vaccine acceptance using a rapid cycle cluster randomized trial design in prison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is highly innovative in its application of rapid cycle, cluster randomized trials&#xD;
      in correctional systems to test the effectiveness of strategies identified using a community&#xD;
      based participatory research approach. The results will serve as an evidence base for&#xD;
      improving vaccine uptake that can be scaled nationally and adapted for other populations&#xD;
      affected by the criminal legal system.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Rapid cycle cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). Randomization will occur at different levels, depending on the intervention that is being tested. Interviews: 14 key informant interviews will be conducted within each state correctional system that is identified as high performing (high vaccination rates for staff and incarcerated individuals). For rapid RCT: Pennsylvania Department Of Corrections operates 23 prisons which incarcerate approximately 35000 men and 1800 women. Every incarcerated individual in a PA prison is a potential candidate for the rapid RCT.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Interventions will be selected by the ADVANCE Steering Committee and will be rapidly deployed without additional effort on the part of front-line staff at four distinct levels: patient, provider, practice and prison level. Interventions will be tested one at a time in an iterative process. A participatory, assets-based framework will be used to identify acceptable and feasible strategies to improve vaccine acceptance. Each round of testing will include 1 month of preparation by the steering committee,12-week intervention period, and 2 months for analysis and rapid dissemination.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All incarcerated people in the Pennsylvania DOC are included in the study population&#xD;
             for these low risk interventions. In this each individual intervention, inclusion&#xD;
             criteria will be based on where incarcerated people are housed and therefore what&#xD;
             intervention they will be exposed to.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria will likely include severe physical or mental illness as these&#xD;
             individuals are often incarcerated in special units which will not be included in the&#xD;
             study (i.e. medical units).&#xD;
