    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma is a highly heterogeneous disease. Treatment strategies for advanced&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma are limited. Phosphatidylinositol proteoglycan 3 (GPC3) is a heparan&#xD;
      sulfate glycoprotein (HSPG) on the surface of the cell membrane. It is highly expressed in&#xD;
      liver cancer tissues, but hardly expressed in normal liver tissues. It is an ideal target for&#xD;
      tumor treatment. Investigators aimed to test the safety and efficacy of GPC3 CAR-T cells in&#xD;
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
