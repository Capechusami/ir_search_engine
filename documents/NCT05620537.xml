    <textblock>
      This multicenter retrospectively observational cohort study was conducted on participants&#xD;
      with histologically confirmed gastric and colorectal cancer who underwent radical surgery in&#xD;
      11 medical centers in China from August 1, 2015, to June 31, 2018. Baseline clinicopathologic&#xD;
      data and nutritional status assessments including Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002)&#xD;
      score and Patient-generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) rating were collected.&#xD;
      Variables will be screened using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)&#xD;
      regression model and Cox regression analysis. Internal and external validations will be&#xD;
      performed via the receiver operating curve (ROC), the area under the curve (AUC), the&#xD;
      concordance index (C-index), calibration plots, decision curve analysis (DCA), and Five folds&#xD;
      cross-validation by 200 times.&#xD;

      1. Study design and patients This study is a multicenter retrospectively observational&#xD;
           cohort study, which collected and followed up the patients with gastric cancer and&#xD;
           colorectal cancer in 11 Chinese hospitals from August 1, 2015, to June 31, 2018. The&#xD;
           eight sites of these were recruited as a training cohort, and the other three sites were&#xD;
           recruited as an external validation cohort (Supplement Table 1). The inclusion criteria&#xD;
           for both cohorts were complied with: 1) 18-80 years old; 2) postoperative pathological&#xD;
           diagnosis of gastric or colorectal adenocarcinoma; 3) underwent radical surgery; 4) TNM&#xD;
           stage ranged from stage I to stage III. The exclusion criteria included: 1) NRS 2002 or&#xD;
           PG-SGA data was missing; 2) pathological diagnosis of gastric stump cancer, cancer in&#xD;
           situ, or pin-point cancer; 3) in-hospital death or death within 30 days after surgery;&#xD;
           4) preoperative neoadjuvant therapy; 5) preoperative endoscopic surgery; 6) the previous&#xD;
           history of other malignant tumors; 7) pregnancy. This study was approved by the Ethics&#xD;
           Committee of each hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data collection The following clinical data were collected in this study: demographic&#xD;
           characteristics (age, sex, height, weight, and BMI), age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity&#xD;
           Index (aCCI), NRS 2002 score, PG-SGA rating, pathological characteristics (tumor stage,&#xD;
           type, differentiation, tumor size, and tumor vol-ume), surgical characteristics&#xD;
           (operation type and intraoperative blood loss), hematological indicators&#xD;
           [carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen19-9 (CA19-9), albumin, pre-albumin,&#xD;
           blood glucose, triglycerides (TG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate&#xD;
           aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine,&#xD;
           hemoglobin, and white blood cell], and other clinical characteristics (postoperative&#xD;
           complication and postoperative infection). These candidate variables were derived from&#xD;
           previous studies and clinical experience. We obtained tumor staging from electronic&#xD;
           medical records and pathological reports using the American Joint Committee on Cancer&#xD;
           (AJCC) 8th edition. Tumor volume was derived from tumor length, width, and height using&#xD;
           the following formulas: V = 1/2 × a × b2 or V = π/6 × a × b × c.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nutritional status assessments All the centers routinely perform nutritional status&#xD;
           assessments on admission by the NRS 2002 and PG-SGA. We collected the NRS 2002 score and&#xD;
           PG-SGA rating from the electronic medical record system.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 NRS 2002 NRS 2002 was used to estimate nutritional risk, accounting for inadequate&#xD;
           nutritional status (low, moderate, or severe) and illness severity (low, moderate, or&#xD;
           severe), with a 70-year age adjustment. The NRS 2002 score ranges from 0 to 7. For the&#xD;
           NRS 2002, we employed three categories: no nutritional risk (&lt;3), nutritional risk&#xD;
           (3-4), and severe nutritional risk (≥5).&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 PG-SGA The PG-SGA, a nutritional status assessment tool based on the SGA, was&#xD;
           developed exclusively for cancer patients. This includes self-evaluation by patients as&#xD;
           well as evaluation by medical professionals. The seven components that make up the core&#xD;
           content are weight, food intake, symptoms, functional ability, illness and its&#xD;
           relationship to nutritional needs, metabolic demand (stress), and physical examination.&#xD;
           The first four components were assessed by patients, while the final three were assessed&#xD;
           by medical professionals. Physical examination was used to determine muscular&#xD;
           exhaustion, subcutaneous fat thickness, and edema. Decreased mass and tone in temporal&#xD;
           regions, deltoids, and quads indicated muscular exhaustion. The triceps and midaxillary&#xD;
           lines at the level of the lower ribs were studied for subcutaneous fat depletion. Edema&#xD;
           was checked on the ankles. Patients were categorized as well-nourished (A), moderately&#xD;
           malnourished (B), or severely malnourished (C) based on the foregoing assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Outcome The primary outcome of this study was OS, defined as the time from the&#xD;
           date of surgery to the end of follow-up or death. Follow-up information was mainly&#xD;
           collected through the follow-up database of gastric and colorectal cancer of each center&#xD;
           combined with telephone, outpatient, or inpatient follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical methods Measurement data will be expressed as means and standard deviations&#xD;
           (SD), while enumeration data will be expressed as frequencies and respective&#xD;
           percentages. Hematological indicators will be converted to categorical variables while&#xD;
           analyzed. Variables will be initially screened using the least absolute shrinkage and&#xD;
           selection operator (LASSO) regression. The variables with minimum λ will be further&#xD;
           screened using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis to identify&#xD;
           independent predictors. Then we will build a prediction model by multivariate Cox&#xD;
           regression model and plot the nomogram. For user convenience, we will also create a&#xD;
           dynamic nomogram webpage. Discrimination of the model will be assessed using the&#xD;
           receiver operating curve (ROC), the area under the curve (AUC), and the concordance&#xD;
           index (C-index). Calibration plots will be used to assess the calibration of the model.&#xD;
           Decision curve analysis (DCA) will be used to evaluate the clinical utility of the&#xD;
           model. The same assessments will be performed with an external validation cohort.&#xD;
           Internal validation of the model will be performed using Five folds cross-validation by&#xD;
           200 times. The cut-off values of the nomogram score which categorize patients into three&#xD;
           categories (low-risk, middle-risk, and high-risk) will be calculated by X-tile 3.6.1&#xD;
           version (https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/rimm/research/software/). Kaplan-Meier analysis&#xD;
           will be used to do survival analyses. R 4.2.0 version (http://www.r-project.org) will be&#xD;
           used for statistical analyses of this study. A two-tailed p &lt;0.05 will be considered&#xD;
           statistically significant.&#xD;
