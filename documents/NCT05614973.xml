  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, two-arm, single-center study to compare efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      percutaneous ultrasound-guided liver biopsy of conventional method (multiple liver punctures)&#xD;
      versus coaxial method followed by needle tract plugging.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients who are referred for the ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy of focal liver&#xD;
      lesion (larger than 1cm) to obtain three or more tissue cores are eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are as follows: 1) unable to approach a target lesion under&#xD;
      ultrasound-guidance; 2) severe coagulopathy; 3) unable to discontinue&#xD;
      anticoagulant/antiplatelet medications for the duration proposed by 2019 Society of&#xD;
      Interventional Radiology guidelines; 4) co-presence of amyloidosis, large amount of ascites,&#xD;
      or acute hepatobiliary infections. All enrolled patients will be randomized into either the&#xD;
      conventional group or coaxial/plugging group. The conventional group will undergo&#xD;
      percutaneous liver biopsy for multiple tissue cores through multiple punctures of the liver&#xD;
      capsule. The coaxial/plugging group will undergo percutaneous liver biopsy using a coaxial&#xD;
      needle (single puncture of the liver capsule), which will be plugged by gelatin particles&#xD;
      after obtaining multiple tissue cores. The biopsy will be performed on outpatient basis&#xD;
      regardless of the randomized group, and the patients will be discharged after two hours of&#xD;
      observation. The rate of biopsy-related complications including bleeding (minor and major)&#xD;
      and diagnostic yield will be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
