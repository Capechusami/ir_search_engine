  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to promote healthy weight loss among African American women, age&#xD;
      30 or older, who are pre-diabetic and/or have high blood pressure and who live, work, or&#xD;
      worship in select rural communities throughout Alabama and Mississippi. The goal of the study&#xD;
      is to help reduce the burden of obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure for these women&#xD;
      and to collect information on the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation,&#xD;
      maintenance, and cost effectiveness of our two evidence-base weight loss programs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study leverages two evidence-based interventions (EBIs) that have been&#xD;
      culturally-adapted for the target population and have previously achieved clinically-relevant&#xD;
      weight loss and other clinical outcomes (educational group weight loss intervention) along&#xD;
      with improvements in diet and physical activity (home gardening intervention). Combining&#xD;
      these EBIs addresses multiple domains (behavioral, personal environment, sociocultural) and&#xD;
      levels (individual, interpersonal, community) of influence on risk factors for obesity and&#xD;
      other cardiometabolic diseases prevalent in the Deep South. These interventions, delivered by&#xD;
      local lay staff and non-academic partners, have a high potential for sustainability; however,&#xD;
      there is a need to further evaluate the external validity and implementation-related barriers&#xD;
      and facilitators to maximize reach, adoption and implementation. The investigators will&#xD;
      employ a pragmatic, multilevel, cluster-randomized, type 1 hybrid&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation trial. A total of 264 Black women (age â‰¥ 30 years) with&#xD;
      overweight or obesity and pre-diabetic or hypertensive from 12 rural counties (6 Alabama, 6&#xD;
      Mississippi) will receive either the combined educational group weight loss intervention plus&#xD;
      a home gardening intervention or the educational group weight loss classes alone. The&#xD;
      specific aims are to compare interventions on: (1) primary outcomes related to implementation&#xD;
      effectiveness (reach, adoption, maintenance of health behaviors), (2) secondary outcomes on&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness, and (3) cost effectiveness. Findings will inform discussions with&#xD;
      coalition partners to achieve our long-term goal of widely disseminating and sustaining&#xD;
      multi-level interventions to reduce the multiple chronic disease burden and health&#xD;
      disparities in the Deep South.&#xD;
