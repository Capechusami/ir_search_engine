  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of The PCOS Challenge Study will be to conduct high-quality research&#xD;
      where patients are included in the design, and answering the questions that patients identify&#xD;
      as important to their lived experience with PCOS. In partnership with clinical investigators,&#xD;
      patients will work on the development and management of data collection, the research agenda,&#xD;
      and the sharing of research findings. The PCOSC Study will promote the advancement of&#xD;
      research that provides reliable, useful, and meaningful information to patients with PCOS and&#xD;
      their clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population for The PCOS Challenge Study will include individuals with a clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of PCOS, individuals self-diagnosed with PCOS, individuals with symptoms of PCOS&#xD;
      (e.g., hirsutism, irregular menstrual cycles), and demographic-matched controls without PCOS.&#xD;
