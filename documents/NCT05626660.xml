      Our aim is to compare between right and left radial approach in patients undergoing&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary procedures regarding feasibility and complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The radial artery has progressively became the standard access site for percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      procedures both diagnostic and interventional. The first trans-radial access (TRA) for&#xD;
      cardiovascular diagnostics dates to 1947.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1989, the first case series of 100 coronary angiographies performed through the radial&#xD;
      access, demonstrating the safety and the fast mobilization of patients with the radial&#xD;
      approach .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main advantages of the radial approach are increased safety and comfort of the patients&#xD;
      with reduction of bleeding complications and immediate post-procedure ambulation .with these&#xD;
      advantages, current guidelines highly recommend radial access for coronary angiography and&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most clinical trials focused solely on the right radial approach (RRA) and rarely consider&#xD;
      the left radial approach (LRA). Indeed, the RRA has technical obstacles related to anatomy&#xD;
      and clinical practice like increased incidence of tortuosity of the subclavian artery and&#xD;
      radial-ulnar artery loop with the RRA Most operators use the right radial access as the left&#xD;
      radial access increase operator discomfort during vascular access and procedure, especially&#xD;
      in obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the left radial access has potential benefits for both the patient and operator. One&#xD;
      of which is that the left radial approach is associated with lower fluoroscopy time compared&#xD;
      with the right radial approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left radial artery as well is an appropriate alternative access for coronary catheterization&#xD;
      with less anatomical variations like tortuosity than the right radial artery Moreover, left&#xD;
      radial access is preferred for right handed patients because of temporary post-procedural&#xD;
      disability caused by haemostasis process in right radial artery access Also subclavian artery&#xD;
      tortuosity is significantly more common on the right side and is an important cause of&#xD;
      difficult, prolonged, or failed radial procedure, Kawashima et al examined 437 patients&#xD;
      undergoing diagnostic angiography through the left and right radial approaches. Severe&#xD;
      subclavian tortuosity is found in approximately 10% of the right radial access versus none in&#xD;
      left radial.&#xD;
