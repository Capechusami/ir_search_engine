    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, Phase 1 study, with 1 arm in Part 1 and a randomized parallel design in&#xD;
      Part 2. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the comparability of pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of two different amlitelimab drug products (DPs) after administration&#xD;
      of a single subcutaneus (SC) dose in healthy adult participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study details include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration for a participant will be approximately 17 weeks. The study includes a&#xD;
      screening period of up to 28 days, a 4-day institutionalization period, and a follow up&#xD;
      period for approximately 89 days (9 visits).&#xD;
