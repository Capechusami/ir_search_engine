  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized control trial is to compare outpatient transcervical foley&#xD;
      balloon to inpatient vaginal misoprostol in pregnant women for cervical ripening. The main&#xD;
      questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does outpatient transcervical foley balloon decreased the time from admission to&#xD;
           delivery compared to inpatient vaginal misoprostol&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does outpatient transcervical foley balloon will increase risk of c-section during&#xD;
           induction of labor compared to inpatient vaginal misoprostol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to either the outpatient transcervical foley balloon group or&#xD;
      to the inpatient intravaginal misoprostol group. The researchers will compare if outpatient&#xD;
      transcervical foley balloon decreases the tie from hospital admission to delivery of the&#xD;
      baby.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized unblinded control trial. Consented patients will have a&#xD;
      cervical exam performed in the clinic to confirm that the bishop score is less than 6. Once&#xD;
      this and the inclusion criteria are met, the participant will be randomized to either the&#xD;
      outpatient transcervical foley arm or the vaginal misoprostol arm. Each pregnant woman will&#xD;
      undergo the intervention stated in the numbered envelope which will be distributed based on&#xD;
      their order of inclusion in the study. Due to the nature of the procedure, blinding could not&#xD;
      be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the transcervical foley group will be scheduled an appointment in&#xD;
      the clinic the day before their scheduled induction day for the final screen and foley&#xD;
      placement. On the other hand, participants randomized to the vaginal misoprostol group will&#xD;
      be admitted to the labor and delivery unit on the day of their scheduled induction. All&#xD;
      participants will undergo a cervical examination before the assigned intervention to verify&#xD;
      their eligibility status. Those who do not meet the eligibility criteria, will be excluded.&#xD;
      Both transcervical foley and vaginal misoprostol are standard of care for induction of labor&#xD;
      at Hurley Medical Center. Thus, there would be no additional cost to the patient. The only&#xD;
      difference in the study is the setting in which the transcervical foley is placed, i.e. in&#xD;
      the obstetrics clinic as an outpatient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxytocin will be initiated in all patients who did not have at least three regular&#xD;
      contractions in 10 minutes. Continuous fetal heart rate monitoring and uterine activity&#xD;
      monitoring will be performed in all patients. Amniotomy will be performed during the course&#xD;
      of labor at the discretion of the health care provider and epidural anesthesia will be&#xD;
      administered per the patient's request.&#xD;
