  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VBI-2901e is an investigational vaccine candidate that uses enveloped virus-like particles&#xD;
      (eVLPs) to express the spike proteins of three coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that&#xD;
      causes COVID-19 disease), SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. The trivalent vaccine candidate is&#xD;
      designed to induce neutralizing antibody and cell-mediated immune responses against the spike&#xD;
      protein of the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, variants and subvariants of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 (such as Beta, Delta and Omicron BA.5) and other related coronaviruses that could&#xD;
      emerge in the future. VBI-2901e contains two adjuvants: aluminum phosphate and E6020. The&#xD;
      role of the adjuvants is to create a stronger immune response to the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 1 study will be an open-label study of VBI-2901e comparing three dose levels of&#xD;
      the E6020 adjuvant component (1, 3, or 10 µg per dose) in adults 18 to 40 years of age who&#xD;
      had previously received two or more vaccinations with licensed COVID-19 vaccine(s). VBI-2901e&#xD;
      at each dose level of E6020 will be administered as either a single dose or two-dose regimen.&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to test the safety of VBI-2901e and to learn more about its&#xD;
      ability to boost immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and the two related coronaviruses&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      VBI-2901e is an investigational trivalent COVID-19 vaccine candidate that comprises enveloped&#xD;
      virus-like particles (eVLPs) expressing the spike proteins of the betacoronaviruses&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV and the adjuvants aluminum phosphate and E6020 (a&#xD;
      toll-like receptor 4 agonist). The study will enroll participants 18 to 40 years of age who&#xD;
      have previously received two or more vaccinations with licensed COVID-19 vaccine(s) and will&#xD;
      test one or two intramuscular doses of VBI-2901e containing 5 μg of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,&#xD;
      165 µg of aluminum phosphate and 1, 3 or 10 µg of E6020. VBI-2901e is designed to induce&#xD;
      neutralizing antibody and cell-mediated immune responses against multiple coronavirus&#xD;
      respiratory disease strains and variants/subvariants of SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, open-label adjuvant dose-escalation study. The study will enroll&#xD;
      healthy adults, aged 18 to 40 years of age, who had previously received two or more&#xD;
      vaccinations with licensed COVID-19 vaccine(s), with the final dose administered a minimum of&#xD;
      6 months (24 weeks) prior to enrollment; have a negative PCR or rapid antigen SARS-CoV-2 test&#xD;
      at screening; and have met all other eligibility criteria. Participants with a history of&#xD;
      mild COVID-19 illness are eligible if they fully recovered a minimum of 6 months (24 weeks)&#xD;
      prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 participants will be enrolled in the study. Study groups will be enrolled&#xD;
      sequentially in an E6020 dose-escalating fashion starting with 20 participants to receive&#xD;
      VBI-2901e with 1 µg of E6020 (Group G1), followed by 20 participants to receive VBI-2901e&#xD;
      with 3 µg of E6020 (Group G2) and 20 participants to receive VBI-2901e with 10 µg E6020&#xD;
      (Group G3). Within each study group, participants will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive one or two doses of VBI-2901e.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group G1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subgroup G1-A: 10 participants to receive VBI-2901e at 5 µg with 1 µg E6020 per dose on&#xD;
           Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subgroup G1-B: 10 participants to receive VBI-2901e at 5 µg with 1 µg E6020 per dose on&#xD;
           Day 1 and Day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group G2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subgroup G2-A: 10 participants to receive VBI-2901e at 5 µg with 3 µg E6020 per dose on&#xD;
           Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subgroup G2-B: 10 participants to receive VBI-2901e at 5 µg with 3 µg E6020 per dose on&#xD;
           Day 1 and Day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group G3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subgroup G3-A: 10 participants to receive VBI-2901e at 5 µg with 10 µg E6020 per dose on&#xD;
           Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subgroup G3-B: 10 participants to receive VBI-2901e at 5 µg with 10 µg E6020 per dose on&#xD;
           Day 1 and Day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to select the optimal dose level of E6020 adjuvant (1, 3 or 10&#xD;
      μg) and number of doses (1 or 2 doses) of trivalent coronavirus vaccine candidate VBI-2901e&#xD;
      in individuals who had been vaccinated against COVID-19 previously. To achieve this&#xD;
      objective, the study will evaluate outcomes including safety and tolerability as well as&#xD;
      antibody and T cell immune responses against the original SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain,&#xD;
      selected SARS-CoV-2 variants, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.&#xD;
