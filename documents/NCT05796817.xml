  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In normal practice oxygen supply can be easily met with existing hospital infrastructure.&#xD;
      COVID - 19 however results in lung damage which greatly increases the amount of oxygen&#xD;
      patients require - as a consequence some hospitals in the UK and other countries had&#xD;
      situations where there was not enough oxygen for their inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID - 19 has caused many more patients to requiring assistance with their breathing using a&#xD;
      ventilator. Due to the limited supply of sophisticated ventilators that 're-use' oxygen&#xD;
      patients breathe out, some hospitals have used ventilators normally used by patients at home&#xD;
      (domiciliary ventilators). Whilst these are inexpensive and commonly available, any oxygen&#xD;
      the patient breathes out is simply released into the atmosphere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The address this problem, and in turn reduce the oxygen demand on hospital infrastructure the&#xD;
      biomedical engineering team (BME) at the Royal Brompton Hospital, London devised a simple 3-D&#xD;
      printed modification which captures and reuses oxygen on commonly used domiciliary&#xD;
      ventilators. Laboratory testing found this modification can increase the oxygen given by the&#xD;
      ventilator without increasing the oxygen consumption of the ventilator - effectively reducing&#xD;
      oxygen demand on hospital infrastructure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate this modification in patients admitted to intensive care requiring&#xD;
      assistance with their breathing. This will involve measuring oxygen levels on domiciliary&#xD;
      ventilators (Breas Nippy 4+, ResMed Lumis 150 or Vivo 1, 2 or 3) with and without the&#xD;
      modification and with small increases in oxygen supplied to the patient for a total study&#xD;
      period of 2 hours.&#xD;

    <description>The ventilator modification will be fitted to a ResMed Lumis 150, Breas® Nippy 4+ or Vivo 1, 2 or 3 ventilator. The participants oxygen level will be measured with and without the modification in place at their baseline ventilation, and with 1, 2 and 3 litres oxygen extra to their baseline. the researcher will then leave the modification on and slowly reduce the oxygen going into the ventilator, maintaining the participants SP02 at an acceptable level (&gt;95%)</description>
