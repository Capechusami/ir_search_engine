  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle strength can be defined as the ability of skeletal muscle to develop force for the&#xD;
      purpose of providing stability and mobility within the musculoskeletal system, so that&#xD;
      functional movement can take place.&#xD;

      Cerebral palsy describes a group of disorders of the development of movement and posture,&#xD;
      causing activity limitation, that are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that&#xD;
      occurred in the developing fatal or infant brain. The motor disorders of cerebral palsy are&#xD;
      often accompanied by disturbances of sensation, cognition, communication, perception, and/or&#xD;
      behaviour, and/or by a seizure disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development and changes in motor function, both natural and with therapy, can be assessed&#xD;
      using the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) created for children with CP&#xD;

    <description>A total of 97 children with CP between the ages of six and 12 years participated in the study. Muscle strength was measured with a handheld dynamometer. Motor function in children with CP was classified with the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), graded with the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM)</description>

        Muscle weakness was found in children with CP, increasing with severity of gross motor&#xD;
        function, approximately 50% of the predicted muscle strength was needed to be able to walk&#xD;
        without aids.&#xD;
