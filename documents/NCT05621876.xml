    <description>We will be testing patients who have already been diagnossed iwth primary immunodeficiency (PID) disease. there are 400 types of PID. We will test their blood before they receive antibody transfusion to evaluate the accuracy of our new screening test. We are trying to develop easy to use, low-cost screening tests for doctors to use with patients to detect those with low IgG levels before they are given the oral polio vaccine. These patients must be prioritized for intramuscular injections of a polio vaccine to prevent potential spread of wild type polio.</description>

      We will be retaining small amounts of plasma to be held at IPT in Tunisia for future testing.&#xD;
      We are asking study participants if they want to contribute samples to the biorepository. No&#xD;
      samples will be obtained without their consent. These samples will be de-identified, and only&#xD;
      be labelled with the type of PID the child experiences. There are 400 different types of&#xD;
      primary immunodeficiencies and we are trying to improve low-cost diagnostics to detect all&#xD;
      types to detect low IgG individuals to prevent the spread of polio from the polio vaccine.&#xD;

        PID patients prior to receiving IV-Ig treatment infusions for the first time or during&#xD;
        follow-up at the NBMT center in Tunis. The day of their monthly infusion, they are expected&#xD;
        to have the lowest residual IgG level. These patients have previously been identified with&#xD;
        AG, HAG, CVID and HIGM and this is why they are receiving IV-Ig therapy at NBMT. Patients&#xD;
        will be 6 months of age or older and the patient or guardian must give consent for&#xD;
        participation.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Knowledge gained from this study may benefit society by providing information on the diagnostic accuracy of the first PID RDT. Data obtained from this study will be made available to the test manufacturer to support their product dossier, and ultimately to provide countries still working to eradicate polio with quality-assured PID RDTs with analytical and clinical performance beyond that provided by the Jeffrey Modell warning signs.</ipd_description>
