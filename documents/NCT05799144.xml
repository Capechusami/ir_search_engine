  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial tests how well pB1-11 and human papillomavirus tumor antigen (TA-HPV)&#xD;
      vaccines in combination with pembrolizumab work in treating patients with oropharyngeal&#xD;
      cancer that has come back (recurrent) or that has spread from where it first started (primary&#xD;
      site) to other places in the body (metastatic) and that is PD-L1 and human papillomavirus&#xD;
      (HPV) positive. Oropharyngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer involving structures&#xD;
      in the back of the throat (the oropharynx), such as the non-bony back roof of the mouth (soft&#xD;
      palate), sides and back wall of the throat, tonsils, and back third of the tongue. Scientists&#xD;
      have found that some strains or types of a virus called HPV can cause oropharyngeal cancer.&#xD;
      pBI-11 is a circular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (plasmid) vaccine that promotes antibody,&#xD;
      cytotoxic T cell, and protective immune responses. TA-HPV is an investigational recombinant&#xD;
      vaccina virus derived from a strain of the vaccina virus which was widely used for smallpox&#xD;
      vaccination. Vaccination with this TA-HPV vaccine may stimulate the immune system to mount a&#xD;
      cytotoxic T cell response against tumor cells positive for HPV, resulting in decreased tumor&#xD;
      growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's&#xD;
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow&#xD;
      and spread by inhibiting the PD-1 receptor. These investigational vaccines could cause or&#xD;
      enhance an immune response in the body against HPV, during which time the activity of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab against oropharyngeal cancer associated with HPV may be strengthened. These&#xD;
      drugs in combination may be more effective in increasing the ability of the immune system to&#xD;
      fight oropharyngeal cancer than pembrolizumab alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and feasibility of intramuscular PVX7 (pBI-11/pBI-11/human&#xD;
      papillomavirus tumor antigen vaccine [TA-HPV]) immunization in patients with HPV+&#xD;
      recurrent/metastatic (R/M) oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) undergoing treatment with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the response rate (RR) of the addition of pBI-11 and TA-HPV to pembrolizumab (P)&#xD;
      as first line therapy for patients with PD-L1+ (combined positive score [CPS] &gt;= 1), HPV+,&#xD;
      R/M OPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and safety of the&#xD;
      combination of PVX7 and pembrolizumab in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate correlates of clinical activity by: (1) comparing HPV16/18 E6/E7-specific&#xD;
      cellular and humoral immunity in pre- versus (vs.) post-pBI-11 and TA HPV-treated OPC&#xD;
      patients that are pembrolizumab responders (R) and/or non-responders (NR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pBI-11 vaccine intramuscularly (IM), TA-HPV vaccine IM, and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) on study. Patients undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) and blood sample collection during screening and on study. Patients may undergo&#xD;
      tumor biopsy during screening and on study.&#xD;
