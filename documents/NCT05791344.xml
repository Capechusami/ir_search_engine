    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate electrocardiogram (ECG) changes in 100 patients&#xD;
      undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to assess new-onset conduction&#xD;
      abnormalities, such as atrioventricular nodal block (AVB) (1st, 2nd, or 3rd degree), or&#xD;
      new-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) that may occur during the procedure. Eligible&#xD;
      patients enrolled in this study will be monitored with an FDA-approved ECG Holter system&#xD;
      during TAVR, to assess intra-procedural changes. This will be a small-scale, early&#xD;
      feasibility study performed to inform a future, larger-scale prospective investigation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a well-established alternative to&#xD;
      surgical intervention for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) (1-4). The&#xD;
      rates of most TAVR complications have declined over time due to the improvement of operator&#xD;
      experience and technological advancement; however, conduction abnormalities continue to&#xD;
      persist (5). New-onset left bundle branch block (LBBB) and atrioventricular nodal block (AVB)&#xD;
      are among the most common conduction disturbances (6). Additionally, there is an increased&#xD;
      incidence of delayed (after discharge) HAVB (2nd-degree AVB Mobitz type 2 or 3rd-degree AVB)&#xD;
      in patients with preexisting (pre-TAVR) right bundle branch block (RBBB) and new-onset LBBB&#xD;
      post-TAVR, 13.2%, and 8.5%, respectively (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, conduction disturbances post-TAVR are assessed via post-procedural ECG, and&#xD;
      physicians performing TAVR are not provided feedback in real time. The use of intraprocedural&#xD;
      ECG could provide insight into the status of the heart's conduction system during TAVR and&#xD;
      prevent irreversible injury, requiring post-procedural monitoring at intensive cardiac care&#xD;
      unit (usually with a temporary pacemaker in situ) or even permanent pacemaker implantation.&#xD;
      Furthermore, given the increased incidence of HAVB after valve replacement in patients with&#xD;
      preexisting RBBB and new-onset LBBB, continued post-procedural ECG monitoring in this&#xD;
      particular subset of patients may provide more information on the progression of conduction&#xD;
      disturbances after TAVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a small-scale, early feasibility study evaluating intra-procedural ECG changes,&#xD;
      such as AVB (1st, 2nd, or 3rd degree), or new-onset LBBB, in patients undergoing TAVR, to&#xD;
      inform a future, larger scale, prospective investigation.&#xD;
