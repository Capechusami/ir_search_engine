      Development and Usability Testing of the ATOMIC Mobile App to Increase Physical Activity (PA)&#xD;

      The purpose of this program of research is to (1) determine the adaptations required of a&#xD;
      pre-existing mobile fitness app to tailor it for childhood cancer survivors using a&#xD;
      behavioral theory driven approach (Social Cognitive Theory) and (2) develop and evaluate the&#xD;
      usability of the adapted mobile app using the Technology Assessment Model. The Technology&#xD;
      Assessment Model (TAM), which theorizes the individuals' intentions to use information&#xD;
      technology, is based on two driving factors: perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use.&#xD;
      Future studies will evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of this app.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>There are 3 phases of this study:&#xD;
Participants will be shown features from the ATOMIC app and asked to discuss what features they like and what additional content, features and functionalities they would want for a specific PA app focused on pediatric cancer survivors. This information will be used to adapt the app.&#xD;
Use a &quot;talking aloud&quot; approach as they encounter issues with completing a series of tasks related to using the app. The design team and the research team will develop a new iteration of the platform that will then be vetted by our app creation committee and the next interview participants.&#xD;
&quot;Real Life&quot; Usability Testing. 6 pediatric cancer survivors. Individualized aerobic and resistance exercise intervention. The social-cognitive-theory-based mobile app will support the exercise intervention. One-on-one messaging chats with a PA coach through the mobile app will facilitate exercise goal establishment and attainment.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ease of use and user errors will be documented for each individual during usability testing, by completing several tasks while navigating the mobile app platform</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The interviewers will record how well the participants are able to navigate the task by recording either &quot;easy to find&quot;, &quot;with prompting&quot;, or &quot;unable to complete&quot;, representing completing the task completely on their own, with help from the interviewer, or unable to complete after prompting from the interviewer. The frequency of user errors will be calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Acceptability E-Scale is six-item tool that has been validated for assessing the usability, acceptability, and satisfaction of web based programs with statements ranked on a five point scale from very difficult to very easy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of a program has been proposed to be represented by obtaining a score of 24 or more.81 Good internal consistency (alpha = 0.76) as well as good initial validity has been reported. The acceptability E-scale will be administered at the completion of the &quot;in laboratory&quot; testing and &quot;real-life&quot; usability testing.</description>

    <description>B) &quot;Real Life&quot; Usability Testing. We will conduct a &quot;real life&quot; usability test in a sample of 6 pediatric cancer survivors. EX@HOME: Patients will perform an individualized aerobic and resistance exercise intervention, choosing from a list of PA, progressing from light to moderate-to-vigorous intensity totaling 30-45 min/d, 4-5 weekly/wk. for 4 weeks. The social-cognitive-theory-based mobile app will support the exercise intervention. One-on-one messaging chats with a PA coach through the mobile app will facilitate exercise goal establishment and attainment.</description>
