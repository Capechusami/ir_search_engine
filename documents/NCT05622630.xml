  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sensorimotor diabetic polyneuropathy is a common and serious complication of longstanding&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus. The therapeutic options are limited (pain therapy, antidepressants,&#xD;
      physical measures using direct current such as two- / four-cell baths). In the present study,&#xD;
      for the first time, after positive data from a pilot study, it is to be checked whether the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an existing therapy can be extended by treatment with heated granulate&#xD;
      stones in the rehabilitation setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The central aspect of this study is the proof of the effectiveness of the therapeutic&#xD;
      treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy with heated granulate stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent information from the study doctor and the patient's written consent will remove&#xD;
      the sociodemographic relationships from the standards of the Paracelsus Harz Clinic Bad&#xD;
      Suderode. Behavioral behavior and sporting behavior among those affected, as well as the&#xD;
      course of the disease, are treated using a questionnaire. Furthermore, medical parameters&#xD;
      (echocardiographic parameters, penalties, weight, BMI, waist-hip ratio, blood glucose, HbA1c,&#xD;
      total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, etc.) are determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomization list was created for randomization, with the randomization algorithm&#xD;
      assigning patient IDs to the two treatment groups. Randomization takes place using previously&#xD;
      sealed, opaque and consecutively numbered envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization at time T0 (before the first treatment) and T1 (after the last&#xD;
      treatment), the patients receive a questionnaire (see appendix) in which they should state&#xD;
      the symptoms, how long they have existed and the assessment of the intensity. The assessment&#xD;
      of the intensity is based on a spectrum from 1 = minor complaints to 6 = severe complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is measured using the SF-12 questionnaire, and anxiety and depression using&#xD;
      the HADS questionnaire are also measured at time points T0 and T1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term ECGs are performed to determine the heart rate variability at the beginning and at&#xD;
      the end of the rehabilitation measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A vibration sensation test with the tuning fork (8/8 scale) according to Rydel-Seiffer on the&#xD;
      metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe, the inner ankle and the tibial tuberosity is also&#xD;
      carried out at time T0 and T1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study group, the patients receive a foot bath treatment with heated stones of&#xD;
      different sizes three times a week for a period of 20 minutes. In the control group, therapy&#xD;
      with direct current (four-cell bath) is carried out. The study population consists of&#xD;
      patients from the Paracelsus Harz Clinic Bad Suderode who are undergoing rehabilitation due&#xD;
      to cardiovascular diseases and / or diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to start at time T0 with n = 34 rehabilitation patients in the basement and in&#xD;
      the KG. Even with a pessimistically estimated drop-out rate of 20% in the course of the study&#xD;
      at time T1 (after completion of the rehabilitation measure), n = 28 test persons per group&#xD;
      should still be available. This means that there are enough cases for stratifying analyzes.&#xD;
      With this case number planning, the criteria of a case number planning carried out are met.&#xD;
      Based on a planned power of the investigation of 80% (Î± = 0.05) with a drop-out of 20%, this&#xD;
      calculation resulted in a sample size of at least n = 28 subjects per group.&#xD;
