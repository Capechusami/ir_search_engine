  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium (POD) remains one of most common complication in elderly patients&#xD;
      receiving surgery, which is characterized by acute and fluctuating change in the level of&#xD;
      cognition and consciousness. Previous studies have shown that surgery and anesthesia-induced&#xD;
      acute peripheral inflammation and neuroinflammation may lead to delirium after surgery.&#xD;
      Systemic Inflammation Response Index (SIRI) is a more easily accessible and comprehensive&#xD;
      inflammation marker derived from monocyte, neutrophil, and lymphocyte count, which has been&#xD;
      investigated to assess the prognosis of cancer and infectious diseases. However, the&#xD;
      relationship between SIRI and POD has yet to be investigated.&#xD;

        Eligible patients were scheduled to undergo elective orthopedics surgery under spinal&#xD;
        anesthesia with an expected hospital stay of at least 3 days and received postoperative&#xD;
        patient- controlled analgesia. Delirium was evaluated at the preoperative visit, then twice&#xD;
        daily for 3 days following surgery. Cognition assessment was conducted at preoperative&#xD;
        visit, 24 h after surgery and 72 h after surgery. Delirium assessments were performed&#xD;
        before 10 AM and after 5 PM in the ward. The confusion assessment method (CAM)&#xD;
        questionnaire and cognition assessment method for MMSE were performed by the qualified&#xD;
        doctor who trained with CAM and MMSE training manual.&#xD;
