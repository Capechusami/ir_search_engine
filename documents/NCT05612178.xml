      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can suppress HIV to undetectable levels in people, but the virus&#xD;
      rebounds quickly if the drug treatment is stopped; this is because HIV can remain dormant in&#xD;
      a pool of blood cells called the persistent viral reservoir (PVR). Yet lifelong ART is&#xD;
      expensive and can lead to serious side effects over the long term. Some drugs may be more&#xD;
      effective at reducing the PVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if 2 study drugs (3BNC117-LS and 10-1074-LS) are safe and if they can lower the number&#xD;
      of HIV-infected blood cells in people with HIV who are on ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People aged 18 to 70 years with HIV who are on ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened. They will have a physical exam and blood and urine tests. They&#xD;
      will undergo leukapheresis. Leukapheresis is a procedure where blood is drawn from a needle&#xD;
      in one arm. The blood will pass through a machine that separates out the white blood cells.&#xD;
      The remaining blood will be given back through a second needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drugs or placebo (normal saline) will be administered 3 times at 20-week intervals.&#xD;
      The drugs will be given through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein in the arm.&#xD;
      This will take 1 hour. Some participants will receive only a saline solution. They will not&#xD;
      know if they are getting the drugs or the placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo leukapheresis up to 4 more times during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits every 10 weeks until the study ends.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is randomized placebo-controlled study of the safety and virologic activity of the&#xD;
      3BNC117-LS plus 10-1074-LS broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) combination during standard&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled sequentially and randomized to receive 3BNC117-LS plus&#xD;
      10-1074-LS or placebo (sterile saline) at a 1:1 ratio. Participants will receive three&#xD;
      intravenous infusions of 3BNC117-LS (dosed at 30 mg/kg) and 10-1074-LS (dosed at 10 mg/kg) or&#xD;
      placebo at weeks 0, 20 and 40. Participants will remain on ART during the study.&#xD;
