  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a self-administered rehabilitation tool that incrementally&#xD;
      guides the user to increase head motion to mitigate motion sickness and enhance postural&#xD;
      recovery following centrifugation or unilateral vestibular nerve deafferentation surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rehabilitation device guides users to perform sinusoidal head rotations, matched to a&#xD;
      metronome, about the yaw, pitch, and roll axes (60 sec epochs, 5 minutes per axis, 15 min&#xD;
      total). The assessment for each axis consists of the number of completed epochs with each&#xD;
      epoch requiring head rotations of a different amplitude. Subjects are instructed to begin&#xD;
      with an 'easy' amplitude (i.e. small) and increase or decrease amplitude depending on the&#xD;
      subject's perception of motion sickness - which is input from 0 (absent motion sick) to 11&#xD;
      (vomit) using a handheld controller. Video-oculography captures eye and head velocity as well&#xD;
      as tracks the number of blinks and saccades, metrics that can indicate worsening nausea.&#xD;
