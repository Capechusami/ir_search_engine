  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past 10 years, the rates of multiple sclerosis (MS) have nearly doubled in the&#xD;
      United States. This chronic, neuroinflammatory, and neurodegenerative disease is most often&#xD;
      diagnosed between the ages of 20-40. Cognitive impairment effects up to 70% of people with MS&#xD;
      (PwMS) and has a detrimental impact on mental health, social connections, and employment.&#xD;
      Further, up to 50% of PwMS also struggle with depression. Numerous cognitive rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs are available to address cognitive impairment, but few interventions have&#xD;
      simultaneous effects on cognition and emotional well-being. Music interventions have&#xD;
      potential to fill this gap. Brain imaging studies on music and emotion show that music can&#xD;
      modulate activity in the brains structures that are known to be crucially involved in&#xD;
      emotion. Further, music engages areas of the brain that are involved with paying attention,&#xD;
      making predictions, and updating events in our memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of an online musical training&#xD;
      intervention (MTI) for PwMS and explore the potential effect on cognition, psychosocial, and&#xD;
      functional well-being compared to an active control group (music listening (ML)). The&#xD;
      specific aims are to: 1) determine the feasibility and acceptability of delivering the MTI&#xD;
      virtually over three months to PwMS; 2) evaluate the effect of the MTI on cognitive&#xD;
      functioning (processing speed, working memory, cognitive flexibility, response inhibition),&#xD;
      psychosocial (anxiety, depression, stress, quality of life, self-efficacy) and functional&#xD;
      (insomnia) well-being compared to ML; and 3) (exploratory aim) to utilize non-invasive&#xD;
      neuroimaging to determine if pre-intervention brain activity predicts post-intervention&#xD;
      cognitive functioning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects more than 2.8 million people worldwide. The prevalence has&#xD;
      increased in every region worldwide since 2013, and in the United States, rates have nearly&#xD;
      doubled. It is the main cause of nontraumatic disability in young adults in many countries.&#xD;
      MS is a chronic neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease with an unpredictable course.&#xD;
      Varying visible and invisible symptoms occur in MS. The invisible symptoms, such as fatigue,&#xD;
      depression, psychological distress, insomnia, and cognitive dysfunction pose a significant&#xD;
      burden on quality of life (QoL) and workforce participation, rendering PwMS more vulnerable&#xD;
      to mental health challenges compared to those affected by physical disability alone.&#xD;
      Cognitive impairment occurs in 40-70%, depression in up to 50%, and fatigue can be present in&#xD;
      up to 85-95% of PwMS. The interplay of cognitive impairment, mood, impaired sleep quality,&#xD;
      and fatigue contributes significantly to worsened QoL. Cognitive impairment can occur in&#xD;
      early and late phases of the disease and may include alterations in information processing,&#xD;
      attention, executive functions and working memory. Multiple interventions have been created&#xD;
      to address cognitive impairments such as conventional cognitive rehabilitation,&#xD;
      computer-based programs, non-invasive brain stimulation, and neurologic music therapy. Many&#xD;
      of these interventions have shown improvements in various domains of cognitive impairment.&#xD;
      However, the effect of cognitive rehabilitation on psychosocial well-being in addition to&#xD;
      cognitive symptoms is rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research aims to fill a gap in cognitive rehabilitation with an innovative music&#xD;
      training intervention for PwMS. Active music engagement interventions (i.e., instrument&#xD;
      playing) have shown improvements in cognitive, motor, and psychosocial outcomes in other&#xD;
      neurological conditions. However, few studies have examined the impact for PwMS. Most music&#xD;
      intervention studies in PwMS evaluate the impact of music on fatigue, pain, mood disorders,&#xD;
      walking, and balance. The impact of music on cognition is much less studied. Our team is&#xD;
      currently conducting a systematic review examining the differences between active and passive&#xD;
      music engagement in PwMS. Sixteen studies were included in the review. Only two studies&#xD;
      examined active music making (singing or musical instrument playing), only one of those&#xD;
      evaluated the impact on cognition (no improvement), and neither evaluated the effect on&#xD;
      psychosocial (anxiety, depression, quality of life) outcomes. Twelve of the studies evaluated&#xD;
      passive music engagement (music listening with or without movement); however, the primary&#xD;
      outcome in most of these studies was neurological motor skills versus non-motor or&#xD;
      psychosocial outcomes. One study, that used both active and passive musical engagement,&#xD;
      examined the effect of cognitive rehabilitation plus neurological music therapy on cognitive&#xD;
      abilities, mood, emotional components, and MS quality of life. They found significant&#xD;
      improvements in cognitive function, motivation, emotional awareness, depression, and quality&#xD;
      of life in the intervention that entailed cognitive rehabilitation plus neurological music&#xD;
      therapy. However, no significant differences were found between the experimental group&#xD;
      (cognitive rehabilitation plus neurological music therapy) and active control (cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation alone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music listening and making is processed throughout spinal, subcortical, and cortical regions,&#xD;
      and thus has meaningful and broad impacts on complex cognitive, affective, and sensorimotor&#xD;
      processes. The impact of instrumental music playing on executive functioning has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in many studies with children; however, this has not been studied in PwMS.&#xD;
      Specific to executive function, neuroimaging studies with functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (fMRI) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) show an increase in neural&#xD;
      activations the right frontal and prefrontal regions in PwMS on cognitive tests requiring&#xD;
      lower cognitive load (e.g., 1-back) working memory tasks when compared to healthy controls&#xD;
      and lower activation on higher cognitive load tasks (2- and 3-back). Theoretically, it is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the neuronal damage caused by MS causes processing resources to be&#xD;
      diminished, thus different brain areas are recruited to cope with task demands as difficulty&#xD;
      increases. The rehabilitative effects of music in relation to other neurological disorders is&#xD;
      linked to changes in brain neuroplasticity, which describes the adaption and cortical&#xD;
      reorganization after training or learning a new task. This study will examine the feasibility&#xD;
      of an online musical training intervention (MTI) for PwMS, explore the potential effect on&#xD;
      cognitive functioning, psychosocial, and functional well-being, and explore a neuroimaging&#xD;
      via fNIRS, a non-invasive technique, to determine if pre-intervention brain activity predicts&#xD;
      post-intervention cognitive functioning.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomized to this arm receive a 12-week intervention to teach them how to play the ukulele. The ukulele is a very manageable instrument to learn and requires less hand dexterity than other stringed instruments. Each week participants will follow the musical training intervention (MTI) protocol that provides instruction on how to tune, hold, and strum the ukulele and play basic chords. To practice the chords, they will also learn popular songs (e.g., Chain of Fools, Three Little Birds, Happy Birthday, Don't Worry Be Happy, and Stand by Me). Participants will be instructed to follow each session outlined weekly and asked to practice the instrument for at least 30 minutes, 5 days a week. They will be given a paper and digital version of the MTI protocol. A member of our research team will call the participants weekly to answer any questions about the MTI protocol.</description>
