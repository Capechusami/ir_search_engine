  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to test automated text messaging as an effective behavior&#xD;
      change intervention in physical therapy patients. The main purpose of this study was to trial&#xD;
      sleep hygiene education for improving physical therapy patients' sleep through the use of&#xD;
      daily automated text messaging. Researchers will compare two groups to see if the&#xD;
      intervention group which consisted of participants getting daily automated text messages for&#xD;
      sleep hygiene tips would be effective in improving sleep, health, pain, and function compared&#xD;
      to a group that is receiving traditional physical therapy alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited from the outpatient physical therapy clinic verbally by their&#xD;
      therapist and by an informational handout they receive from the therapist. The student&#xD;
      researcher (who also works at this clinic) will then contact the participant to set up a time&#xD;
      to complete the initial survey questions at the clinic in a private treatment room. During&#xD;
      the initial visit, participants will read through and sign informed consent explaining the&#xD;
      procedures and expectations of them during the study. The participants will then complete the&#xD;
      following questionnaires: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Sleep Hygiene Index, Medical&#xD;
      Outcome Survey-sleep 9, Perceived Stress Scale, Numeric Pain Rating Scale, and Patient&#xD;
      Specific Functional Scale. The participants will randomly be assigned to one of two groups.&#xD;
      The intervention group will receive daily automated text messages scheduled for 8:00 pm every&#xD;
      evening. The text messages will include a variety of sleep hygiene behavioral tips for the&#xD;
      participant to try. This will last for a total of four weeks. The control group will not&#xD;
      receive any intervention during this time frame. Following the four weeks, student&#xD;
      researchers will return to each participant's clinic to collect the same data that was&#xD;
      collected at the initial visit. Each participant will have a total of 2 sessions to complete&#xD;
      with each session taking approximately 15-30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
