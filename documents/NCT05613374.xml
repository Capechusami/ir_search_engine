  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falling is considered one of the major problems that may affect the elderly, which may lead&#xD;
      to bad consequences. Safe walking needs the older adult to anticipate and respond quickly to&#xD;
      external demands and sudden environmental changes.Many studies have shown that treadmill&#xD;
      training is effective in improving the elderly person's ability to walk and avoid falls. The&#xD;
      C-Mill treadmill is an innovative device that recently used for the training of impaired gait&#xD;
      and balance.Therefore, this study will aim to evaluate the efficacy of gait training with a&#xD;
      virtual reality treadmill on the risk of fall in the elderly.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fall injuries produce serious threats to elderly people. Fall hazards are many, they include&#xD;
      physical, psychological, social, and economic consequences. Many studies have shown that&#xD;
      walking and balance exercises effectively contribute to enhancing walking performance,&#xD;
      improving obstacle avoidance, and reducing the incidence of falls in the elderly. Therefore,&#xD;
      the practice of complex and challenging situations of the usual daily walking is very&#xD;
      important to prevent falls. Many studies have shown that treadmill training is effective in&#xD;
      improving the elderly person's ability to walk and avoid falls. The C-Mill treadmill is&#xD;
      recently used for the training of impaired gait and balance. C-Mill applies a virtual reality&#xD;
      environment, obstacle avoidance games, and a variety of balance challenges in a safe and&#xD;
      controlled environment to increase walking adaptability and improve performance in everyday&#xD;
      life.Fall injuries produce serious consequences. The management of these injuries is costly&#xD;
      and has a negative impact on healthcare entities. Therefore, prevention programs for&#xD;
      preventing and reducing falls among the elderly are very important for reducing these serious&#xD;
      consequences. Therefore, this study will compare the efficacy of gait training with a virtual&#xD;
      reality treadmill and the conventional physical therapy training program on the risk of fall&#xD;
      in the elderly.&#xD;

    <description>The Biodex Balance System was used to assess the Change in the Overall Stability Index of the Fall Risk Test. In this study, the dynamic level (11) will be selected for applying the fall risk test. The result for every child will be registered and compared to the normative data stored in the software of the device based on children age range.</description>

    <description>The Biodex Balance System will be used to assess the change in the Overall Stability Index and the Time of Control of the Limit of Stability Test. This test involves measurement of overall directional control which represented as a percentage value (%). The higher scores will indicate better balance control. The test also include measurement of total time required to complete the test (seconds), improvement in this parameter requires minimizing the time recorded to complete the test.</description>

    <description>The Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) will be used to assess the following parameters in older adults: fall risk, walking ability, balance, and mobility. It is a reliable, valid and sensitive test that is a specific measure of the probability for falls among elderly.</description>

    <description>Participants in the experimental group will receive a treatment program that is comprised of two parts.&#xD;
The first part included training, for (30 minutes), on The C-Mill virtual reality treadmill. The C-Mill is an instrumented treadmill with interactive virtual reality games and applications. The C-Mill applies an augmented virtual reality environment, obstacle avoidance games, and a variety of balance challenges in a safe and controlled environment to increase walking adaptability and performance in everyday life.&#xD;
