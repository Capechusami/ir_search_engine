  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of improved endotracheal intubation&#xD;
      procedure combined with early oral intake on postoperative recovery quality of patients, so&#xD;
      as to further optimize the ERAS（enhanced recovery after surgery） program for thyroid or&#xD;
      parathyroid surgery.&#xD;

      After being informed about the study and potential risk, all patients giving written informed&#xD;
      consent will undergo a screening-period to determine eligibility for study entry. On the day&#xD;
      of operation, patients will be randomly assigned to conventional intubation process group or&#xD;
      improved intubation process group before the operation. After the operation, patients will&#xD;
      enter the PACU（post-anaesthesia care unit） for further observation. When the&#xD;
      anesthesiologists and surgeons agree that patients have no water eating contraindication,&#xD;
      patients will be randomly assigned to early resumption of oral intake group or late&#xD;
      resumption of oral intake group for further observation and evaluation.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Randomized controlled trial：Participants who enroll in randomized controlled trials differ from one another in known and unknown ways that can influence study outcomes, and yet cannot be directly controlled. By randomly allocating participants among compared treatments, an randomized controlled trial enables statistical control over these influences. Provided it is designed well, conducted properly, and enrolls enough participants, an randomized controlled trial may achieve sufficient control over these confounding factors to deliver a useful comparison of the treatments studied.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Refers to the improved intubation process of recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring tube published by the applicant on Journal of Clinical Anesthesia, that is, first place the recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring tube under the guidance of visual laryngoscope, and then directly fix the recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring tube after confirming that the recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring signal is stable, and finally change the patient's body position to the neck hyperextension supine position.</description>

    <description>It means that the recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring tube is intubated according to the intubation method described in the current guidelines, that is, after the completion of tracheal intubation, the recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring tube is not fixed, the patient's body position is changed to the neck hyperextension supine position, and then the recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring tube is replaced with laryngoscope or adjusted under blind detection, until the recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring signal is satisfied, the recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring tube is fixed.</description>

    <description>Drink 30-50ml of normal temperature water after meeting the post-anaesthesia care unit transfer out standard. If the patient swallows successfully and does not cough, after returning to the ward, medical personnel of the ward will guide patient to resume drinking and eating early: patient will resume drinking water within one hour after returning to the ward, a small amount of water for several times until the amount of drinking water reaches 300ml. If the patient does not have discomfort symptoms, the patient will resume eating according to normal drinking and eating habits.</description>
