      This is a single-center, prospective, real-world observational study designed to enroll all&#xD;
      patients eligible for enrollment. Basic data, treatment methods, postoperative complications&#xD;
      and limb function were collected. The differences in postoperative complications,&#xD;
      postoperative limb function and so on between patients who underwent LARS ligament&#xD;
      implantation and bone prosthesis replacement (ligament group) and patients who underwent bone&#xD;
      prosthesis replacement (control group) were compared.&#xD;

      This is a single-center prospective real-world observational study of 100 eligible patients&#xD;
      with bone tumors who are scheduled to undergo LARS ligament implantation and/or bone&#xD;
      prosthesis replacement in Henan Cancer Hospital in the next 10 years. Basic data, treatment&#xD;
      methods, postoperative complications and limb function were collected. The differences in&#xD;
      postoperative complications, postoperative limb function and so on between patients who&#xD;
      underwent LARS ligament implantation and bone prosthesis replacement (ligament group) and&#xD;
      patients who underwent bone prosthesis replacement (control group) were compared.&#xD;
