    <textblock>
      This project seeks to study the impact of Good Behavior Game (GBG), a behavior management&#xD;
      program, on classroom environment and problem behavior in K-3 classrooms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this randomized trial is to study the impact of Good Behavior Game (GBG), a&#xD;
      behavior management program, on classroom environment and problem behavior in K-3 classrooms&#xD;
      in Sweden. The main question it aims to answer is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Does GBG decrease problem behaviors in K-3 classrooms?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teachers in the intervention group will be trained in GBG and asked to implement it in their&#xD;
      respective classrooms. Teachers in the comparison group will provide usual practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Early conduct problems are prevalent and a prominent risk factor for several&#xD;
      adverse health-related and psychosocial outcomes in later life. Good Behavior Game (GBG) is a&#xD;
      promising school-based behavior management program with the potential of reaching many&#xD;
      children in their formative years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To study the effectiveness of Good Behavior Game in reducing problem&#xD;
      behaviors in Swedish K-3 classrooms under real-world conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: To investigate changes in problem behaviors in common school areas,&#xD;
      classroom climate, teacher collective efficacy, on-task behavior, and behavioral management&#xD;
      practices as a result of teacher training in GBG. The study also seeks to investigate&#xD;
      implementation as a moderator, as well as potential barriers and facilitators in regards to&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of trial: Cluster-randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design and methods: Recruitment of schools in a Swedish municipality started early&#xD;
      2021. In May 2021, 5 schools were randomized to either intervention group or wait-list&#xD;
      (service-as-usual). Data collection started in August 2021 and ended in June 2022. The&#xD;
      intervention group received training in GBG from September 2021 to May 2022 by certified&#xD;
      trainers who also collected fidelity data through observations throughout the school year.&#xD;
      Teacher ratings and observer data was collected at baseline (August 2021), along with a first&#xD;
      (November 2021) and second follow-up (May 2022, primary endpoint) throughout the first school&#xD;
      year of implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methodology and analysis: Statistical analysis will primarily include frequentist&#xD;
      intent-to-treat analysis, and comparisons of estimates with a corresponding Bayesian model&#xD;
      using weakly informative priors.&#xD;

    <description>A teacher rates 14 items drawn from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). The instrument itself is called The Barrier Buster Tool. The instrument primarily measures contextual factors that are thought to affect implementation and fidelity of a method being implemented. Every item has two ratings. First rating scores if the statement is a barrier (0), neutral (1) or facilitating factor (2). The second column rates the strength of the factor, i.e., if the factor is considered to have a weak/no effect (0) or strong effect (1). Only measured in the experimental group receiving GBG.</description>

The trainers used standardized observation forms detailing several components of a GBG session, such as setting rules and announcing the time frame.

The average score is then calculated from all sessions.</description>

A score of 1 means the teacher has been certified at the end of the school year. The requirements for certification are: participating in all 3 workshops, conducting at least 60 sessions, being observed and receiving feedback at least 9 times with the trainers assessing the sessions as having high enough fidelity.</description>
