      This phase 2a study will involve enrolment of men presenting with progression of biopsy&#xD;
      proven prostate cancer who require imaging for staging/re-staging of their disease. The&#xD;
      participants enrolled will be further sub-stratified into two groups; one group of men with&#xD;
      hormone-sensitive disease (cohort A), and a second group of men with castrate-resistant&#xD;
      disease being considered for 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy (Cohort B).&#xD;

      This phase 2a study will involve enrolment of men presenting with progression of biopsy&#xD;
      proven prostate cancer who require imaging for staging/re-staging of their disease. The&#xD;
      participants enrolled will be further sub-stratified into two groups; one group of men with&#xD;
      hormone-sensitive disease (cohort A), and a second group of men with castrate-resistant&#xD;
      disease being considered for 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy (Cohort B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve men who are being staged or re-staged for metastatic prostate cancer&#xD;
      by their treating doctor. The treating doctor will refer the patient to the nuclear medicine&#xD;
      department at St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney for study enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and D0 visits will be combined for this study. Standard of care bloods&#xD;
      (haematology, biochemistry, eGFR and PSA) will be collected at screening/D0 if the results&#xD;
      are not already available from the treating doctor. Prior 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET scan within 3&#xD;
      months will be collected from the treating doctor. The PI will ensure that the bloods and&#xD;
      68Ga-PSMA-11 PET scan are reviewed to establish final eligibility before participant&#xD;
      undergoes 64Cu-SAR-BBN injection (200mbq) and imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening/Day 0 visit, the participant will undergo two imaging scans at 1 hour and 3&#xD;
      hours after having 64Cu-SAR-BBN administration. Total lesional assessment will be calculated&#xD;
      with MIM Encore 6.8.7 (MIM Software, Cleveland) using data from the above time points. Safety&#xD;
      assessment will be conducted once the participant is enrolled in the study at screening/Day 0&#xD;
      and 48 hours post 3 hours scan by phone call. All adverse events will be recorded on a case&#xD;
      report form as source documentation.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Copper-64 labelled SAR-Bombesin</intervention_name>
    <description>radiolabeled antagonist analog of bombesin for the diagnosis and treatment of gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)-positive tumors in adults. The product is Copper-64 labelled SAR-Bombesin (Cu-SAR-BBN). Cu-SAR-BBN uses radioactive forms (radionuclide) of copper, copper-64 (64Cu) to image cancers using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and then copper-67 (67Cu) for therapy by internal beta radiation. 64Cu-SAR-BBN has 3 basic components; the radionuclide (64Cu), bound via MeCOSar (a bifunctional metal chelator, SAR) to a bombesin analog that targets GRPR.</description>
