  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this investigation is to determine whether water carbonation can&#xD;
      improve orthostatic tolerance in healthy control volunteers. Orthostatic tolerance refers to&#xD;
      the ability to maintain an adequate blood pressure when standing. In some individuals blood&#xD;
      pressure can fall when standing, predisposing to dizzy spells or fainting episodes. Drinking&#xD;
      water can boost blood pressure and making fainting episodes less likely. However, it is not&#xD;
      clear whether the carbonation of the water has any further impact on the blood pressure&#xD;
      response. This is important because it may be that carbonated water expands the stomach&#xD;
      (gastric distension), provoking an increase in sympathetic activity. The increase in&#xD;
      sympathetic nervous system activity boosts blood pressure. Resolving this question would have&#xD;
      important implications for patients with syncope. This study will test whether carbonated&#xD;
      water will have any further impact on blood pressure than the already known effect of&#xD;
      non-carbonated water.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this investigation is to determine whether water carbonation can&#xD;
      improve orthostatic tolerance in healthy control volunteers. Orthostatic tolerance refers to&#xD;
      the ability to maintain an adequate blood pressure when standing [1]. In some individuals&#xD;
      blood pressure can fall when standing, predisposing to dizzy spells or fainting episodes [1].&#xD;
      Drinking water can boost blood pressure and making fainting episodes less likely [2-8].&#xD;
      However, it is not clear whether the carbonation of the water has any further impact on the&#xD;
      blood pressure response [9,10]. This is important because it may be that carbonated water&#xD;
      expands the stomach (gastric distension), provoking an increase in sympathetic activity. The&#xD;
      increase in sympathetic nervous system activity boosts blood pressure. Resolving this&#xD;
      question would have important implications for patients with syncope. This study will test&#xD;
      whether carbonated water will have any further impact on blood pressure than the already&#xD;
      known effect of non-carbonated water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers (n=25) will be asked to undergo a &quot;tilt test&quot; to assess cardiovascular reflex&#xD;
      control and orthostatic tolerance (measured as time to presyncope, or near fainting, in&#xD;
      minutes). It has been previously shown that this technique to be reproducible, reliable, and&#xD;
      to have high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating persons with differing&#xD;
      orthostatic tolerance, or for examining the effects of interventions aimed at improving&#xD;
      orthostatic tolerance [4,6,11-18].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will undergo this test on three separate days. On each day participants will be&#xD;
      asked to drink a glass of water: either a 50ml drink of room temperature water (control&#xD;
      condition), a 500ml drink of flat (non-carbonated) room temperature water, or a 500ml drink&#xD;
      of carbonated room temperature water. The study will be conducted in a randomised,&#xD;
      single-blind fashion. The investigator responsible for terminating the test will be blinded&#xD;
      as to the water condition on each test day, rendering the study single blind. It will not be&#xD;
      possible to blind participants as to the carbonation of the water, however, participants will&#xD;
      not be informed as to the hypothesised impact of the water conditions.&#xD;
