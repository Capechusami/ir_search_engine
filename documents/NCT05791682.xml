  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study was aimed to evaluate and compare clinical efficacy of the Microfilled resin sealant,&#xD;
      Nanofilled resin sealant, Flowable composite as sealant, with Unfilled resin sealant on first&#xD;
      permanent molar in children at 9 months follow ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children (age 7 to 10) with deep pits and fissures, (ICDAS 0-2) included in the study and&#xD;
      study was Split mouth randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size- Total number of 42 patients will be recruited in the study, with 42 first&#xD;
      permanent molars in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods-Patients were seated in supine position on the dental chair and cotton rolls will be&#xD;
      applied for isolation. The first permanent molar in each group was treated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 -Intervention with Microfilled resin sealant. Group 2- ¬Intervention with Nanofilled&#xD;
      resin sealant. Group 3 -Intervention with Flowable composite as sealant. Group 4 -&#xD;
      ¬Intervention with Unfilled resin sealant. Patients and their parents were received&#xD;
      instructions for daily brushing and oral hygiene maintenance. Sealant clinical efficacy was&#xD;
      evaluated at 3, 6 and 9 month recall visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary outcomes: To evaluate sealant retention, anticaries effect and marginal&#xD;
           integration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary outcomes: to evaluate, colour change and surface roughness of sealant.&#xD;

    <description>Alpha- The sealant is similar to polished enamel. Bravo- The sealant surface is similar to composite material surface contained submicron filler.&#xD;
Charlie- The surface is rough that prevents the explorer movement along the surface.</description>
