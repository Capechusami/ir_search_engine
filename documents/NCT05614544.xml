    <textblock>
      This single center study will consist of 2 parts. Part 1 will be an open-label, dose-finding&#xD;
      study of HSK3486 and propofol conducted in up to 48 recreational users of CNS depressants to&#xD;
      determine the appropriate doses to be used in Part 2 of the study. Part 2 will be a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled 4-period, 4 way crossover, in&#xD;
      approximately 42 healthy volunteers with prior recreational CNS depressant exposure. Both&#xD;
      Part 1 and Part 2 of the study will consist of an outpatient Screening Visit, an in-clinic&#xD;
      Treatment Phase, and Follow-up; Part 2 will also include a Qualification Phase.&#xD;
