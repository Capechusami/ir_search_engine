  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the potential effects of photobiomodulation&#xD;
      when used with topical disinfectants in the anterior nares of healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over a three week period, participants will have their anterior nares swabbed with methylene&#xD;
      blue, chlorhexidine gluconate, or a combination of the two followed by 4 minutes of&#xD;
      non-thermal red light treatment. The fourth week of consist of only red light treatment.&#xD;
      Culture samples of the subjects nasal microbiome will be taken prior to treatment,&#xD;
      immediately after treatment, 4-, 8-, 24-, and 48 hours after treatment.&#xD;

      This is an exploratory, single-center, open-label, single-arm study with microbiological&#xD;
      endpoint using photobiomodulation (PBM) and topical disinfectants to determine the effect on&#xD;
      the nasal microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The photobiomodulation system distributes about 700mW of light to each nostril using a&#xD;
      2-channel diode laser with non-thermal, red light. The topical disinfectants are methylene&#xD;
      blue (0.01%) and chlorhexidine gluconate (0.25%). Following a pretreatment nasal culture,&#xD;
      these two disinfectants will be administered into the patient's anterior nares followed by a&#xD;
      two-minute light cycle. This process is repeated once more resulting in two treatments cycles&#xD;
      (4-minutes total). Following this, nasal cultures are taken immediately and at 4-, 8-, 24-,&#xD;
      and 48- hours. Broad spectrum and Staphylococcus spp. culturing of nasal swabs will be&#xD;
      conducted. Swabs will also be submitted for Next Generation Sequencing to characterize the&#xD;
      effect of light and disinfectants on the nasal microbiome.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A single open-label healthy group is being evaluated for any changes to the normal nasal microbiome. Each week nasal cultures will be done and the subject exposed to different interventions including red light alone, and several disinfectants. Nasal cultures will be done for 48 hours after the intervention to determine the effect, if any, on the nasal microbiome.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>The change in bacterial bioburden during the week of each of the four weeks respective intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The Quantitative outcome measure is the change from baseline in nasal bacterial bioburden (measured in CFU/mL) by the effects of red light photobiomodulation on nasal bacteria when used with and without topical disinfectants. Each subject's baseline nasal bacterial level is determined prior to the weekly intervention. There are no subject reported outcome measures.</description>

    <measure>Effect of PBM with Topical Disinfectants (Semi-Quantitative)</measure>
    <time_frame>The change in bacterial bioburden during the week of each of the four weeks respective intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The Semi-quantitative outcome measure is the change in bacterial growth between different time points measured by the number of quadrants with bacterial growth on a culture plate. Photographs of each culture plate will allow visual comparisons between time points. Each subject's baseline nasal bacterial level is determined prior to the weekly intervention.</description>

    <measure>Effect of PBM with Topical Disinfectants (NGS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The change in bacterial bioburden during the week of each of the four weeks respective intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal culture responses over several days will be evaluated using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to determine how long it takes for the nasal microbiome to return to its previous non-treated level. NGS allows for determining what percentage of the total microbiome a certain species of bacteria is.</description>

Once the treatment has been completed, a new culture will be taken from the subjects nares followed by one at 4-, 8-, 24-, and 48-hours after treatment.</description>
