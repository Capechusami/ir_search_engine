             years (i.e., with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's&#xD;

             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator&#xD;

         17. Has a known psychiatric or substance abuse disorder that would interfere with the&#xD;
