      This feasibility study seeks to enhance long-term positive airway pressure (PAP) adherence&#xD;
      among Spanish-speaking Hispanics, a group with known PAP outcomes disparities. This study&#xD;
      will assess the feasibility, usability and 6-month effectiveness of a linguistically and&#xD;
      culturally adapted efficacious tele-management intervention (Automated Management, AM) for&#xD;
      Spanish-speaking Hispanic adults with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (N=50). A prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, parallel group, unblinded, feasibility trial is proposed. AM is a tele-management&#xD;
      strategy that includes evidence-based components for improving shorter-term PAP adherence&#xD;
      consisting of education, support and troubleshooting, and brief targeted motivational&#xD;
      enhancement delivered by tele-messaging. The automated two-way, interactive communication is&#xD;
      algorithmic based on PAP use and behavioral profiles defined at baseline. The innovative,&#xD;
      technology-based interventions are designed to ensure access to sustained care that overcomes&#xD;
      barriers such as distance/geography, transportation limitations or lost work/productivity&#xD;
      time. As such, AM can provide equitable access to quality long-term PAP management that may&#xD;
      mitigate known PAP adherence disparities for minority adults with OSA. If effective for&#xD;
      long-term PAP adherence, these strategies may alter OSA care paradigms, improve outcomes and&#xD;
      associated healthcare costs, and reduce disparities.&#xD;
