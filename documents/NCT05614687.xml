  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot experimental study is to test a community-informed art-based programme&#xD;
      in improving community members trauma from crime and to aid the reintegration of ex-offenders&#xD;
      into society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main question it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ What is the feasibility in terms of recruitment, retention, adherence to the intervention&#xD;
      and communities/victims' satisfaction with CiAbP to promote healing and improve the&#xD;
      successful reintegration of ex-offenders into society?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly allocated into two groups. The first group, the intervention&#xD;
      group, will receive the Community-informed Art-based programme (CiAbP). The second group will&#xD;
      receive government intervention involving media messages from the National Orientation Agency&#xD;
      devoid of CiAbP. The CiAbP. sessions will cover relevant aspects of art, such as photo story,&#xD;
      story telling, poetry, and drawing in tackling trauma and negative attitudes towards&#xD;
      ex-offenders reintegration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will compare CiAbP group with the media orientation group to see if there are&#xD;
      differences between a change in attitude towards ex-offenders' reintegration at base line,&#xD;
      end of intervention and three months follow up.&#xD;
