  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of anovulatory&#xD;
      infertility among young women. This syndrome is a reproductive and endocrinological disorder&#xD;
      that affects up to 18% of reproductive-aged women. To date, the only strategy shown to&#xD;
      reverse PCOS is sustained weight loss of 5-10%. At present, daily calorie restriction (CR) is&#xD;
      the main diet prescribed to patients with PCOS for weight loss. However, some women find it&#xD;
      difficult to adhere to CR because calorie intake must be vigilantly monitored every day.&#xD;
      Considering these problems with CR, another approach that limits timing of food intake,&#xD;
      instead of number of calories consumed, has been developed. This diet is called &quot;time&#xD;
      restricted eating&quot; (TRE) and involves confining the period of food intake to 6-8 h per day.&#xD;
      TRE allows individuals to self-select foods and eat ad libitum during a large part of the&#xD;
      day, which greatly increases compliance to these protocols. Recent findings show that TRE&#xD;
      significantly reduces body weight, insulin resistance, and inflammation in adults with&#xD;
      obesity. However, no randomized controlled trials have studied the role of TRE in treating&#xD;
      PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, this study will compare the effects of TRE vs CR in females with PCOS over 6&#xD;
      months on body weight, androgen markers, inflammatory markers and insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A 6-month randomized, controlled, parallel-arm trial will be implemented. Females&#xD;
      with obesity and PCOS will be randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1) 6-h TRE (ad libitum food&#xD;
      intake from 1-7 pm, fasting from 7pm-1pm); (2) CR (25% energy restriction daily); or (3)&#xD;
      control group (ad libitum intake with no meal timing restrictions).&#xD;
