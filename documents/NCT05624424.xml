  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergence agitation (EA) is a transient, self-limited, non-fluctuating state of psychomotor&#xD;
      excitement, which closely revolves around the emergence of general anesthesia. Uncontrolled&#xD;
      EA during the recovery period increases the potential risk of injury to patients and medical&#xD;
      staff, resulting in varying degrees of adverse consequences, such as elevated blood pressure,&#xD;
      incision rupture, bleeding, cardio-cerebrovascular accidents and so on, leading to a great&#xD;
      waste of resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accumulating scientific evidence indicates that the incidence of EA is related to the use of&#xD;
      perioperative sedative drugs. As a novel ultra-short-acting benzodiazepines drugs,&#xD;
      Remimazolam has been accepted for induction and maintenance of clinical anesthesia. Compared&#xD;
      to traditional benzodiazepines drugs, Remimazolam combines the safety of midazolam with the&#xD;
      effectiveness of propofol, and also has the advantages of acting quickly, short half-life, no&#xD;
      injection pain, slight respiratory depression, independent of liver and kidney metabolism,&#xD;
      long-term infusion without accumulation, and has a specific antagonist: flumazenil. This&#xD;
      study aims to investigate whether perioperative sedation of Remimazolam besylate, propofol,&#xD;
      and sevoflurane have different effects on the incidence of emergence agitation and&#xD;
      hemodynamics in patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery.&#xD;
