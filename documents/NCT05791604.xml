  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disease, with hyperappetite and severe obesity.&#xD;
      At present, there is no effective drugs and interventions to help control the appetite of PWS&#xD;
      patients. More and more evidence has shown that gut microbiota is closely related to obesity.&#xD;
      Probiotics and prebiotics can improve the structure of gut microbiota, thus improve blood&#xD;
      lipid levels and other biochemical indicators of obese people. Therefore, this study intends&#xD;
      to explore the effectiveness and safety of probiotics and prebiotics in controlling appetite&#xD;
      and weight gain of PWS children.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disease, with hyperappetite and severe obesity.&#xD;
      Morbid obesity and related complications caused by hyperappetite are the most common causes&#xD;
      of poor prognosis and death in PWS. At present, there is no effective drugs and interventions&#xD;
      to help control the appetite of PWS patients. At present, more and more evidence has shown&#xD;
      that gut microbiota is closely related to obesity. Probiotics and prebiotics can improve the&#xD;
      structure of gut microbiota, thus improve blood lipid levels and other biochemical indicators&#xD;
      of obese people. Therefore, this study intends to explore the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      probiotics and prebiotics in controlling appetite and weight gain of PWS children.&#xD;
      Participants will be divided into three groups, receiving probiotics, probiotics+probiotics&#xD;
      or placebo treatment, and observe the changes in body weight, the structure of gut microbiota&#xD;
      and metabolic level.&#xD;
