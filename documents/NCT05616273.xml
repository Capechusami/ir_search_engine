  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from destruction of insulin producing beta cells by the body's&#xD;
      own immune system (autoimmunity) causing an individual to lose the ability to make enough&#xD;
      insulin to control their blood sugar levels and need to have insulin injections to lower&#xD;
      blood glucose levels. Whilst high blood sugar level is a problem for people with Type 1&#xD;
      diabetes, taking insulin medication to lower sugar levels, delayed meals and exercise can all&#xD;
      result in dangerously low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia). The biological causes of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia, and ways to prevent it are poorly understood. In non-diabetic individuals, a&#xD;
      hormone called glucagon is secreted naturally to raise blood glucose levels but it is unclear&#xD;
      why glucagon secretion is impaired during hypoglycaemia in individuals with T1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective observational study is to test the relationship between a&#xD;
      glucagon stimulation test and risk of hypoglycaemia in T1D. It is hoped this research will&#xD;
      establish whether this relationship could be used as a blood test and be a clinically useful&#xD;
      biomarker of hypoglycaemia risk and, therefore, directly inform clinical care of people with&#xD;
      T1D, particularly those with highest risk of hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT) at Visit 1 or 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an Arginine Stimulation Test (AST) at Visit 1 or 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a Light MMTT or repeat AST at Visit 3 (approx 6-7 months of Visit 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and self-reported time spent in hypoglycaemia will&#xD;
           be undertaken for 2 weeks following Visits 1 and 3.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood glucose levels are normally controlled by insulin, a hormone that lowers high blood&#xD;
      glucose levels, and glucagon which is released into the blood to raise glucose when levels&#xD;
      are low. For people with Type 1 diabetes (T1D), taking insulin medication to lower glucose&#xD;
      levels can sometimes result in dangerously low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia). The&#xD;
      ability to release glucagon and correct blood glucose can vary, particularly in people who&#xD;
      have had T1D for years. The study aims to find out how blood glucagon levels after a stimulus&#xD;
      compare to a person's own experience of hypoglycaemia, and hypoglycaemia. This research will&#xD;
      establish whether glucagon measured after a meal could be used as a blood marker of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia risk and help to identify individuals at high risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Low post-mixed meal (MM) stimulated glucagon secretion predicts hypoglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to consent, all potential participants will be provided with detailed written&#xD;
      information about the study (that complies with the UK General Data Protection Regulation&#xD;
      (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018) and an opportunity to discuss it with one of the&#xD;
      research team. All participants will be informed of their right to withdraw from the study at&#xD;
      any time without prejudice or jeopardy to any future clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A unique study ID will be allocated to the participant to link all participant study&#xD;
      information and samples. The participant's clinical characteristics and sample results will&#xD;
      be recorded on the participant's Case Report Form and entered on the study database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo core data collection, measurements and provide fasted and&#xD;
      stimulated blood samples via a cannula at the baseline MMTT and AST visits 1 and 2 and again&#xD;
      at the 6 months 'Light MMTT' / repeat AST visit. The order of MMTT and AST tests in visits 1&#xD;
      and 2 will be randomised to check for an order effect. Test choice for Visit 3 depends on the&#xD;
      peak glucagon results from Visits 1 and 2. At Visits 1 and 3, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the hypoglycaemia questionnaire data (Clarke and Gold scores) to assess awareness of&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia and quality of life measures which may relate to the MM-glucagon. Participants&#xD;
      will be given an Abbot FreeStyle Libre Pro continuous blood glucose monitor (CGM) and asked&#xD;
      to perform a 2-week continuous measure of blood glucose (CGM). Clinical diabetes care will&#xD;
      not be changed and participants with T1D will use their own insulin regimes and&#xD;
      self-monitoring (even if CGM or Abbot FreeStyle Libre Pro) during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasted samples will be obtained for baseline measures: routine glucose and HbA1c, plasma and&#xD;
      serum for storage and future batched analysis including measures of glucose, glucagon,&#xD;
      insulin (C-peptide) and other markers of interest, plus sodium heparin and PAXgenesRNA&#xD;
      samples for T1D immune function analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulated samples (see test descriptions below): insulin (C-peptide), glucose and glucagon&#xD;
      will be measured at all time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each test period, the participant's blood glucose will be checked and&#xD;
      appropriate advice will be given relating to insulin dosage adjustments and a light meal will&#xD;
      be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT) at Visit 1 or 2 (approx 2Â½ hours) Rationale: The MMTT&#xD;
      will provide confirmatory analysis of post-mixed meal glucagon stored in BD P800 and EDTA&#xD;
      plasma samples at a range of standard MMTT time points (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min) in 75&#xD;
      people. Glucose will be measured in Fluoride Oxalate samples at the same time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  be monitored closely throughout their visit for any discomfort or problems and&#xD;
           appropriate advice/support will be given if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  be given Ensure HP or Fortisip (6ml/kg to a max of 360mls)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have blood samples collected, to measure insulin, C-peptide, glucose, and glucagon, at&#xD;
           specific intervals: -10, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes post meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Arginine Stimulation Test (AST) Visit 1 or 2 (approx 1 hour) Rationale. An MMTT (despite&#xD;
      being convenient because it avoids the need for an IV stimulus) has limitations, including&#xD;
      differences in gastric emptying, uptake and effects on enteroendocrine secretion. Therefore,&#xD;
      responses will be compared during the MMTT with those obtained during an intravenous arginine&#xD;
      challenge, Arginine Stimulation Test (AST), (5 g Arginine during 1 min) at a separate visit&#xD;
      from the MMTT visit. Glucose, plasma glucagon and C-peptide will be measured at baseline and&#xD;
      specific intervals following the Arginine bolus injection. This test is designed primarily to&#xD;
      test the maximum insulin secretion capacity of a participant's beta cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AST test involves:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Set up. Intravenous catheters will be inserted into antecubital veins in both arms. One&#xD;
           arm will be used for infusion of Arginine (amino acid), and the other arm for&#xD;
           intermittent sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline samples will be taken at -10 and 0 minutes. A maximally stimulating dose of&#xD;
           Arginine Hydrochloride (5 g) will be injected intravenously for 45s. Samples will be&#xD;
           collected at 2, 5, 10, 15 and 30 minute intervals following the Arginine bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) 'Light MMTT' - Visit 3, approx 6 months after Visit 1 (2 hours) This test is as described&#xD;
      above for MMTT but only a single sample will be collected at the most informative time, as&#xD;
      assessed from the first MMTT and AST. Clinical data will be collected, plus hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      questionnaires and 2-week CGM data collection with participant blinded Abbott FreeStyle Libre&#xD;
      Pro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 3, the choice of test will be either a 'Light MMTT' or a repeat AST, determined by&#xD;
      the peak glucagon results from the tests conducted at Visits 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Recording: Data will be initially recorded using a study-specific case&#xD;
      report form (CRF), with hard copies stored in the Trial Master File (TMF). Anonymised&#xD;
      research data will be recorded on a study-specific database and reviewed for discrepancies&#xD;
      and missing data prior to analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Definition: The end of the study is the 3 months after the final participant's 7&#xD;
      months follow-up period to allow for final collection of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for premature withdrawal from the study: Where a participant withdraws, data will be&#xD;
      collected up to the point of withdrawal in line with the protocol and study SOPs. Where a&#xD;
      participant has prematurely withdrawn but not revoked consent, data and samples will remain&#xD;
      within the study and included in any analysis. Where consent is withdrawn, study samples and&#xD;
      data will be kept/destroyed as per local guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples: A detailed SOP/work instruction will detail the clinical procedure for sample&#xD;
      collection, labelling, logging and management. Central laboratory analysis of the study&#xD;
      samples will be undertaken at the Exeter Blood Sciences Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stored samples: Surplus samples for storage should be processed, logged and frozen at -80Â°C&#xD;
      within 24 hours of receipt. All saved samples will be stored under the study ID, with the&#xD;
      file linking the study code to personal identifiable information held securely by the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator, accessible only to personnel with training in data protection who&#xD;
      require this information to perform their duties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety, Definitions and Reporting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks: The blood samples will be collected by members of the research team trained in&#xD;
      venepuncture. During the MMTT/AST test, there is a possible risk of hyperglycaemia and&#xD;
      appropriate advice/support will be given if required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits: The study may improve understanding of participants' hypoglycaemia risk. In the&#xD;
      longer term, this work may provide evidence that the ability of alpha cells to release&#xD;
      glucagon after a mixed meal is variable within people with T1D, associated with hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      risk, and could be a biomarker for hypoglycaemia risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions and reporting of adverse effects (what should be reported?) The timeframe for&#xD;
      recording SAEs will be from the time of consent to one week following the last visit of a&#xD;
      study subject. Any reportable adverse effects noted will be reported within 24 hours to the&#xD;
      CI and the Sponsor as per standard NHS R&amp;D protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insurance: Sponsor's public liability will be provided by the University of Exeter for the&#xD;
      design and management of the study. NHS indemnity will apply for the conduct of the study at&#xD;
      the site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Handling &amp; Record Keeping: The CI is responsible for ensuring that participant anonymity&#xD;
      is protected and maintained, ensuring that their identities are protected from any&#xD;
      unauthorised parties. The CI is the 'Custodian' of the data. All information related to study&#xD;
      participants will be kept confidential and managed in accordance with the UK GDPR and Data&#xD;
      Protection Act 2018, NHS Caldicott Guardian, UK Policy Framework for Health &amp; Social Care,&#xD;
      and Research Ethics Committee Approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A unique Study ID will be allocated to each participant. All study data and samples will be&#xD;
      pseudo-anonymised and stored under the Study ID on a secure password-protected study&#xD;
      database. Identifiable information will be stored on a separate, secure password-protected&#xD;
      database held on an NHS server to enable the research team to undertake the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All paper copies of study data will be stored under ID number and kept in locked,&#xD;
      access-controlled offices within the research facilities; research data will be held&#xD;
      separately to identifiable information. Researchers involved in data analysis will not have&#xD;
      access to personal identifiable data, only the anonymised research data. No identifiable data&#xD;
      will be included in research publications or progress reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any participant information required to be sent to a third party will adhere to these&#xD;
      pseudo-anonymised parameters. No participant identifiable data will be sent outside the EU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Record Retention and Archiving: When the research study is complete, it is a requirement of&#xD;
      the UK Policy Framework for Health &amp; Social Care and Sponsor Trust Policy that the records&#xD;
      are kept for a further 15 years. At the end of the study, anonymised data will be included in&#xD;
      the study's final dataset and stored indefinitely on vivli.org or similar sponsor/funder&#xD;
      approved data repository. Personal data will be stored where consent is given by the&#xD;
      participant to be contacted for follow-up on their future health status, and/or about&#xD;
      participating in future studies. Where consent is given by the participant, their samples and&#xD;
      data from the project will be gifted to the Peninsula Research Bank (an approved tissue bank,&#xD;
      REC ref 19/SW/1059) to be used for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, it will be archived by the CI at the University of Exeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: For a sample size of 75, it should be possible to detect a correlation&#xD;
      between stimulated glucagon and hypoglycaemia of r=0.3, with 95% confidence intervals 0.08 to&#xD;
      0.49, plus correlation of MM-induced increases in plasma glucagon to plasma co-peptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance: The CI will ensure that the study is conducted in compliance with the principles&#xD;
      of the Declaration of Helsinki (2013), the principles of GCP and in accordance with all&#xD;
      applicable regulatory requirements including but not limited to the UK Policy Framework for&#xD;
      Health &amp; Social Care and the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trial) Regulations 2004, as&#xD;
      amended in 2006, 2008 and 2009 and any future relevant or replacement EU Regulations, Trust&#xD;
      and R&amp;D Office policies and procedures and any subsequent amendments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication Policy: Results will be written up and submitted for publication in a&#xD;
      peer-reviewed journal(s). Abstracts will be submitted to national and international&#xD;
      conferences. Results will be presented to clinical colleagues at regular in-house meetings. A&#xD;
      letter/newsletter outlining the key findings of the study will be sent to all participants&#xD;
      and will be uploaded to the study website. An in-person/online event may also be arranged.&#xD;

        75 individuals with long duration T1D, identified from participation in the TIGI study (UK&#xD;
        IRAS ID: 141756, REC Number: 13/SW/0312), with consent to be contacted for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The TIGI participants have a clinical diagnosis of T1D, were on insulin from diagnosis and,&#xD;
        if BMI was &gt;30, were autoantibody positive. We will aim to recruit 50 people with&#xD;
        undetectable C-peptide and 25 with detectable C-peptide. The selection of people with&#xD;
        absent C-peptide allows a secondary analysis focussed on stimulated glucagon without any&#xD;
        potential interaction with endogenous insulin secretion. It also focusses on a group of&#xD;
        people known to be at high hypoglycaemia risk due to lack of endogenous insulin.&#xD;
