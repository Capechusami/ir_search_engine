  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized study will be conducted in Bolu Abant İzzet Baysal University&#xD;
      Hospital. Chronic low back and hip pain 72 patients aged between 18-70 years will be included&#xD;
      in the study. The primary output of our study was NRS scores. The study of Manchikanti. L et&#xD;
      al. (control group NRS reduction 4.4 ± 1.8; α margin of error 0.05, power 99%) (3) was taken&#xD;
      as the basis for determining the sample size. Using the G Power 3 calculator program, 72&#xD;
      patients were identified to reduce their NRS scores by 25%. With a 20% exclusion rate, the&#xD;
      total number of patients was calculated as 90&#xD;

      Demographic information of all patients included in the study; name, surname, telephone&#xD;
      number, age, gender, educational status, profession, and marital status will be recorded. The&#xD;
      duration of the pain, the onset of the pain, the accompanying leg pain, the activities that&#xD;
      increase or decrease the pain, the presence of neurological symptoms, the analgesic agents&#xD;
      used in the last week, and the previous treatments will be noted. Lumbar MRI findings and the&#xD;
      level of pathology causing low back and hip pain will be recorded. History, family history,&#xD;
      comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, cardiac disease,&#xD;
      hypothyroidism), and detailed physical examinations of the patients will be recorded.&#xD;
      Examinations of the patients before and 3, 6, and 12 weeks after the injection will be&#xD;
      performed, and NRS scores at 3 and 6 weeks. The procedures will be repeated for patients who&#xD;
      are over 4 years old. During the pre-procedural evaluation, the patients will be informed&#xD;
      about the study, information about the Numeric Rating Score (NRS), Oswestry Disability Index&#xD;
      (ODI), Short Form-36 (SF-36) to be used for post-procedure analgesia, and both verbal and&#xD;
      written consents will be obtained. The staff who will make the evaluation will not know which&#xD;
      group the patients belong to, and the study will be blinded.&#xD;

    <description>It will be advanced towards the sacral hiatus and local anesthesia of the skin and subcutaneous tissue will be provided with 2% lidocaine. The caudal epidural space will be entered by puncturing the sacrococcygeal ligament with the tip of a 22 G black needle from the appropriate area and taking a pop sensation. It will be confirmed that there is no bleeding or cerebrospinal fluid in this area by applying saline in real-time sonography and after the caudal epidural spread is observed, aspiration is performed. Afterward, a 10 mL volume of bupivacaine 4cc/20mg+ triamcinolone 2cc/80mg+0.09% NaCl 4cc mixture will be administered into the caudal epidural space</description>
