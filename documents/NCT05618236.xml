      In this study, it was aimed to compare the use of sugammadex instead of neostigmine +&#xD;
      atropine in the reversal of NMB in children undergoing lower abdominal surgery or urogenital&#xD;
      surgery, and to compare the rates of postoperative agitation, nausea and vomiting using the&#xD;
      FLACC scale, PAED scale and ICC parameters.After the approval of the local ethics committee&#xD;
      and written consent from the family, patients who underwent ASA 1, 5-12 years old lower&#xD;
      abdomen surgery or urogenital surgery in Pendik Training and Research Hospital will be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in the study will be those who were maintained with routine 2-3%&#xD;
      sevoflurane inhalation anesthetic and 0.2mcg/kg/min remifentanil intravenous anesthetic, and&#xD;
      decurarized with 0.5-1 mg/kg rocuronium. No drugs other than those administered by the&#xD;
      responsible Anesthesiologist during the operation will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in the study will be divided into 2 groups according to the agent used&#xD;
      in decurarization. There is no condition for the number of patients in the group to be equal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower abdominal surgery and urogenital surgery are frequently performed surgeries in the&#xD;
      pediatric patient population aged 5-12 years. Therefore, pain, agitation, nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      occurring in the early postoperative period and afterwards are important problems for&#xD;
      pediatric patients. The incidence of agitation, which is a postoperative behavioral disorder&#xD;
      due to the use of sevoflurane and desflurane, varies between 2 and 80%, depending on the&#xD;
      scoring system and anesthesia technique. It is more common in preschool children (3-5 years).&#xD;
      Agitation despite spontaneous resolution; It is still considered a potentially serious&#xD;
      complication due to the risks of self-harm and the stress it causes in the family. It can&#xD;
      also cause pain and bleeding, prolonging the recovery period (1). Therefore, it is a problem&#xD;
      that should be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neostigmine is the most commonly used agent for reversing neuromuscular blockade (NMB) (2).&#xD;
      Cholinesterase inhibitor agents used in decurarization have serious side effects, especially&#xD;
      because they stimulate the muscarinic system as well as nicotinic receptors (3). These are&#xD;
      hypersalivation, bradycardia, bronchoconstriction, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal cramps&#xD;
      (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sugammadex is a cyclodextrin group drug, which is an aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking&#xD;
      agent, has a selective effect on rocuronium and vecuronium and mechanically binds these&#xD;
      molecules, providing rapid excretion and decurarization. Recurarization and muscarinic side&#xD;
      effects are not expected in this type of decurarization(5). When acetylcholine esterase&#xD;
      inhibitors are used to reverse neuromuscular block, they can cause postoperative residual&#xD;
      curarization (PORC)(6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common complication in the pediatric&#xD;
      population. The incidence in children varies between 33.2% and 82% depending on the risk&#xD;
      factors of the patient. This rate is twice that of adults. PONV typically describes nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, or retching. It may start in the recovery unit and continue for 24 hours. PONV&#xD;
      causes dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, longer stay in the recovery unit, A&lt; it causes&#xD;
      delays and ultimately a significant financial burden(7). Therefore, it is a complication that&#xD;
      should be avoided as much as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is the most important risk factor in the development of agitation. In order to reduce&#xD;
      all these complications, we hypothesized that sugammadex was superior to neostigmine +&#xD;
      atropine in reducing side effects compared to decurarization.In this study, it was aimed to&#xD;
      compare the use of sugammadex instead of neostigmine + atropine in the reversal of NMB in&#xD;
      children undergoing lower abdominal surgery or urogenital surgery, and to compare the rates&#xD;
      of postoperative agitation, nausea and vomiting using the FLACC scale, PAED scale and ICC&#xD;
      parameters.After the approval of the local ethics committee and written consent from the&#xD;
      family, patients who underwent ASA 1, 5-12 years old lower abdomen surgery or urogenital&#xD;
      surgery in Pendik Training and Research Hospital will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in the study will be those who were maintained with routine 2-3%&#xD;
      sevoflurane inhalation anesthetic and 0.2mcg/kg/min remifentanil intravenous anesthetic, and&#xD;
      decurarized with 0.5-1 mg/kg rocuronium. No drugs other than those administered by the&#xD;
      responsible Anesthesiologist during the operation will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in the study will be divided into 2 groups according to the agent used&#xD;
      in decurarization. There is no condition for the number of patients in the group to be equal.&#xD;
      Group N; neostigmine+atropine, GROUP S; This will be the group of patients decurarized with&#xD;
      sugammadex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0-45 days after patients are extubated. And at the 2nd hour, FLACC Scale (Pain Diagnostic&#xD;
      Scale), PAED (Pediatric Anesthesia Recovery Delirium) Scale assessment methods will be&#xD;
      compared in terms of pain and agitation. Nausea and vomiting will be noted as SPSS 22.0&#xD;
      program will be used in statistical analysis. Mean, standard deviation, median lowest,&#xD;
      highest, frequency and ratio values will be used in the descriptive statistics of the data.&#xD;
      The distribution of variables will be measured with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Independent&#xD;
      sample t-test and mann-whitney u-test will be used in the analysis of quantitative&#xD;
      independent data. Paired sample t-test will be used in the analysis of dependent quantitative&#xD;
      data. The MC Nemar test will be used in the analysis of dependent qualitative data. Repeated&#xD;
      Measure Anova will be used in the analysis of repeated measurements. The fischer test will be&#xD;
      used when the conditions for the -square test and chi-square test in the analysis of&#xD;
      qualitative independent data are not met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis was performed using the G*Power (v3.1.7) program to determine the number of&#xD;
      samples. The power of the study is expressed as 1-β (β = probability of Type II error) and in&#xD;
      general studies should have 80% power. According to Cohen's effect size coefficients;&#xD;
      According to the calculation made by assuming that the evaluations to be made between two&#xD;
      independent groups will have a medium effect size (d=0.50), there must be at least 65 people&#xD;
      in the groups to achieve 80% power at the α=0.05 level.&#xD;
