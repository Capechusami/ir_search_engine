  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed study is to compare the efficacy of behavioral treatment (BT) to&#xD;
      memantine, a psychopharmacological agent, for BFRBs. 28 subjects with trichotillomania (TTM)&#xD;
      or skin picking disorder (SPD) will receive 8 weeks of memantine treatment, followed by 8&#xD;
      weeks of comprehensive behavioral therapy (ComB) treatment. The hypothesis to be tested is&#xD;
      that behavioral therapy will be associated with superior clinical outcomes as compared to&#xD;
      memantine. A second hypothesis is that both memantine and behavioral therapy will demonstrate&#xD;
      improvement from baseline to the respective posttreatment assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hair pulling disorder (i.e., trichotillomania, TTM) and skin picking disorder (SPD) are often&#xD;
      categorized under the umbrella term of BFRB disorders. These repetitive, intentionally&#xD;
      performed behaviors often cause noticeable cosmetic issues and may result in clinically&#xD;
      significant distress or functional impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral therapy (BT) is generally regarded as the first-line treatment for BFRBs. One type&#xD;
      of BT is comprehensive behavioral treatment (ComB), a treatment that emphasizes habit&#xD;
      reversal training and various techniques that target specific BFRB triggers (e.g., sensory&#xD;
      cues, such as pressure on the scalp; environmental cues, such as bright lights and mirrors),&#xD;
      including emotion dysregulation. The ComB protocol was methodically developed based on expert&#xD;
      consensus and demonstrated promising results in one single case design study and a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial comparing it to a minimal attention control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has also found benefit of pharmacological agents in the treatment of BFRBs. Most&#xD;
      recently, a randomized controlled trial of memantine vs. placebo found statistically&#xD;
      significant improvements in disorder severity and life functioning in the memantine group as&#xD;
      compared to the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are emerging behavioral and psychopharmacological interventions for BFRBs, the&#xD;
      research is limited. Additionally, there are no studies comparing the efficacy of first-line&#xD;
      behavioral treatments to promising medication interventions for this class of disorders.&#xD;
      Given the serious personal consequences associated with trichotillomania and skin picking&#xD;
      disorder, there is substantial need for additional research to clarify the best available&#xD;
      treatments for BFRBs. Doing so would facilitate future research and the development of&#xD;
      refined treatment guidelines. Therefore, the current trial aims to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      behavioral therapy and memantine in adults with trichotillomania and skin picking disorder.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>National Institutes of Mental Health Symptom Severity Scale (for trichotillomania or Skin Picking) (NIMH-TSS or NIMH-SPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The primary efficacy endpoints will be the change in these measures from baseline to week 8 in memantine treatment vs. ComB treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy measure will be the change in hair pulling or skin picking frequency and urges to pull hair or pick skin for the past week as indicated by change in total score on the NIMH Symptom Severity Scale (for Trichotillomania or Skin Picking). The primary endpoints will be used to examine differential improvements for memantine vs. BT. Total scores on the NIMH-TSS and NIMH-SPS range from 0-20, with higher scores representing greater severity of trichotillomania/skin picking.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions -- Improvement Scale (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A clinician-rated measure to assess global improvement in symptoms. The scale ranges from 1 (Very much improved) to 7 (Very much worse). The results will be dichotomized as improved (CGI-I score of 1 or 2) or not improved (CGI-I score of 3-7). The scale will be assessed at the end of the memantine treatment, at the end of the washout period, and at the end of the ComB therapy treatment.</description>

    <description>Brief, self-report instrument for assessing repetitive hairpulling. Seven individual items, rated for severity from 0 to 4, assess urges to pull, actual pulling, perceived control, and associated distress. Total scores range from 0-28, with higher scores indicating greater severity of trichotillomania (TTM).The scale will be administered at screening, the end of the memantine treatment, at the end of the washout period, and at the end of the ComB therapy treatment.</description>
