    <textblock>
      The study is prospective, open-label, randomized, single-center study involving patients&#xD;
      admitted on an emergency basis with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) clinic who underwent PCI&#xD;
      of an infarct-related artery (IRA) and had intermediate coronary artery lesions (50-70%&#xD;
      stenosis diameter) and elevated LDL-C ( &gt; 1.4 mmol/l) despite statin therapy at the highest&#xD;
      dosage. Patients who showed high compliance and did not reach the target LDL-C values 1 month&#xD;
      after the development of ACS on the 2nd visit will be randomized into two groups of 60&#xD;
      patients each. Group 1 - taking PCSK9 inhibitors (Alirocumab 150 mg by subcutaneous injection&#xD;
      once every 2 weeks or Evolocumab 140 mg by subcutaneous injection once every 2 weeks -&#xD;
      open-label prescription of drugs) while taking Atorvastatin at a dose of 80 mg / day. Group 2&#xD;
      - receiving Ezetimibe at a dose of 10 mg in combination with Atorvastatin 80 mg / day.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 120 patients with ACS admitted on an emergency basis to the Hospital.&#xD;
      All patients will undergo PCI of the infarct-related artery (IRA), as well as intracoronary&#xD;
      imaging with OCT of one or two non-IRA. During hospitalization, patients will receive&#xD;
      standard therapy of ACS according to clinical recommendations, while Atorvastatin will&#xD;
      initially be prescribed at a maximum dosage of 80 mg / day. Patients who showed high&#xD;
      compliance and did not reach the target LDL-C values 1 month after the development of ACS on&#xD;
      the 2nd visit will be randomized into two groups of 60 patients each. Group 1 - taking PCSK9&#xD;
      inhibitors (Alirocumab 150 mg by subcutaneous injection once every 2 weeks or Evolocumab 140&#xD;
      mg by subcutaneous injection once every 2 weeks - open-label prescription of drugs) while&#xD;
      taking Atorvastatin at a dose of 80 mg / day. Group 2 - receiving Ezetimibe at a dose of 10&#xD;
      mg in combination with Atorvastatin 80 mg / day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, on the 2nd visit, patients will undergo coronary artery computed tomography (CCTA):&#xD;
      assessment of the CAVI index and a laboratory tests (blood count, lipid profile, ALAT, ASAT,&#xD;
      Troponin I, Galectin -3, MMP -9, TIMP -1, high-sensitivity CRP, NGAL ). Every 3 months a&#xD;
      visit is planned according to the schedule to monitor the effectiveness (blood count, ALAT,&#xD;
      ASAT, lipid profile).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up duration will be 52 weeks, according to the schedule of visits. At the final visit,&#xD;
      patients will undergo CCTA, CAVI index and laboratory tests (blood count, lipid profile,&#xD;
      ALAT, ASAT, Troponin I, Galectin -3, MMP -9, TIMP -1, high-sensitivity CRP, NGAL).&#xD;
