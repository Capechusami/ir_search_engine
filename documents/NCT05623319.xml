    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, phase 2 trial enrolling patients with untreated&#xD;
      Extensive-Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer (ES SCLC), with a strong translational attitude.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCLC is a very aggressive disease with an overall survival (OS) of 12 months in the extensive&#xD;
      stage (ES). Platinum-based as the first line of treatment has an overall response rate (ORR)&#xD;
      of approximately 70% with a progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.5 months and an OS of almost&#xD;
      10 months. Prophylactic cranial irradiation, performed in order to prevent progression in&#xD;
      brain, one of the major sites of recurrence, was associated with an increase in median&#xD;
      disease-free survival of 12.0-14.7 weeks and in median OS of 5.4-6.7 months with a 1-year&#xD;
      survival rate of 27.1%. At recurrence few therapeutic options are available. In order to&#xD;
      improve clinical results, several strategies are under evaluation. Given the strong activity&#xD;
      shown in several settings, immunotherapy is studied both as a single agent and in&#xD;
      combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab has shown as maintenance after chemotherapy a PFS of 6.9 months in Programmed&#xD;
      Cell Death 1 Ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive patients and as a monotherapy in 2nd and further lines&#xD;
      an ORR of 19.3%, with major responses in PD-L1 positive patients and 61% of responders&#xD;
      lasting ≥18 months. Recently the addition to standard chemotherapy of atezolizumab in&#xD;
      patients with untreated ES-SCLC has led to an improvement of 2 months in OS (12.3 in the&#xD;
      combo arms vs. 10.3 months in the control arm) and a slight improvement in PFS (5.2 vs. 4.3&#xD;
      months, respectively), without new safety data. Similarly addition of durvalumab to standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy has led to a 2.7 months OS improvement (13 in the combo arms vs. 10.3 months in&#xD;
      the control arm) with a relevant improvement in ORR (79.5 vs 70.3% respectively), without any&#xD;
      improvement in PFS. Finally pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy has shown significant&#xD;
      improvement in PFS (hazard ratio (HR), 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.61-0.91) but not&#xD;
      in OS. Finally, considering the role of DNA damage repair systems in the tumorigenesis of&#xD;
      SCLC, Olaparib has been also evaluated together with durvalumab in pre-treated ES-SCLC&#xD;
      obtaining a clinical benefit of 21.1% and confirmed responses or stable disease for ≥8&#xD;
      months. Tumor responses were observed in all instances in which pretreatment tumors showed an&#xD;
      inflamed phenotype. Despite biologic knowledge is growing, no clinically relevant molecular&#xD;
      features have been identified. Recent publications in fact have proposed a new classification&#xD;
      of SCLC in 3 major subgroups according to the expression of the neuronal basic&#xD;
      helix-loop-helix transcription factors achaete-scute homologue 1 (ASCL1), involved in the&#xD;
      neuroendocrine characterization, and the neurogenic differentiation factor 1 (NEUROD1). The&#xD;
      so-called &quot;classic type&quot; shows expression of ASCL1, the &quot;variant type&quot; expresses NEUROD1 and&#xD;
      the third type is negative for both the two previous biomarkers. In terms of gene profiling&#xD;
      these subgroups are distinct but without a clear prognostic and predictive role. No driver&#xD;
      mutations have been found. Many pathways are under evaluations. In particular&#xD;
      Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase (PARP) protein levels are up - regulated in SCLC relative to&#xD;
      other lung cancers. In particular, Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 1 (PARP1) has been found to be&#xD;
      highly expressed at both the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels in SCLC samples. Given&#xD;
      these data the combination proposed (Induction Phase with platinum/etoposide/pembrolizumab&#xD;
      followed by a Maintenance Phase with pembrolizumab/olaparib) may be a new therapeutic option&#xD;
      to be explored for patients. Moreover the evaluation of molecular features performed before,&#xD;
      during and after this treatment may produce new evidence for further clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy&#xD;
      induction followed by maintenance with pembrolizumab and olaparib in terms of&#xD;
      Progression-free Survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with extensive stage (ES) SCLC will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg 1q21 with platinum&#xD;
      compound (cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or carboplatin area under the curve of 5 mg per milliliter per&#xD;
      minute) 1q21 plus etoposide 100 mg/m2 1-3q21 for 4 cycles (Induction Phase) (two additional&#xD;
      cycles are allowed at discretion of the Investigator). In case of responsive or stable&#xD;
      disease, patients will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg 1q21 plus olaparib 300 mg twice daily&#xD;
      until progression (Maintenance Phase) or up to a maximum of 35 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be accrued for a period of 24 months and follow-up will continue for a period&#xD;
      of 12 months after the last patient is enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kaplan-Meier approach will be used to estimate PFS.&#xD;
