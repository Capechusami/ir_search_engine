  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cough is the most unwanted response during bronchoscopic interventions for hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability, hypoxemia, and interruption of interventions. Topical lidocaine is recommended&#xD;
      with a grade evidence in British Thoracic Society guideline. However, severe cough often&#xD;
      induces during the initial bronchoscopic spraying of local anesthesia, follows with uneven&#xD;
      spraying, spasm or arrythmias. In previous reports, there were many drugs and techniques&#xD;
      investigated for preventing cough during broncoscopic spraying. As bronchoscopic&#xD;
      interventions need more space and stability of airways to precisely operate on, few studies&#xD;
      have focused on the effects of different drugs for preventing cough. In this study, Different&#xD;
      intravenous drugs (lidocaine, alfentanil, compared to normal saline) is planned to be&#xD;
      injected one minutes before bronchoscopic insertion, the responses to bronchoscopicly&#xD;
      spraying local anestheticsuch as cough intensity, BIS levels, ANI, Transdermal O2 and CO2,&#xD;
      respiration were recorded and analyzed.&#xD;

      Cough is the most unwanted response during bronchoscopic interventions. Cough could lead to&#xD;
      airway spasm, hemodynamic instability, desaturation, hypoventilation, and then interrupt the&#xD;
      following interventions. In previous reports, lodicaine and other drugs given intravenously,&#xD;
      inhalationally or trans-cricoidally have been investigated for preventing cough during&#xD;
      conventional broncoscopic examinations. As bronchoscopic interventions were goaled to precise&#xD;
      localization and operations with higher yield rate. Steady airways without endotracheal tubes&#xD;
      are usually required. Topical lidocaine is recommended with a grade evidence in British&#xD;
      Thoracic Society guideline. However, severe cough often induces during the initial&#xD;
      bronchoscopic spraying of local anesthesia, follows with uneven spraying, spasm or&#xD;
      arrythmias. There are few studies focused on the effects of different drugs for preventing&#xD;
      cough even bronchoscopic spary of local anesthetics has become the routine pratice before&#xD;
      interventions. In this study, different intravenous drugs (lidocaine, alfentanil, compared to&#xD;
      normal saline) are planned to be injected one minutes before bronchoscopic insertion, the&#xD;
      responses to bronchoscopic spraying local anesthetic were recorded and analyzed. Besdies&#xD;
      cough scores, the following changes are recorded and compared: (1) status on visualization&#xD;
      and the responses to spraying of vocal cords, (2) anesthetic depth (BIS levels), ANI scores&#xD;
      (3) blood pressure and heart beats, (4) data of hemoglobin saturation (SPO2) and Transdermal&#xD;
      O2 and CO2. We goaled to compare the effects of intravenous lidocaine and etomidate on cough&#xD;
      intensity, hemodynamics, ventilation, and bronchoscopic withdrawl rate during bronchoscopic&#xD;
      interventions with intravenous anethesia.&#xD;
