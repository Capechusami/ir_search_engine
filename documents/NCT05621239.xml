  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize descriptively the BNT162b2 vaccination safety&#xD;
      experience among the Indonesian people. We will look at adverse events (AEs) reported in&#xD;
      Indonesia Vaccine Safety Website for people 12 years of age and older. AEs are unwanted&#xD;
      reactions associated with the use of the BNT162b2 vaccine. They may or may not be caused by&#xD;
      this vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary data collection will be exclusively from the Indonesia Vaccine Safety Website&#xD;
      as requested by BPOM. This study does not seek additional participants. We will look at&#xD;
      reported AEs for BNT162b2 vaccine since it became available in Indonesia. Individual data&#xD;
      will be de-identified first before use. This will help protect personal information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study the AEs associated with the BNT162b2 vaccine in several ways. These include the&#xD;
      type of AEs and which body parts affected, among others. This will help us understand it the&#xD;
      vaccine is safe in Indonesian people.&#xD;
