      This is a long-term, 3-year, follow-up study for patients completing the KS-GIG-001-01 Study&#xD;
      (A Phase 1/2a, First-in-Human, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety&#xD;
      and Therapeutic Activity of Single Ascending Doses of KLS-2031 Administered by Transforaminal&#xD;
      Epidural Injection in Patients with Neuropathic Pain from Lumbosacral Radiculopathy).&#xD;
      Following the end of the Open-label Safety Extension Period of the KS-GIG-001-01 Study (Visit&#xD;
      14), patients will enter the Long-term Follow-up Period. These patients will continue to be&#xD;
      monitored for AEs (including AEs of special interest) and serious AEs (SAEs) via phone call&#xD;
      every 6 months and outpatient visits every 52 weeks (annually), over 3 years.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline to each visit in Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS) score = Result at week n - baseline, (n=52, 104, 156)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52, Week 104, Week 156</time_frame>
    <description>The PI-NRS is measured on an 11-point numerical scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) that the patient selects to best describe the intensity of pain that they have experienced in the last 24 hours.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to each visit in Daily Sleep Interference Scale (DSIS) score = Result at week n - baseline, (n=52, 104, 156)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52, Week 104, Week 156</time_frame>
    <description>The DSIS has an 11-point numerical scale that asks the patient to assess how pain has interfered with their sleep during the past 24 hours. Response options range from 0 (does not interfere with sleep) to 10 (completely interferes with sleep).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to each visit in Galer Neuropathic Pain Scale (Galer NPS) score = Result at week n - baseline, (n=52, 104, 156)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52, Week 104, Week 156</time_frame>
    <description>The Galer NPS is a relatively simple, self-administered, 10-item questionnaire for evaluating pain, which assesses distinct pain qualities associated with neuropathic pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to each visit in modified Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score = Result at week n - baseline, (n=52, 104, 156)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52, Week 104, Week 156</time_frame>
    <description>The modified RMDQ is a self-administered, 24-question physical disability measurement tool that evaluates both back and leg pain. Each of the 24 questions is asked 2 times, once with regard to back pain and once with regard to leg pain, for a total of 48 items. Each question requires a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer; 1 point is scored for each positive response. The total scores are determined on a scale of 0 to 24 for back pain and on a scale of 0 to 24 for leg pain, with 0 representing &quot;no disability&quot; and 24 representing &quot;extreme disability.&quot;</description>
