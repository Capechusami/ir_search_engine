    <measure>Change from Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status Score and Physical Function Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to approximately 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire that rates the overall quality of life in cancer participants. The first 28 questions use a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much) for evaluating function (physical, role, social, cognitive, emotional), symptoms (diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, nausea/vomiting, constipation, and pain) and financial difficulties. The last 2 questions use a 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent) to evaluate overall health and quality of life. Global scores are converted to a score of 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating improved health status. The change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 score will be presented.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and up to approximately 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-CX24 is a questionnaire that rates the symptoms common to women with cervical cancer and evaluates the impact of disease and/or treatments. The 24 items use a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much) and are classified into 3 multi-item scales, 11 items with symptom experience, 3 items with body image, and 4 items with sexual/ vaginal functioning. The other items of the questionnaire are lymphedema, peripheral neuropathy, menopausal symptom, sexual worry, sexual activity, and sexual enjoyment. The change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-CX24 score will be presented.</description>

    <description>Participants receive envafolimab 150 mg subcutaneously (SC) on Day 1 of each week cycle (QW) for 8 cycles followed by envafolimab 300 mg SC on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle (Q3W) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, investigator determines that the participant cannot continue to benefit, withdraws informed consent, or envafolimab treatment over 2 years. During the QW dosing period of envafolimab, participants receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The standard of care chemoradiotherapy regimen includes cisplatin 40 mg/m^2 IV once per week (QW) for 5 or 6 weeks plus external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) followed by brachytherapy with minimum total radiotherapy dose of 45 Gray Units (Gy)with the total duration of radiation treatment not to exceed 56 days.</description>
