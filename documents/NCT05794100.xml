  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial aiming at evaluating the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tolerance of 3 sugar replacers mixes at 3 different doses. The investigators&#xD;
      will also try to understand the factors that could explain the presence or absence of&#xD;
      symptoms&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial with 23 visits consisting of one&#xD;
      screening visit, one baseline visit, and 21 study visits (10 test periods each consisting of&#xD;
      2 test visits and one drop-off visit) across 11 weeks. For this study, 60 generally healthy&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to a test sequence and will consume one control product and nine&#xD;
      test products over the course of the study. Before consumption of any study products, breath&#xD;
      hydrogen lactulose assessment and collection of stool samples for microbiome analysis will be&#xD;
      completed. Additionally, midway through the study, data will be reviewed in a blinded manner&#xD;
      and a stool sample will be collected from a subset of 30 subjects for in vitro fermentation&#xD;
      tests. Gastrointestinal symptoms and stool information will be collected using the&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal Tolerance Questionnaire (GITQ) and Bowel Habit Diary with Bristol Stool&#xD;
      Scale (BHD-BSS). The GITQ and BHD-BSS will be administered for 3 days and 7 days prior to&#xD;
      study product consumption, respectively. Additionally, the GITQ and BHD-BSS will be collected&#xD;
      throughout the day of study product consumption and the 2 days after product consumption.&#xD;
      24-h urine samples will be collected after study product consumption for urinary allulose&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;

             gastric reflux, indigestion, dyspepsia, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, history of&#xD;
             surgery for weight loss, gastroparesis, and clinically significant lactose or gluten&#xD;

             such as nausea/vomiting or diarrhea (defined as ≥3 loose or liquid stools/d).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Self-reported history (within 6 weeks of Visit 1; Day -11) of constipation or diarrhea&#xD;
             at the discretion of the Clinical Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Uncontrolled and/or clinically important pulmonary (including uncontrolled asthma),&#xD;
             cardiac (including, but not limited to, atherosclerotic disease, history of myocardial&#xD;

             Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus), hematologic, immunologic, neurologic (such as&#xD;
             Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease), psychiatric (including depression and/or anxiety&#xD;
             disorders) or biliary disorders. Conditions which are well-controlled or resolved will&#xD;
             be assessed by the Clinical Investigator on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood&#xD;
             pressure ≥90 mm Hg) as defined by the blood pressure measured at Visit 1 (Day -11).&#xD;
             One re-test will be allowed on a separate day prior to Visit 2 (Day 0), for subjects&#xD;
             whose blood pressure exceeds either of these cut points at Visit 1 (Day -11), in the&#xD;
             judgment of the Clinical Investigator. If taken, the repeat blood pressure measurement&#xD;
             will be used to determine eligibility. Stable use of hypertension medication is&#xD;
             allowed [defined as no change in medication regimen within the 3 mo prior to Visit 1&#xD;
             (Day -11)].&#xD;
