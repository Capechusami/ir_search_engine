    <textblock>
      Septic shock is a serious infectious condition characterized by low blood pressure and&#xD;
      multiple organ damage. One of the traditional recommendations is to administer intravenous&#xD;
      fluids as the first step to improve blood pressure(1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, studies have shown that not every patient benefits from aggressive intravenous&#xD;
      hydration (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that certain parameters may correlate with volume status and&#xD;
      others may not to correlate with patient volume status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic parameters, such as stroke volume variation (SVV) and pleth variability index&#xD;
      (PVI) may better predict fluid responsiveness. However, assessments of these parameters&#xD;
      require invasive procedures and special monitoring equipment, which limits their clinical&#xD;
      application (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography has been widely adopted to diagnose and monitor cardiac dysfunction leading&#xD;
      to hemodynamic instability, and shock pathophysiology in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the echocardiographic information on macro-hemodynamics is partial, especially as&#xD;
      being indirect as concerns vascular tone, and not allowing any inference on end-organ&#xD;
      perfusion (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, ultrasonography for estimating volume status has been widely recommended because of&#xD;
      its non-invasive nature, ease of acquisition, and reproducibility of measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inferior vena cava (IVC) is a compliant vessel whose size and shape vary with changes in&#xD;
      CVP and intravascular volume. Therefore, sonographic measurement of the IVC represents an&#xD;
      effective and non-invasive method of estimating CVP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory variation in the IVC diameter was used as a guide for fluid therapy in septic&#xD;
      shock in both spontaneous breathing and mechanically ventilated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the assessment of visceral end-organ perfusion by ultrasound, may offer insights&#xD;
      into this facet of shock pathophysiology (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among these ultrasound modalities, corrected flow time (FTc) measured in the carotid artery&#xD;
      is a new approach for predicting fluid responsiveness that has shown promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, although it is a dynamic index, it may be able to adequately evaluate volume&#xD;
      status in spontaneously and mechanically breathing patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work: 1- To evaluate whether carotid FTc as determined by Doppler ultrasound could&#xD;
      be a predictor of fluid responsiveness in spontaneously breathing and mechanically ventilated&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2- To evaluate the predictive ability of ΔVpeak for fluid responsiveness in spontaneously&#xD;
      breathing patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3- To detect changes of regional splanchnic hemodynamics by color Doppler resistive index,&#xD;
      and its improvement after fluid administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4- To evaluate the predictive ability of IVC collapsibility and distensibility indices for&#xD;
      fluid responsiveness in septic shock patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5- To compare between the predictive ability of the measured Ultrasonographic parameters and&#xD;
      the CVP changes in response to intravenous fluid therapy in both spontaneously breathing and&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated septic shock patients.&#xD;

        measured again.&#xD;
