  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about treatment for people with B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      that did not respond to treatment or that has gotten worse after treatment. The aim of this&#xD;
      trial is to answer the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If it is realistic to give people radiation treatment before they receive a chimeric&#xD;
           antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell treatment for their cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If it is safe to give people radiation treatment before they receive a CAR T-cell&#xD;
           treatment for their cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of low-dose radiation therapy in the&#xD;
      bridging period between chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell collection, manufacturing, and&#xD;
      infusion (vein-to-vein) in patients with relapsed and refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging cellular immunotherapies including CAR T-cell therapy have produced remarkable&#xD;
      outcomes for this population. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved&#xD;
      lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) for the management of people with relapsed and refractory&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoma. Unfortunately, many patients undergoing liso-cel infusion will suffer&#xD;
      progression or relapse with devastating consequences. The object of this study is to identify&#xD;
      a novel means to enhance liso-cel activity to improve overall outcomes. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the addition of radiation therapy targeting selected sites as bridging&#xD;
      therapy prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy and liso-cel infusion will be effective at&#xD;
      improving responses for patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study will provide key justification to expand this therapeutic approach&#xD;
      into a larger phase II clinical trial powered to examine the efficacy of this approach.&#xD;
