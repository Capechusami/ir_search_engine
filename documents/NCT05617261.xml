  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational study is to evaluate patient reported outcomes and&#xD;
      tolerability of scrotal and penile urologic procedures under the administration of minimal&#xD;
      conscious sedation. This will be assessed at 4-6 weeks post-procedure where patients will be&#xD;
      followed up with a questionnaire assessing how well patients tolerated the procedure and if&#xD;
      patients would opt for conscious sedation again in a similar, future procedure. The&#xD;
      investigators will secondarily be assessing the associated cost savings as compared to having&#xD;
      these procedures performed under general anesthesia at a tertiary care hospital.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care for the vast majority of urological procedures is the&#xD;
      administration of general anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, or anesthesia-delivered sedation -&#xD;
      requiring the operating room. However, this poses significant challenges associated with&#xD;
      operating room costs, resources, and patient wait times. Given lengthy surgical backlogs,&#xD;
      priority is focused on more acute conditions such as malignancies that require immediate&#xD;
      intervention. Procedures for non-acute conditions, such as penile and scrotal procedures,&#xD;
      have wait times that can exceed six months. Since most treatment for penile and scrotal cases&#xD;
      tends to be surgical intervention, delays in these procedures may significantly negatively&#xD;
      impact patients' sexual health, relationships, mental health, and quality of life. The&#xD;
      ability to perform these procedures outside of the operating room using local anesthesia with&#xD;
      or without conscious sedation may significantly reduce patient wait times and the costs of&#xD;
      surgical intervention. Furthermore, the use of conscious sedation would allow for faster&#xD;
      post-operative recovery, shorter procedural times, and decreased risks/side effects&#xD;
      associated with general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fields such as plastic surgery have successfully transitioned certain procedures into a&#xD;
      clinic- based setting and the field of urology had also shown a similar interest. The&#xD;
      investigators research team has been at the forefront of this transition - previously&#xD;
      demonstrating the efficacy of distal ureteroscopy under nursing administered conscious&#xD;
      sedation and other common urologic procedures. However, these studies were limited as they&#xD;
      did not examine invasive scrotal and penile procedures, which have an extraordinary impact on&#xD;
      the sexual health of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will provide evidence on the efficacy and characteristics of successful penile&#xD;
      and scrotal procedures conducted under the administration of local anesthesia with or without&#xD;
      conscious sedation. The findings of this study will help transition additional urological&#xD;
      procedures into a clinic-based setting safely: improving the sexual and mental health of&#xD;
      patients while decreasing cost, wait times, procedure duration, recovery times, and&#xD;
      anesthetic-related complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a prospective study. Eligible patients at the Manitoba Men's Health&#xD;
      Clinic (Winnipeg, MB, Canada) will be approached for potential enrollment. Procedures with or&#xD;
      without conscious sedation are routinely performed at this clinic with volumes of 15-20&#xD;
      procedures performed weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be approached individually for potential recruitment into the study. Prior to&#xD;
      their urological procedure, patients will be seen by a member of the research team to&#xD;
      determine if they are willing to participate in the study. These meetings will occur in the&#xD;
      pre-operative waiting room at the Manitoba Men's Health Clinic where a member of the research&#xD;
      team who is involved in the care of that patient, will review the medical chart to ensure the&#xD;
      candidate meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the study. After discussing the&#xD;
      study, potential participants will have the opportunity to decide whether they would like to&#xD;
      be involved or not. Those who choose to be involved in the study will have to sign an&#xD;
      informed consent form. Patients may withdraw consent and terminate participation at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be assigned a study number to track them over time. Electronic data&#xD;
      forms will be used to collect preliminary information for all patients who consent to the&#xD;
      study. Baseline variables for collection will include patient age, sex, BMI, co-morbidities,&#xD;
      medications, smoking/drinking/illicit substance use, and family history of notable diseases.&#xD;
      Clinical variables collected will include procedure side (where applicable), medication dose&#xD;
      used for sedation, quantity and type of local anesthetic, procedural and recovery times,&#xD;
      patient-reported and surgeon-reported visual analogue scale pre-, intra-, and post-operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical tests will include univariable and multivariable analyses. All the variables&#xD;
      defined above in the data collection section will be analyzed to determine if there is an&#xD;
      association between any of these variables and the patient-reported outcomes after the&#xD;
      urological procedure. Normally distributed continuous data will be reported as the mean Â± the&#xD;
      standard deviation. Non-normally distributed data will be presented using the median and the&#xD;
      interquartile range. Multivariable adjusted logistic regression analysis will be used to&#xD;
      assess predictors of whether a patient would opt for conscious sedation again as opposed to&#xD;
      general/spinal anesthesia. SPSS Version 24.0 (SPSS Inc, IBM, Chicago, IL) will be used for&#xD;
      data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal Health Information Act (PHIA) compliance of the investigators database will be&#xD;
      ensured by preventing unauthorized access and implementing security measures such as password&#xD;
      protecting the electronic database and never permanently storing the database on a mobile&#xD;
      device or flash drive. Data will only be stored on the desktop computer enclosed in the&#xD;
      Manitoba Men's Health Clinic. Database information will only be emailed using a password-&#xD;
      protected, encrypted file. Information presented at meetings and conferences will be de-&#xD;
      identified and anonymous. The Research Ethics Board has approved this study at the University&#xD;
      of Manitoba.&#xD;
