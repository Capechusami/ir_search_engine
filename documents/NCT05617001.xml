  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AliveCor (www.alivecor.com) has developed an ECG device (KardiaMobile) that interfaces with&#xD;
      iOS and Android smartphones and tablets. This ECG consists of a lightweight hardware case&#xD;
      with two metal electrodes that can snap onto the back of the phone and a software&#xD;
      application. By holding the right finger(s) on the right electrode and the left finger(s) on&#xD;
      the left electrode, an electrical circuit is completed and a lead-I, 30 second rhythm strip&#xD;
      is created. KardiaMobile and a newer device, KardiaMobile 6L, were approved by FDA for ECG&#xD;
      rhythm recording. Recently, AliveCor developed a new device: Kardia 12L to record 12-lead&#xD;
      ECGs. However, the data generated from the new device has not yet been validated for&#xD;
      accuracy. The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy and safety of the AC 12L&#xD;
      ECG System. The ECGs collected by the AC 12L ECG System will be compared to simultaneous&#xD;
      standard- of-care 12-lead ECG, recorded using the GE CardioSoft 12-lead ECG System. The ECGs&#xD;
      will be analyzed for accuracy based on statistical difference using root-mean-square error,&#xD;
      and cross correlation between the simultaneous 10 second recordings as well as the median&#xD;
      beats of all 12 leads.&#xD;

    <description>The purpose of this study is to collect clinical validation data to support an FDA submission for a 510(k) for the Kardia 12L hardware which enables the simultaneous diagnostic quality recording of all 6 limb leads and any chest lead. We will be recording both Leads V1 and V2 in a sequential fashion along with the V4 and Limb leads and a simultaneous 12-lead ECG to validate the hardware and a Deep Neural Network model which expands the 5 leads into a complete 12-lead ECG. The 12-lead ECG used for validation of the recordings and the 12-lead synthesis model is the GE Cardiosoft System which is FDA cleared.</description>
