    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effect of different intensity of&#xD;
      repeated low-level red-light (RLRL) therapy on the choroidal and retinal blood flow among&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repeated low-level red-light (RLRL) therapy is an emerging innovative and non-invasive&#xD;
      treatment for a variety of eye diseases. Notably, RLRL was found to be effective in&#xD;
      thickening choroidal thickness in a 1-year randomized controlled trial, indicating its&#xD;
      potential in modulating blood flow in the fundus. However, it remains unclear how long it&#xD;
      takes for the RLRL to make a difference in fundus blood flow and whether there is a&#xD;
      dose-response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the different wavelengths of of repeated low level&#xD;
      light therapy on the choroidal and retinal blood flow among adults. This study will be&#xD;
      conducted with a randomized cross-over design with a total follow-up of 3 months. The&#xD;
      repeated low level light therapy will be carried out in the study site under supervision&#xD;
      according to a standard protocol. Detailed ophthalmic examinations, including visual acuity,&#xD;
      intraocular pressure, optical coherence tomography/angiography, optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      angiography, cycloplegic spherical equivalent refraction, slit lamp, and biological&#xD;
      parameters will be evaluated at enrollment and during follow-ups.&#xD;
