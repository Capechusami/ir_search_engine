  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 170 patients male or female who are carrying SS or Sbeta0 versions of the beta&#xD;
      globin gene will be included in the study. The subjects will be assigned with 1:1:1 ratio of&#xD;
      either NUV001 Immediate release IR or NUV001 Gastro resistant GR or Placebo. The treatment&#xD;
      duration of the study will be 90 days which has in total 5 visits. The primary end point of&#xD;
      this study is to check the safety and tolerance of the orally administered nutraceutical&#xD;
      supplement. This endpoint will be checked by assessing the Adverse events, Vital signs of the&#xD;
      subject and the Change in hematological parameters from Baseline to Final visit.&#xD;
