    <textblock>
      This study is a multicentre, prospective, randomised trial, aims to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Irinotecan Drug-Eluting Beads combined with regorafenib as the third-line treatment&#xD;
      for a patient with colorectal cancer liver metastases. The study is planned to enrolled 126&#xD;
      patients failing first- and second-line standard chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;

    <description>OS is defined as the time from date of randomization to death due to any cause. Subjects still alive at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of last contact.</description>

    <description>The PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the date of first documented PD or death as a result of any cause, whichever occurred first. When a patient was alive and without progression, PFS was censored at the date of the last disease assessment.</description>
