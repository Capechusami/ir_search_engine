      Aim: In this study, it is aimed to determine the effect of sexual education given to pregnant&#xD;
      women on attitudes towards sexuality and sexual response during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in two different groups. After the women are evaluated in terms&#xD;
      of eligibility criteria for the research, the eligible pregnant women will be informed about&#xD;
      the research and written informed consent will be obtained from those who accept. Random&#xD;
      distribution of pregnant women to study groups will be made using the Block Randomization&#xD;
      method. The following applications will be made to the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Education Group: Women in the experimental group will be given education on sexual life&#xD;
      during pregnancy. Before the training, preliminary data will be collected and then the&#xD;
      participants will be given two hours of individual and face-to-face training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the training, homework will be given to pregnant women to practice at home,&#xD;
      including &quot;sharing their sexual feelings and thoughts with their spouse, sharing problems and&#xD;
      concerns about sexuality during pregnancy, and using alternative ways other than sexual&#xD;
      intercourse. In addition, a &quot;Sexual Life in Pregnancy Information Booklet&quot; will be given, and&#xD;
      they will be asked to read the information in the booklet and share it with their spouses.&#xD;
      After 4 weeks, the data sheets will be applied again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: Patients in the control group of the study will not be subjected to any&#xD;
      treatment other than the routine procedure. Data collection forms will be applied to the&#xD;
      patients in the control group at the beginning of the study and after 4 weeks.&#xD;
