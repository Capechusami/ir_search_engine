  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine whether an investigational medication called ketamine&#xD;
      is able to improve treatment outcomes for tobacco use disorder when delivered in conjunction&#xD;
      with brief motivational enhancement therapy. Participants will receive ketamine assisted&#xD;
      motivational enhancement therapy weekly for three weeks and there will be 2 follow up visits.&#xD;
      All visits will also consist of questionnaires and saliva samples will be taken. The overall&#xD;
      participation will last approximately 8 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome of this study will be the feasibility of using ketamine-assisted treatment for smoking cessation, which will assess the number of people selected for randomization that complete the full treatment. This will help determine if the treatment of ketamine in tobacco use would be beneficial for further study.</description>
