  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is the most frequently observed chronic complication of deep&#xD;
      vein thrombosis (DVT), with an estimated cumulative incidence of 20-50%. Endovascular venous&#xD;
      recanalization with angioplasty and stenting of obstructive lesions is the recommended&#xD;
      treatment option to reduce or correct the symptoms of DVT. However, its impact on the&#xD;
      physical capacity and breathlessness of patients has not been fully demonstrated. The&#xD;
      heterogeneous evidences of clinical improvement is probably related to the presence or&#xD;
      absence of collateral veins developed in these patients with proximal venous obstruction&#xD;
      (iliac or iliofemoral with or without inferior vena cava involvement), which ensure the&#xD;
      cardiac venous return. The aim of this study is to compare changes in maximal oxygen uptake&#xD;
      after endovascular venous recanalization in DVT patients and to evaluate the hemodynamic,&#xD;
      respiratory and muscular improvement induced by the restoration of venous flow in the&#xD;
      occluded segments.&#xD;
