  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of fall in older adults aged 65 and over is estimated at 30%, and 50% of the&#xD;
      people aged 80 and over with at least one fall a year. Falls are associated with significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The origin falls is often multifactorial, involving intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Few&#xD;
      studies have investigated the association with all antidepressants. Potential adverse effects&#xD;
      of antidepressants such as hyponatremia, sedation, orthostatic hypotension, extrapyramidal&#xD;
      symptoms are known risk factors for falls. Due to multimorbidity, polypharmacy including&#xD;
      interaction risks, and aging-related changes in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic of drugs,&#xD;
      antidepressants may further increase this risk in older patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the World Health Organization global database, the main objective of this study is&#xD;
      to investigate the association between antidepressants classes and the occurrence of falls&#xD;
      reported in the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A disproportionality analysis will be performed. It will aim to assess whether some classes&#xD;
      of antidepressants, and within these classes some molecules, are associated with a greater&#xD;
      risk of falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mediation analysis will also be performed. It will aim to examine some of the mediators&#xD;
      involved in the association between antidepressants classes and falls.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators describe the profile of patients who are reported in the WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION Vigibase pharmacovigilance database, as having experienced a fall. In particular, the number of patients who use antidepressants (Non-selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors, Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, Selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, Alpha-2-adrenergic receptor antagonists, Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, other antidepressants), the number of patients who presented associated illnesses known to induce falls, the number of patients who presented associated drug prescriptions known to induce falls.</description>
