  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robotic arthroplasty is increasing in acceptance on a global scale as a result of&#xD;
      advancements in orthopedic surgery technology. The investigators aimed to share their&#xD;
      anesthesia management experience as well as compare robotic unilateral total hip arthroplasty&#xD;
      with conventional surgical technique in this retrospective study.&#xD;

      This study was conducted after obtaining ethics committee approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria were as follows: American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical&#xD;
      status I-III patients between 40-85 years, elective unilateral THAs which were performed by a&#xD;
      single senior orthopedic surgeon and orthopedic team between January 2021 and January 2023&#xD;
      under CSEA. Exclusion criteria were urgent surgery, bilateral surgery, previous surgery,&#xD;
      missing data, and lost to follow-up in the perioperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The routine anesthetic protocol for the TKA was as follows: A single dose of 0.5% hyperbaric&#xD;
      bupivacaine between 15-10 mg was administered intratechally. Following this the epidural&#xD;
      catheter was inserted 4 cm into the epidural space through the epidural needle and secured.&#xD;
      The level of the sensory block was assessed using pin-prick and cold sensation tests, and&#xD;
      motor block using the Bromage scale. The patients were followed in the postanesthesia care&#xD;
      unit (PACU) after the surgery. Patients with a modified Aldrete scoring system â‰¥9 were&#xD;
      considered to be eligible for the transfer from PACU to the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain was evaluated using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with regular intervals. Data were&#xD;
      collected from hospital's electronic database records, patient files, and anesthesia charts.&#xD;
