  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This double-blinded clinical trial randomly assigns participants with refractory cutaneous&#xD;
      warts to receive either treatment with the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine or a placebo to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of HPV vaccination for the treatment of refractory cutaneous warts.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous warts are a common cause for medical office visits and are frequently encountered&#xD;
      in dermatology practice. Despite their benign nature, cutaneous warts can be painful,&#xD;
      disfiguring, persistent and may be associated with significant morbidity. Numerous&#xD;
      therapeutic options are available, including local destruction, virucidal agents, topical and&#xD;
      systemic antiproliferative medications, and immunotherapy. Unfortunately, no single therapy&#xD;
      is uniformly effective, and patients often receive multiple courses of treatment&#xD;
      (cryotherapy, curettage, Candida antigen injection, etc.) without improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An efficacious therapy for cutaneous warts is sorely needed and treatment with HPV&#xD;
      vaccination is being increasingly reported. Notably, individual cases and case series have&#xD;
      reported complete resolution of multiple treatment refractory warts after treatment with the&#xD;
      quadrivalent HPV vaccine. Even more encouraging, a larger retrospective study of 30 patients&#xD;
      found that up to 60% of patients had a complete or partial response after treatment with the&#xD;
      HPV vaccine. Additional benefits of treatment with HPV vaccination include ease of use, less&#xD;
      tissue destruction and pain, and the potential for less frequent medical office visits.&#xD;
      Despite these promising preliminary data, a larger, randomized controlled study has yet to be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 120&#xD;
      participants. Enrolled participants will be randomized to treatment with either HPV&#xD;
      vaccination or placebo. Participants will receive injections with the 9-valent HPV vaccine or&#xD;
      placebo at 0, 4, and 20 weeks and follow up until 24 weeks to determine their treatment&#xD;
      response, quality of life and the safety and tolerability of HPV vaccination.&#xD;
