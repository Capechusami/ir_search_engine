  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunological factors are assumed to be determinants for some psychiatric disorders, thus&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs may be helpful. However, studies on such treatments are scarce. An&#xD;
      inflammatory modulating drug rituximab, cluster of differentiation antigen 20 antibodies&#xD;
      (anti-CD20 antibodies), is a standard treatment for e.g. multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to test rituximab in a randomised placebo-controlled double-blinded,&#xD;
      add-on treatment trial in 120 participants (18-55 years) with schizophrenia spectrum&#xD;
      disorder. Sampling from blood for analyses of inflammatory mediators are investigated at gene&#xD;
      and protein levels and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and&#xD;
      lumbar puncture are optional. Biomarkers will be investigated in relation to treatment&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family member(s) to the patient will be asked to participate in a qualitative interview by a&#xD;
      researcher after 3 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Immunological factors are assumed to be determinants for some psychiatric disorders, thus&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs may be helpful. However, studies on such treatments are scarce.&#xD;
      Rituximab (anti-CD20 antibodies), a standard treatment for multiple sclerosis in Sweden, is&#xD;
      an inflammatory modulating drug. In a small open pilot trial, markedly ill,&#xD;
      treatment-resistant participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorder were treated with a&#xD;
      single- dose rituximab (1000 mg), as add-on treatment to antipsychotics in Örebro, Sweden&#xD;
      (2019-2022). Large improvements in all types of psychotic symptoms were evident, with&#xD;
      long-lasting effects and few side-effects in most of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a proof-of-concept study based on our earlier findings. The investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, add-on intervention study for 104&#xD;
      participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorder (18-51 years). Sampling from blood for&#xD;
      analyses of inflammatory mediators are investigated at gene and protein levels and rsfMRI and&#xD;
      lumbar puncture are optional. Biomarkers will be investigated in relation to treatment&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are assessed at five time-points; week 0, 2, 7, 12 (endpoint I) and 24 (endpoint&#xD;
      II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I Does the addition of rituximab to standard psychiatric treatment improve psychotic symptoms&#xD;
      in SSD?&#xD;
&#xD;
      II Does overall disability improve with the addition of rituximab?&#xD;
&#xD;
      III Are clinical or biological markers related to treatment response?&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV Is rituximab safe and well tolerated by participants with SSD?&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition family member(s) to the patient will be asked to participate in a qualitative&#xD;
      interview by a researcher after 3 months on changes in the patient's mood and anxiety level,&#xD;
      general functioning, behaviours, energy level, psychotic symptoms, motivation, emotional&#xD;
      reciprocity and insight to enable a qualitative analysis. We will also ask them about their&#xD;
      general thoughts on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also aim study changes in negative symptoms with the Motivation and pleasure- self&#xD;
      report (MAP-SR) in addition to the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scale.&#xD;
