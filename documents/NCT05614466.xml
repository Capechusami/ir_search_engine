      This study will be conducted in three parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: A prospective open label pilot intervention study, comparing the proportion of people&#xD;
      with hepatitis B who are managed by their GP in primary care settings before, 12 months and&#xD;
      24 months after implementation of the Simply B electronic hepatitis B support package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: A nested qualitative health services feasibility study using semi -structured&#xD;
      interviews and thematic analysis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Simply B electronic GP support package consists of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Semi-automated hepatitis B case-finding in the primary care clinic using clinic EMR&#xD;
           software&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Automated blood test ordering using clinic EMR software&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A simplified hepatitis B treatment algorithm and online e-support tool that provides the&#xD;
           GP with a simplified management plan based on clinical data entered into the tool by&#xD;
           generating a hepatitis B chronic disease management plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Automated rapid linkage to specialist support through the e-support tool, with a follow&#xD;
           up call from a specialist nurse provided within two business days of the initial&#xD;
           patient/GP consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Clinical data collection through the e-support tool into an online secure database,&#xD;
           visible by the GP and hospital specialist, allowing automated reminders and monitoring&#xD;
           of timely and appropriate hepatitis B management steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Linkage of de-identified data drawn from the Simply B database to the ACCESS and PATRON&#xD;
           surveillance network to allow monitoring of progress toward National Strategy Hepatitis&#xD;
           B treatment targets in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The e-support tool is based on an online RedCAP database accessible to both the GP and St&#xD;
      Vincent's hospital specialist team via different interfaces and stored securely on the St&#xD;
      Vincent's Hospital Cloud. The investigators have partnered with the Future Health Today (FHT)&#xD;
      software development team (University of Melbourne) to integrate the Simply B e-support&#xD;
      package into primary care electronic medical record software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GP enters demographic and pathology result data into a simple online data entry form.&#xD;
      Based on a simplified hepatitis B management algorithm, this determines treatment eligibility&#xD;
      and immediately generates an automatic patient management plan. For clinics that are part of&#xD;
      the FHT network, FHT extracts demographic and pathology result data automatically and&#xD;
      populates the Simply B tool, therefore the GP does not need to manually enter any data.&#xD;
      Instructions of how to treat, monitor and perform liver cancer surveillance are included in&#xD;
      the automated management plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hospital specialist nurse and specialist clinicians have online access to the 'back end'&#xD;
      of the Simply B e-support tool database, allowing them to monitor and enter data. This&#xD;
      database contains all the demographic and clinical data entered by the GP in the e-support&#xD;
      tool data entry form and automatically generates dates for follow up review, including date&#xD;
      of next liver cancer surveillance if the patient fulfils eligibility criteria. Upcoming&#xD;
      milestone appointments trigger alert emails to the GP and specialist hepatitis nurses&#xD;
      facilitating timely hepatitis B management.&#xD;
