  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the strongest risk factors for cancer in children and adolescents is being born with a&#xD;
      congenital anomaly. In fact, data from registry linkage studies imply that 10-15% of&#xD;
      childhood cancer risk could be attributable to having a congenital anomaly. As an estimated&#xD;
      10 million children worldwide are born with a congenital anomaly per year, the public health&#xD;
      implications of identifying why some of these children develop cancer are thus substantial.&#xD;
      While these studies have been informative, registry data alone offers no possibility of&#xD;
      molecular or sequencing studies to identify the specific genetic basis underlying the&#xD;
      co-occurrence of anomalies and cancer susceptibility. Therefore, the investigators developed&#xD;
      the first phase of the Genetic Overlap Between Anomalies and Cancer in Kids (GOBACK) Study to&#xD;
      address these limitations. Using data from birth defects and cancer registries from four&#xD;
      states, the investigators identified numerous novel specific anomaly-cancer associations. In&#xD;
      the GOBACK Study the investigators identified an increase in cancer risk among children with&#xD;
      any chromosomal abnormality and any non-chromosomal birth defect. Additionally, children with&#xD;
      congenital anomalies developed a variety of cancers, therefore the investigators propose to&#xD;
      evaluate a range of cancers among children with congenital anomalies. By pooling registry&#xD;
      data across four states in the GOBACK Study, the investigators found that children with&#xD;
      non-chromosomal birth defects have a significantly elevated risk of several childhood&#xD;
      cancers. Notably several of these congenital anomalies are not characteristic of known cancer&#xD;
      predisposition syndromes. Therefore, our preliminary studies lay the framework for this&#xD;
      application. The objectives of the current study are to (1) interrogate the genomes of&#xD;
      children with co-occurring non-chromosomal congenital anomalies and cancer enrolled in&#xD;
      Project:EveryChild to identify genetic features associated with these combined phenotypes,&#xD;
      and (2) verify congenital anomalies and determine the phenotypic spectrum among children with&#xD;
      cancer enrolled in Project:EveryChild with self-reported congenital anomalies (&quot;deep&#xD;
      phenotyping&quot;). For this study the investigators will utilize Project:EveryChild to identify,&#xD;
      contact, and enroll case-parent trios for children with co-occurring non-chromosomal&#xD;
      congenital anomalies and cancers. From each enrolled family the investigators e will collect&#xD;
      DNA from the affected case and one or both biological parents to comprise each case-parent&#xD;
      trio. The investigators will include siblings if available. The investigators will also&#xD;
      characterize case-parent trios based on demographic and clinical characteristics utilizing&#xD;
      information collected via self-administered questionnaires and medical records. Ultimately&#xD;
      the findings from this study could lead to 1) determining the potential genetic mechanisms&#xD;
      that underlie these co-occurring conditions; 2) improving cancer risk-management strategies&#xD;
      among children with birth defects; and 3) identifying the role congenital anomalies play in&#xD;
      outcomes and survivorship among children diagnosed with cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Analyze de novo single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variants (CNVs), and insertions/deletions (INDELs) obtained through whole-genome sequencing of co-occurring non-chromosomal congenital anomalies and cancer case-parent trios, which are necessary to identify genes with de novo mutations. The investigators plan to enroll a maximum of 1,000 case-parent trios. For individuals on COG therapeutic studies, no treatment outcomes would be requested or reported as part of this study.</description>

    <description>The patient must have been diagnosed with cancer at â‰¤25 years of age and have been diagnosed with one or more congenital anomalies reported through the APEC14B1 registry intake data. For all patients in APEC14B1 with self-reported congenital anomalies the investigators will: 1) recruit cases; 2) administer the GOBACK Study questionnaire; 3) collect biological samples for sequencing; and 4) obtain medical records to verify anomalies. Medical records will be used to validate self-reported congenital anomalies and is a crucial step prior to sequencing. Additionally, the investigators will be able to identify those with well-established cancer predisposition syndromes that involve congenital anomalies, such as WAGR syndrome.</description>
