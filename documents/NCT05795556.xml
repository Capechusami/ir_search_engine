  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the last decades there has been an increase in the relative proportion and life&#xD;
      expectancy of elderly people. Hence, the number of elderly with diseases and disabilities&#xD;
      related to aging will increase and consequently, age-related losses in skeletal muscle mass&#xD;
      and physical function represents an important current and future public health issue.&#xD;
      Sarcopenia is a progressive and generalized skeletal muscle disorder that is considered&#xD;
      central to the development of physical deconditioning and untreated sarcopenia is linked to&#xD;
      falls, morbidity, and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying mechanisms behind the progressive loss of muscle mass and function associated&#xD;
      with aging are yet unknown but seems to be multifactorial. A decrease in physical activity&#xD;
      level and an altered central and peripheral nervous system innervation have been identified&#xD;
      as some of the contributing factors. Furthermore, chronic low-grade inflammation has been&#xD;
      proposed as a central contributor to sarcopenia and thus physical frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is not yet clear whether the elevated markers of inflammation seen in the elderly&#xD;
      are due to aging, chronic illness, or inactivity. But overall, it seems that inflammation&#xD;
      plays an important role in the development of muscle loss, and is related to increased risk&#xD;
      of falls, fragility, and early death.&#xD;
