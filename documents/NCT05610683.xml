  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End-stage renal disease (ESRD) induces an accumulation of uremic toxins responsible for&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality. These toxins cover a wide range of molecules, classified&#xD;
      according to their molecular weight as small-size (&lt; 500 Da), middle-size (500 Da-60 kDa),&#xD;
      and protein-bound toxins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific complications have been associated with the accumulation of middle-size toxins,&#xD;
      including beta2-microglobulin (12 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), prolactin (23 kDa),&#xD;
      alpha1-microglobulin (33 kDa), alpha1-glycoprotein (44 kDa), kappa (22 kDa) and lambda (45&#xD;
      kDa) free light chains (FLC). Moreover, mediators of oxidative stress such as asymmetric&#xD;
      dimethylarginine, malondialdehyde, oxidative-LDL and inflammatory cytokines such as&#xD;
      Interleukin-6 (IL)-6, IL1-β, TNF-α have been involved in atherosclerosis, malnutrition,&#xD;
      cardiovascular events and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodialysis (HD) remains the main standard modality of renal replacement therapy in ESRD. In&#xD;
      the past decade, low-flux hemodialysis was most commonly used, providing effective clearance&#xD;
      of small solutes through diffusion, but negligible clearance of middle molecules. This&#xD;
      limitation was insufficiently improved by the development of high-flux (HF) dialyzers due to&#xD;
      their cut-off pores size values of approximately 15-20 kDa. In fact, most of middle molecules&#xD;
      cannot be efficiently removed by HF-HD because of their molecular radii larger than that of&#xD;
      membrane pores. Thus, HF dialyzers were used in post dilution on-line hemodiafiltration&#xD;
      (OL-HDF) mode with high convection volumes and achieved greatest clearance of middle&#xD;
      molecules. However, OL-HDF is generally not available in most HD centers and needs additional&#xD;
      hardware technology. Therefore, several super high-flux (SHF) dialyzers integrating higher&#xD;
      cut-off size pore value and achieving Beta2-microglobulin clearance &gt; 70 ml/min were&#xD;
      developed for HD mode. These SHF dialyzers used in HD (SHF-HD) provides similar middle&#xD;
      molecules depuration compared to OL-HDF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recently developed medium cut-off (MCO) dialyzer (Theranova 500™, Baxter healthcare&#xD;
      Corporation Deerfield, USA; surface area 2 m², ultrafiltration coefficient: 59 ml/h/mmHg)&#xD;
      differs from conventional HF membranes by higher and controlled porosity resulting in a steep&#xD;
      sieving curve with a cut-off value approaching that of albumin. MCO-HD has demonstrated&#xD;
      efficient depuration of middle uremic toxins as compared to HF-HD, similar to that of OL-HDF.&#xD;
      MCO-HD and SHF-HD are two new large pore size dialyzers currently used nowadays in HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the interaction between blood and membrane surface play a key role in generating&#xD;
      oxidative stress and inflammation. Antioxidants such as vitamin E work by inhibiting LDL&#xD;
      oxidation and by limiting cellular response to oxidized LDL. In HD patients, vitamin E may be&#xD;
      integrated as a part of the HD procedure in the form of bioreactive dialysis membranes, in&#xD;
      which the blood surface has been modified with alpha-tocopherol. Dialysis with vitamin&#xD;
      E-coated membranes has been associated with an improvement in biocompatibility including&#xD;
      circulating lipid peroxidation biomarkers and cytokine induction. In small studies, vitamin E&#xD;
      coated dialyzers have been associated with reduced red blood count fragility and improvements&#xD;
      in erythropoietin resistance index and erythropoietin requirements in HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VieX (Polysulfone, surface area: 2.1 m², sterilization gamma, ultrafiltration coefficient:&#xD;
      104.3 ml/h/mmHg, Asahi Kasei Medical, Japan), a novel SHF vitamin E-coated (SHVE) dialyzer,&#xD;
      which has larger pore size than HF dialyzer, might provide higher middle molecules removal&#xD;
      and biocompatibility improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study was to compare the efficiency of the SHFVE dialyzer (VieX™)&#xD;
      versus the MCO dialyzer (Theranova 500™) on the removal of beta2-microglobulin and other&#xD;
      middle molecules in a non-inferiority fashion, and their respective effects on inflammation,&#xD;
      oxidative stress and biocompatibility parameters.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In a previous randomized study, it was found that compared to HF-HD after 3 months, MCO-HD&#xD;
      was associated with higher middle molecules removal and significant decrease in&#xD;
      beta2-microglobulin, oxidized low-density lipoprotein, kappa and lambda free light chain&#xD;
      pre-dialysis levels, without change in other inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers. In&#xD;
      addition, a modulation of inflammation has been demonstrated with MCO-HD in another&#xD;
      randomized trial. After 3 months, MCO-HD was shown to downregulate the expression of the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mRNA in peripheral leucocytes.&#xD;
      Moreover, higher removal and decrease in TNF alpha level with concurrent reduced resistance&#xD;
      to erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) has been also reported with MCO-HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VieX (Polysulfone, surface area: 2.1 m², sterilization gamma, ultrafiltration coefficient:&#xD;
      104.3 ml/h/mmHg, Asahi Kasei Medical, Japan), a novel SHF vitamin E-coated dialyzer, which&#xD;
      has larger pore size than HF dialyzer, might provide also higher middle molecules removal and&#xD;
      more biocompatibility improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data demonstrate similar reduction ration of beta2-microglobulin, which is the&#xD;
      most studied middle molecule, between MCO-HD and Super High Flux Vitamin E (SHFVE)-HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study was to compare the efficiency of the SHFVE dialyzer versus the&#xD;
      MCO dialyzer on the removal of beta2-microglobulin and other middle molecules in a&#xD;
      non-inferiority fashion, and their respective effects on inflammation, oxidative stress and&#xD;
      biocompatibility parameters.&#xD;
