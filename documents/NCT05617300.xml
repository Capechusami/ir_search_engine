    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Calculation of the participants who attend the first class of their session/the total number of participants who are enrolled. Enrolled is defined as a participant who is assigned to a course. Range [0-1]. A value closer to 1 is indicative of greater feasibility.</description>

    <measure>Completion Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Calculation of the participants who completed course/ participants who attend the first class of their session. Completion is defined as attending a minimum of 6 of the 9 classes. Range [0-1]. A value closer to 1 is indicative of greater feasibility.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Care Partner Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI-6). Total of 6 questions scored on a 5 point scale (0-4). The sum of the 6 questions in the total score. Range: 0-24. A higher score is indicative of greater caregiver burden. Change in control period compared to change in intervention period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Symptoms of Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10). Total of 10 questions scored on a categorical scale (0-3). The sum of the 10 questions is the total score. Range: 0-30. A total value above 10 is considered to be a sign of depression. A higher score represents a greater degree of depressed mood. Change in control period compared to change in intervention period.</description>

    <measure>Change in self-compassion</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using &quot;The State Self-Compassion Scale Short Form.&quot; Uses a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 5. [Range: 12-60] Higher scores indicates more self compassion.</description>

    <description>Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a standardized program that is both psychoeducation and skills-based, which uses mindfulness meditation practices to help people better cope with their emotions. This study uses a version of MBSR designed specifically for care partners of people living with dementia (PLWD) called Mindfulness Based Dementia Caregiving. Mindfulness Based Dementia Caregiving (MBDC) is a program with 8 weekly 2 hour sessions (plus one extended practice 4 hour retreat) including both formal and informal mindfulness practices, role play, and lectures combined with some dementia-specific education. Participants learn how to incorporate mindfulness practices into day-to-day life to help cope with the challenges and stresses of dementia care.</description>
