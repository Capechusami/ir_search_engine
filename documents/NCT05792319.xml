    <textblock>
      Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal-recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by&#xD;
      mutations in the ATP7B gene . It presents in childhood, adolescence or adulthood with a wide&#xD;
      range of clinical manifestations. The disease prevalence has previously been estimated as 1&#xD;
      in 30,000 , but some recent analyses have suggested a genetic prevalence of 1 in 7,000 .&#xD;
      Copper is absorbed from the stomach and duodenum, taken up by the liver, and secreted by the&#xD;
      liver into the systemic circulation bound to ceruloplasmin ATP7B transports copper through&#xD;
      the trans-Golgi network in hepatocytes before it is incorporated into apoceruloplasmin which&#xD;
      is secreted as holoceruloplasmin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATP7B is also essential for biliary excretion of copper when cytoplasmic levels are high.&#xD;
      Dysfunction of ATP7B therefore leads to accumulation of copper in the liver giving rise to&#xD;
      cellular damage and disease, and the release of nonceruloplasmin bound copper into the&#xD;
      systemic circulation. Copper also accumulates and is associated with cellular damage and&#xD;
      disease in other organs mostly in the brain Typical presentation of WD is in adolescence to&#xD;
      early adulthood, but it may occur at any age . Clinical presentation can vary widely in terms&#xD;
      of type and severity, but the key features are various degrees of liver disease,&#xD;

        The aim of this study to describe the clinical profile of children diagnosed as Wilson's&#xD;
        disease who were admitted to A.U.C.H and explore the out come of these patients either they&#xD;
        receive the chelation therapy or not along a period of one year&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All patients aged 1-18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of Wilson's disease according to Wilson's score&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. persistent neonatal jaundice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients presented with Acute and chronic liver disease rather than Wilson's e.g&#xD;

               2. Hepatitis C virus ,&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Hepatitis B virus infection ,(d)Hepatic focal lesions and(e) Metabolic liver&#xD;
                  disease e.g Gauchier ,glycogen storage disease and Niemman pick .&#xD;
