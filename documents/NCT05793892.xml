      Lattice laser is a new medical cosmetic technology, which is a kind of noninvasive and&#xD;
      invasive technology. Compared with traditional laser therapy, lattice laser has a wider range&#xD;
      of clinical use, and can be used to treat skin problems such as acne marks, fine wrinkles,&#xD;
      skin aging, chloasma, coffee spots, large pores and dullness. Dot-array laser has been widely&#xD;
      used in the treatment of skin diseases and skin cosmetics because of its advantages of small&#xD;
      trauma, rapid recovery, safety and effectiveness, and fewer complications. The facial skin is&#xD;
      rich in nerve fibers and pain receptors are distributed punctuately. Most patients have pain&#xD;
      and discomfort to varying degrees during laser treatment. The pain and discomfort associated&#xD;
      with laser treatment of the face make anaesthesia an important assistant technique in laser&#xD;
      skin cosmetology. At present, the commonly used anesthesia methods to relieve pain include:&#xD;
      local cooling anesthesia, topical anesthesia, general anesthesia, gas inhalation anesthesia,&#xD;
      intravenous anesthesia, iontophoresis anesthesia, etc. General anesthesia is usually&#xD;
      associated with a risk of complications, residual areas of regional nerve block are often&#xD;
      sensitive to pain, and acupuncture and drug injection can increase patient discomfort.&#xD;
      Therefore, because of its simplicity and convenience of drug administration, topical&#xD;
      anesthesia has a positive significance in facial lattice laser cosmetic treatment. The&#xD;
      reference product lidocaine tetracaine cream (brand name: Pliaglis ®) has been marketed in&#xD;
      the United States and the European Union for many years, and its therapeutic efficacy has&#xD;
      been clinically recognized and has a good safety profile.Lidocaine tetracaine cream (R &amp; D&#xD;
      code: CU-30101) is manufactured by Cutia Therapeutics (Wuxi) Co., Ltd . A randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, multi-center clinical study is currently proposed to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of CU-30101 in facial spot-array laser cosmetology in Chinese subjects with Pliaglis ®&#xD;
      as a control.&#xD;

      On the one hand, MTZ can self-repair, stimulate collagen regeneration and improve skin&#xD;
      texture; on the other hand, due to the small area of MTZ injury, the surrounding normal skin&#xD;
      tissue can be rapidly repaired, reduce the risk of treatment and shorten the recovery time.&#xD;

      Drug Registration Category and Application Dossier Requirements (NMPA 2020 No. 44), lidocaine&#xD;
      tetracaine cream (R &amp; D code: CU-30101) manufactured by Corde Biopharmaceuticals (Wuxi) Co.,&#xD;
      Ltd. is registered as a chemical class 3. A randomized, double-blind, multi-center clinical&#xD;
      study is currently proposed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CU-30101 in facial&#xD;
      spot-array laser cosmetology in Chinese subjects with Pliaglis ® as a control.&#xD;
