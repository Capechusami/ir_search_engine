  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with dementia and their families are especially vulnerable during a disaster as&#xD;
      it limits caregivers' ability to continue with care due to disaster related stress and&#xD;
      reduced access to resources and support. The COVID-19 pandemic showed the extreme&#xD;
      vulnerability of persons with dementia (PWD) and their caregivers as they struggled to access&#xD;
      support and resources due to the threat of COVID-19 infection; such impact was exacerbated in&#xD;
      rural areas where caregivers are geographically isolated and disaster management resources&#xD;
      are scarce. With the number of federally declared disasters increasing dramatically over the&#xD;
      past 50 years, active public health efforts are needed to support caregivers in developing&#xD;
      emergency caregiving plans usable in disasters such as pandemics and extreme weather&#xD;
      emergencies. The long-term goal of this project is to enhance emergency preparedness and&#xD;
      support networks of caregivers of PWD to increase their resilience and minimize distress by&#xD;
      implementing an intervention program, Disaster PrepWise (DPW). In the DPW program, a trained&#xD;
      Medical Reserve Corp (MRC) volunteer will provide step-by-step guidance to caregivers to&#xD;
      jointly develop emergency preparedness plans and personal support networks. The objectives of&#xD;
      this proposed study are to 1) test the impact of DPW on caregiver outcomes (i.e., resilience,&#xD;
      stress) and perceptions that may mediate the association between DPW and outcomes (caregiver&#xD;
      self-efficacy, preparedness, social support); and 2) evaluate implementation strategies in a&#xD;
      real-world setting to optimize future dissemination. We will conduct a randomized control&#xD;
      trial of 200 caregivers of persons with dementia involving two arms: DPW intervention group&#xD;
      and an information-only control group (print information on disaster preparedness).&#xD;
      Assessments will occur before randomization (baseline), and 3 and 6 months after the&#xD;
      baseline. This study is innovative in its use of a highly personalized disaster preparedness&#xD;
      program with built-in assistance to support caregivers; the support will be provided through&#xD;
      an existing national-level public health infrastructure (MRC) that has a great potential to&#xD;
      reach older adults and caregivers in rural areas. The knowledge and data obtained through&#xD;
      this study will lay the foundation for a future larger-scale multi-state pragmatic trial to&#xD;
      assess dissemination potentials.&#xD;

    <description>The Disaster PrepWise (DPW) intervention consists of five interactive modules and two supplemental sections (special topics and resources on various types of disasters). The five modules are: (1) Complete a Personal &amp; Household Assessment, (2) Develop a Personal Emergency Network, (3) Develop Emergency Information &amp; Gather Important Documents, (4) Keep a 3-5 Day Supply of Medications &amp; Medical Supplies, and (5) Build an Emergency Supply Kit. Through an initial visit (IV1) and a follow-up phone conversation 4 weeks later (IV2), the interventionist will develop a personalized disaster management plan and provide it to the participant for sharing with family and friends. Eight weeks after the initial session, the interventionist will make a final follow-up call (IV3) to provide any additional assistance caregivers may need.</description>
