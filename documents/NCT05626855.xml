    <description>Apitegromab (SRK-015) is an investigational, fully human immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to human proforms (i.e., inactive precursor forms) of myostatin, pro- and latent- myostatin, with high affinity, inhibiting activation of myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle growth and strength.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients have completed the Phase 2 TOPAZ (Study SRK-015-002) trial or the Phase 3&#xD;
             SAPPHIRE (Study SRK-015-003) trial. (For TOPAZ, completed is defined as completion of&#xD;
             Visit EC14 in Extension Period C or participating in TOPAZ at the time the trial is&#xD;
             ended. For SAPPHIRE, completed is defined as completion of Visit 14 or participating&#xD;
             in SAPPHIRE at the time the trial is ended)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated life expectancy &gt;2 years from Baseline (Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to receive study drug infusions and provide blood samples through the use of a&#xD;
             peripheral IV or a long-term IV access device that the patient has placed for reasons&#xD;
             independent from the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to adhere to the requirements of the protocol, including travel to the trial site&#xD;
             and completing all trial procedures and trial visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Baseline and&#xD;
             agree to use at least 1 acceptable method of contraception throughout the trial and&#xD;
             for 20 weeks after the last dose of apitegromab&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient permanently discontinued study treatment during the feeder trial (i.e., TOPAZ&#xD;
             or SAPPHIRE)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nutritional status that was not stable over the past 6 months and is not anticipated&#xD;
             to be stable throughout the trial or medical necessity for a gastric/nasogastric&#xD;
             feeding tube, where the majority of feeds are given by this route, as assessed by the&#xD;
             Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is currently enrolled in any investigational drug trial other than TOPAZ or&#xD;
             SAPPHIRE&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of severe hypersensitivity reaction or intolerance to SMN-targeted&#xD;
             therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of severe hypersensitivity reaction or intolerance to apitegromab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of chronic daytime noninvasive ventilatory support for &gt;16 hours daily in the 2&#xD;
             weeks before dosing, or anticipated to regularly receive such daytime ventilator&#xD;
             support chronically throughout the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any acute or comorbid condition interfering with the well-being of the patient at the&#xD;
             patient's last visit in TOPAZ or SAPPHIRE, (including active systemic infection, the&#xD;
             need for acute treatment, or inpatient observation due to any reason). After&#xD;
             resolution of the condition, the patient can be enrolled in the trial if they meet all&#xD;
             the other eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition or clinically significant laboratory result or ECG value that, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the Investigator, may compromise safety or compliance, would preclude&#xD;
             the patient from successful completion of the trial, or interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of the results&#xD;
