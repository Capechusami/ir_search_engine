      Primary Study Objective : To compare the effects of low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin versus&#xD;
      aspirin on atherosclerotic plaque inflammation using serial FDG Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography/Computed Tomography(PET-CT) imaging of carotid artery and ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Study Objective : To compare the effects of low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin&#xD;
      versus aspirin on biomarkers including high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein(CRP) and lipid&#xD;
      profiles.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is a major health problem across the world. The age-adjusted death&#xD;
      rate for cardiovascular disease has significantly decreased during recent decades, and this&#xD;
      decline is related to the widespread use of evidence-based medicines. However, even upon&#xD;
      optimal medical therapies, patients remains at a substantial residual risk for acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome (ACS) or acute ischemic stroke(AIS), requiring new therapeutic approaches. Plaque&#xD;
      rupture and subsequent thrombus formation is the most common cause of ACS and AIS.&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis is a chronic immune-inflammatory disorder. Inflammation is believed to be&#xD;
      critically important to plaque rupture by destroying the fibrous cap, thereby predisposing to&#xD;
      ACS and AIS. Cross-talk between coagulation and inflammatory pathway via protease-activated&#xD;
      receptor (PAR) activation has been recognized . Factor Xa is responsible for promoting&#xD;
      inflammation, which participate in the atherosclerotic process and plaque destabilization&#xD;
      either directly via activation of PARs or indirectly through the generation of thrombin .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies (COMPASS) trial,&#xD;
      the rate of a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction was lower&#xD;
      by 24% with low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus aspirin than with aspirin alone&#xD;
      among patients with stable atherosclerotic vascular disease, but the rate of major bleeding&#xD;
      was higher by 70%. Interestingly, the rate of stroke was remarkably lower by 42% with&#xD;
      rivaroxaban plus aspirin than with aspirin alone. The substantial net clinical benefits seen&#xD;
      with rivaroxaban plus aspirin may not be fully explained by their anti-thrombotic effect&#xD;
      alone, suggesting pleiotropic effects coupled with factor Xa antagonism. Besides its role in&#xD;
      hemostasis and thrombosis, low-dose rivaroxaban may inhibit atherosclerotic plaque&#xD;
      inflammation and decrease plaque destabilization. To test this hypothesis, the investigators&#xD;
      will compare the effects of aspirin versus aspirin plus low-dose rivaroxaban on carotid&#xD;
      atherosclerotic plaque inflammation using serial 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron&#xD;
      Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography(PET-CT) imaging of carotid artery and ascending&#xD;
      aorta.&#xD;
