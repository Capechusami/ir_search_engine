  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess long term performance and safety of AONDA in a real&#xD;
      world setting when worn as daily wear or continuous wear for vision correction. This study&#xD;
      will be used to support AONDA's marketability in Europe and other locations.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this retrospective observational study, the subject used AONDA for at least approximately&#xD;
      1 year in either a daily wear (DW) or continuous wear (CW) modality with monthly replacement.&#xD;
      For the CW cohort only, 3-year data will be collected, if available.&#xD;

    <measure>Distance visual acuity at Year 1 - DW Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 1</time_frame>
    <description>The subject's chart will be reviewed for a distance visual acuity assessment at 1 year after the baseline exam. The 1-year visit will be defined as a visit which occurred 1 year (-2/+4 months) since baseline, during which period the subject was wearing AONDA, and a contact lens examination was performed. Baseline will be defined as the first office visit where the investigator provided an in-person office biomicroscopy exam to the patient, before or during which a contact lens prescription for AONDA was released.</description>

    <time_frame>Year 3</time_frame>
    <description>The subject's chart will be reviewed for a distance visual acuity assessment at 3 years after the baseline exam. The 3-year visit will be defined as a visit which occurred 3 years (-2/+8 months) since baseline, during which period the subject was wearing AONDA and a contact lens examination was performed. The 3-year visit will be applicable only if the chart indicates the subject was wearing AONDA since baseline and 1-year.</description>
