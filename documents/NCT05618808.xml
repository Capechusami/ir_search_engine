  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of REGN9933 for the prevention&#xD;
      of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA), compared to&#xD;
      enoxaparin&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the bleeding risk (ie, major and clinically relevant non-major [CRNM]&#xD;
           bleeding) of REGN9933 after unilateral TKA through time of venography, compared to&#xD;
           enoxaparin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess overall safety and tolerability of REGN9933 in participants undergoing TKA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of REGN9933 in prevention of clinically relevant VTE, compared&#xD;
           to enoxaparin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of REGN9933 in prevention of deep venous thrombosis (DVT)&#xD;
           detected by venography, compared to enoxaparin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of REGN9933 after single intravenous (IV)&#xD;
           administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of REGN9933 on intrinsic and extrinsic&#xD;
           coagulation pathways&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess immunogenicity following a single dose of REGN9933 over time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy of enoxaparin and apixaban in prevention of VTE after unilateral&#xD;
           TKA&#xD;
