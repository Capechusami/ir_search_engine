  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will establish whether prolonged chronic dosing with secukinumab is needed in&#xD;
      participants with Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, (nr-axSpA) who have achieved&#xD;
      remission. Remission is defined as Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score - C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (ASDAS-CRP) Inactive Disease (ID) response (ASDAS-CRP &lt; 1.3). Maintenance of&#xD;
      remission on continued secukinumab treatment will be evaluated compared to placebo using a&#xD;
      randomized withdrawal design. The primary outcome measure for this study is the proportion of&#xD;
      participants remaining flare-free at Week 120.&#xD;

      Spondylitis Disease Activity Score - C-reactive protein (ASDAS-CRP) Inactive Disease (ID)&#xD;
      response Inactive Disease (ID) response (ASDAS-CRP &lt; 1.3). The maintenance of remission on&#xD;
      continued secukinumab treatment will be evaluated compared to placebo using a randomized&#xD;
      withdrawal design. The primary outcome measure for this study is the proportion of&#xD;
      participants remaining flare-free at Week 120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open-label Secukinumab PFS (prefilled syringe) will be labeled as AIN457 150mg/1mL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Double-blind Secukinumab and Placebo PFS will be labeled as AIN457 150mg/1mL/Placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration will be up to 128 weeks from Baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment duration will be up to 120 weeks with last treatment administration at Week&#xD;
      116.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Treatment Period 1 participant will attend a site visit approximately 1 month after&#xD;
      Baseline and approximately every 12 weeks thereafter. In the Treatment Period 2 participant&#xD;
      will attend site visits approximately every 4 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of participants in the randomized withdrawal population remaining flare-free at Week 120. A flare is defined as ASDAS-CRP ≥ 2.1 at 2 consecutive visits, or ASDAS-CRP &gt; 3.5 at any visit during Treatment Period 2, starting at Week 60.&#xD;
Parameters used for ASDAS-CRP include:&#xD;
