    <textblock>
      The current study seeks to pilot test the iENDURE (Enhancing Distress tolerance to Uplift&#xD;
      motivation in Recovery) intervention among 10 participants with Long COVID (Coronavirus&#xD;
      Disease) symptoms. Following informed consent procedures, participants will complete a brief&#xD;
      baseline assessment of self-report measures. Participants will then engage in the iENDURE&#xD;
      intervention (described below) for 4 weeks. At the end of the intervention period,&#xD;
      participants will complete another brief assessment of self-report measures and a qualitative&#xD;
      interview about their experience with the program. Participants will be compensated for&#xD;
      completing the baseline and post-intervention assessments&#xD;

    <measure>Client Satisfaction Score (CSQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measure satisfaction scores after 4 weeks of using the intervention for this group of participants with Long COVID as measured by the client satisfaction questionnaire. Total scores range from 8 to 32, with the higher number indicating greater satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>System Usability Score (SUS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measure usability after 4 weeks for this group of participants with Long COVID as measured by the 10 item system usability scale. In the SUS instrument, even and odd questions are scored differently. Odd questions are scored 0-4 based on the 1-5 selection, where a selection of 1 equals 0 points, a selection of 2 equals 1 point, and so on. Even questions are scored 4-0 on the 1-5 selection where a selection of 1 equals 4 points, a selection of 2 equals 3 points, and so on. Scores for all ten questions are added up for a total score between 0-40 points. This total is multiplied by 2.5 to generate a SUS score between 0-100 points. Based on research, a SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average.</description>

    <description>Two delivery modes: computer and text message. The intervention provides introductory strategies for managing physical and emotional distress associated with Long COVID through a computer-delivered session followed by 4-weeks of theoretically-informed text messages intended to promote distress tolerance (DT).&#xD;
Computer - the initial intervention will be delivered online via the Qualtrics survey tool following informed consent. The intervention provides strategies to better tolerate emotional and physical discomfort to persist with behavioral goals. Text Message - The text message intervention will be delivered using Marigold Health (a HIPAA compliant platform for secure text messaging). Participants will receive daily text messages that focus on emphasizing adaptive strategies for tolerating physical and emotional discomfort in order to work toward behavioral goals. The text messages will be personalized and offer skills training (reminders of previously learned DT skills).</description>
