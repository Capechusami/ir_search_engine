  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational study is to assess the risk of viral infections in patients&#xD;
      receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a haploidentical donor compared&#xD;
      to those who receive HSCT from a HLA-matched donor. The main question it aims to answer is:&#xD;
      to describe which viruses are replicating in the blood of the above two patient groups on the&#xD;
      day of transplantation and at 1, 3 and 6 months after transplantation. Blood samples taken as&#xD;
      part of routine care on the day of transplantation and at 1, 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      post-transplantation visits are analyzed and the types and amount of viruses detected in the&#xD;
      two groups of patients are described.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Geneva University Hospitals are one of the three centers performing allogeneic HSCT in&#xD;
      Switzerland. Since several years the Division of infectious diseases runs a collaborative&#xD;
      research program with the Division of Hematology. In 2015 the two divisions jointly created a&#xD;
      prospective cohort of allo-HSCT patients called: &quot;Infectious diseases in hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell transplant patients cohort&quot; enrolling potentially all adult patients engrafted in our&#xD;
      center since 2015 (CCER protocol 15-120 and relative amendments). The cohort compiles&#xD;
      clinical data on hematological and infectious complications occurring up to one year after&#xD;
      transplantation and biological specimen collected systematically until up to 2 years after&#xD;
      transplantation, which are stored in a joint biobank.&#xD;
