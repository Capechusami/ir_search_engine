  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational study is to test in patients with resectable rectosigmoid&#xD;
      cancers. The main question it aims to answer is establishment of a feasibility model for&#xD;
      predicting natural orifice specimen extraction surgery (NOSES) based on machine learning.&#xD;

    <description>The training set is a dataset used to train the model, which includes randomly enrolled patients with colon and rectal cancer. The inputs include data such as gender, age, height, weight, BMI, tumor stage, tumor pathology type, and the output information is whether NOSES surgery was successful or not. During training, the model learns from this dataset to make predictions on whether new patients with colon and rectal cancer can undergo NOSES surgery successfully.</description>

    <description>The test set is a dataset used to evaluate the performance of a trained machine learning model. It includes another randomly enrolled group of patients with colon and rectal cancer, as well as their clinical and pathological data and surgical outcomes. The outputs are not used during training, but are used to test the trained model to evaluate its predictive ability on unknown data. The purpose is to evaluate the model's generalization ability, that is, its performance on new and unknown data.</description>

    <description>Natural Orifice Specimen Extraction Surgery (NOSES) is a minimally invasive surgical technique that aims to reduce the size and number of incisions required during certain surgeries. In NOSES, the surgical specimen (such as a diseased organ or tumor) is removed from the body through a natural orifice (such as the mouth, anus, or vagina), rather than through an incision in the abdominal wall. In this trial, we will extract surgical specimens from the rectum to reduce trauma to the abdominal wall.</description>
