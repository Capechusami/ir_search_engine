  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer affects mostly older adults. The development of Geriatric Oncology has greatly&#xD;
      improved the management of older patients with the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessments (CGA)&#xD;
      being conducted before cancer treatment. A CGA encompasses several dimensions such as&#xD;
      comorbidities, but also functional, nutritional or cognitive domains. The International&#xD;
      guidelines recommended establishing cooperation with pharmacists as part of the CGA in order&#xD;
      to review prescriptions of older patients with cancer and to avoid adverse side effects of&#xD;
      treatment. However, the CGA before starting oncological treatment offer is limited in France,&#xD;
      especially in some regions which are less populated, or where access to medical centers are&#xD;
      difficult. The main objective of our work is to evaluate the impact of telemedicine in&#xD;
      geriatric oncology consultation of unexplained re-hospitalization rate at 3 months in the&#xD;
      acute care unit. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the impact of telemedicine on&#xD;
      unexplained re-hospitalization rate at 6 months, on the secondary toxicities, on the&#xD;
      postoperative complications in patients treated surgically, on the overall survival and on&#xD;
      the acceptance of the pharmaceutical recommendations by the physicians, but also the impact&#xD;
      of telemedicine in medico-economic terms and the satisfaction of patients and oncologists&#xD;
      benefiting from teleconsultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a multicenter, prospective, randomized study involving 500 patients in 9 participating&#xD;
      centers, including 6 peripheral hospitals. The experiment will be represented by the&#xD;
      implementation of telemedicine in oncology centers where this expertise is not very&#xD;
      available, allowing them to benefit from geriatric oncology teleconsultation and&#xD;
      pharmaceutical tele-expertise carried out by three university hospitals. Patients recruited&#xD;
      by oncologists, according to the inclusion criteria, will give their written consent to&#xD;
      participate. Centers were randomized. In the control arm, patients will be treated according&#xD;
      to the usual oncological management as defined for each type of cancer. In the interventional&#xD;
      arm, patients will benefit from a CGA with a geriatric oncology teleconsultation as well as a&#xD;
      pharmaceutical tele-expertise before the initiation of oncological treatment.&#xD;

      Cancer affects nearly 50% of people over 65 years. The development of Geriatric Oncology has&#xD;
      greatly improved the management of older patients with the Comprehensive Geriatric&#xD;
      Assessments (CGA) being conducted before cancer treatment. A CGA encompasses several&#xD;
      dimensions such as comorbidities, functional, nutritional or cognitive domains. This practice&#xD;
      aims to guarantee adapted oncological treatment to their frailties through a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary and multi-professional approach. The International guidelines recommended&#xD;
      establishing cooperation with pharmacists as part of the CGA in order to review prescriptions&#xD;
      of older patients with cancer and avoid adverse side effects of treatment. However, the CGA&#xD;
      before starting oncological treatment offer is limited in France, especially in some regions&#xD;
      which are less populated, or where access to medical centers are difficult for older&#xD;
      patients. Telemedicine is developing in France and is particularly intended for rural&#xD;
      populations in order to facilitate access to specialized consultations. The ongoing COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic episode has clearly enabled to develop telemedicine in hospitals. The main objective&#xD;
      of our work is to evaluate the impact of telemedicine in geriatric oncology consultation on&#xD;
      the unexplained re-hospitalization rate at 3 months in the acute care unit. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to evaluate the impact of telemedicine on the unexplained re-hospitalization&#xD;
      rate at 6 months, on the secondary toxicities of oncological treatments, on the postoperative&#xD;
      complications in patients treated surgically, on the overall survival and on the acceptance&#xD;
      of the pharmaceutical recommendations by the physicians, but also on medico-economic terms&#xD;
      and on satisfaction of patients and oncologists benefiting from teleconsultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a multicenter, prospective, randomized study involving 500 patients in 9 participating&#xD;
      centers, including 6 peripheral hospitals. The experiment will be represented by the&#xD;
      implementation of telemedicine in oncology centers where this expertise is not very&#xD;
      available, allowing them to benefit from geriatric oncology teleconsultation and&#xD;
      pharmaceutical tele-expertise carried out by three university hospitals. Patients recruited&#xD;
      by oncologists, according to the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria, will give their&#xD;
      written consent to participate. Centers will be randomized into two arms. In the control arm,&#xD;
      patients will be treated according to the usual oncological management as defined for each&#xD;
      type of cancer. In the interventional arm, patients will benefit from a CGA with a geriatric&#xD;
      oncology teleconsultation as well as a pharmaceutical tele-expertise before the initiation of&#xD;
      oncological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology and analysis plan will be based on the criteria developed by the Consolidated&#xD;
      Standards of Reporting Trials Statement (CONSORT) group and more specifically on the&#xD;
      extension concerning cluster studies. The expected benefits are a reduction of unexplained&#xD;
      re-hospitalizations rate and of inequalities concerning access to care for older patients.&#xD;
