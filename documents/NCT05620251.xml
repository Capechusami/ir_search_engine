  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with type 1 diabetes may be at increased risk for severe coronavirus disease-2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19) and are therefore prioritized for access to severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination. The pivotal trial that assessed the efficacy of the&#xD;
      BNT162b2 vaccine among adolescents demonstrated 100% protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
      after a two-dose regimen. However, the research did not include adolescents with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes. In this study, the investigators aimed to assess the humoral immune response of&#xD;
      infection-naive adolescents with type 1 diabetes following vaccination with the BNT162b2&#xD;
      vaccine in comparison to that of infection-naive healthy controls and the factors associated&#xD;
      with that response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Having either form of diabetes as a comorbidity has been implicated as a risk factor for&#xD;
      severe COVID-19. Therefore, vaccination against COVID-19 has been highly recommended for&#xD;
      people with diabetes. However, since diabetes is associated with persistent and profound&#xD;
      impairments in both innate and acquired immunity, whether the immune system of people with&#xD;
      diabetes will be able to mount an adequate antibody (ab) response following COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccination has remained in question. Some studies have reported that adults with diabetes&#xD;
      develop an inadequate immune response to hepatitis B vaccines, whereas less consistent&#xD;
      results have been reported for varicella-zoster and influenza vaccines. Likewise, certain&#xD;
      pediatric studies have found that serum ab titers against hepatitis B surface antigen and&#xD;
      pneumococcal antigens were lower in children with type 1 diabetes than in controls following&#xD;
      hepatitis B vaccine and unconjugated pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine administration. In&#xD;
      this context, concerns about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in people with diabetes&#xD;
      have led to the investigation of their immunogenicity after vaccination against COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus far, few studies have explored the ab response of people with diabetes following&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccination. In the majority of studies conducted, the seroconversion rates of&#xD;
      people with diabetes were found to be lower than those of age-matched healthy controls.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, the majority of the diabetic people included in these studies were still able to&#xD;
      elicit a strong ab response. However, most of these studies only enrolled adults with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes. The ab response to COVID-19 vaccination in a pediatric cohort with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      has not been investigated. Thus, in this single-centered prospective observational study, the&#xD;
      investigators aimed to analyze the ab response to a widely used and effective mRNA (messenger&#xD;
      ribonucleic acid)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BNT162b2, in adolescents with type 1 diabetes&#xD;
      compared to that of healthy controls and the factors associated with that response.&#xD;
