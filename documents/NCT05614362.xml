    <textblock>
      This study is a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with ESRD on&#xD;
      HD or CAPD based RRTs at Moewardi General Hospital in Surakarta, Indonesia from January to&#xD;
      March 2021. Subjects were randomized to either a Channa striata or a placebo group and were&#xD;
      given a three times daily dosage of 500 mg of Channa striatus extract or 500 mg maltodextrin,&#xD;
      respectively for 21 days. Serum albumin and hs-CRP were measured at the baseline, and at the&#xD;
      end of the study&#xD;

      Study design This research was a randomized, double blinded, 2-arm parallel comparative study&#xD;
      of CS extract vs placebo. This was conducted at the Department of Kidney and Hypertension,&#xD;
      Moewardi General Hospital Surakarta from January 2021 - March 2021. The researcher has&#xD;
      obtained an ethical clearance from the local ethics commission for basic/clinical research at&#xD;
      Moewardi General Hospital, Surakarta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection The population in this study were ESRD patients aged between 18 and 60&#xD;
      years old who underwent HD and CAPD at Moewardi General Hospital, Surakarta and agreed to&#xD;
      being included in this study. Patients with history of malignancies, autoimmune disease, and&#xD;
      active infection all were excluded. Patients who had taken any form albumin, herbal&#xD;
      supplementation, antioxidant, steroid, immunosuppressive or heparin medication were also&#xD;
      excluded. Sample selection was done by consecutive sampling to all eligible ESRD patients.&#xD;
      The samples in this study would be divided into 2 groups; treatment group and control group,&#xD;
      each had the same proportion of HD and CAPD patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding The participants were randomized into 2 equal size groups which&#xD;
      were the CS and placebo group. Participants were numbered sequentially following time of&#xD;
      participation, and the type of RRT received. This separation of numbering according to RRT&#xD;
      was performed to ensure an equal proportion of RRT received in both groups. A randomization&#xD;
      list was generated using Random Allocation Software and subject numbers were allocated with&#xD;
      1:1 ratio, separately according to the type of RRT received. Blinding of participants and&#xD;
      attending physicians were achieved by using identical capsules of placebo and CS extract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention The CS extract was obtained from ONOIWAÂ® capsules (PT. Natura Nuswantara&#xD;
      Nirmala, Tangerang, Indonesia) and purchased from a retail drug store. Each capsule contained&#xD;
      pure 500 mg CS extract powder. The placebo used was 500 mg maltodextrin powder encapsulated&#xD;
      in the same capsule color of the CS extract capsule. The placebo was prepared in Pharmacy&#xD;
      Department of Moewardi General Hospital, and pre-purchased from a commercial drug store. Both&#xD;
      of the groups consumed the extract of the placebo, with a dose of three times a day for 21&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visit and endpoint The venous blood samples for hs-CRP and albumin were collected&#xD;
      before the administration of intervention, and at day 21. All of the tubes were then sent to&#xD;
      the Department of Clinical Pathology at Moewardi General Hospital for the blood analysis to&#xD;
      be performed. All social demographic feature of the patients were collected at baseline,&#xD;
      including gender, age, type and length of RRT treatment. All of the patients were then&#xD;
      monitored at each weekly visit to examine their clinical status and will be drop-outed when&#xD;
      clinical deterioration occurred.&#xD;
