      In this case control study,we will analyzed Patients admitted to Neurology Depatment in&#xD;
      assuit university hospitals from 1/2023 until 1/2024 and divide them in two groups , Group&#xD;
      receive early rehabilitation services with the personnel get tele-rehab training and the&#xD;
      other group get training with the usual pathway in the hospital by other personnel, and we&#xD;
      could follow up the two groups for 3 months and comparing both groups .&#xD;
