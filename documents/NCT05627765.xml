  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a three-arm randomized controlled trial in a convenience sample of 150&#xD;
      smokers aged 18-25 years with a drinking habit who will be recruited from smoking hotspots in&#xD;
      Mong Kok. Participants will be randomized into a standard treatment (ST), II, or control arm.&#xD;
      Participants in the ST arm will receive a brief smoking cessation intervention based on the&#xD;
      Asking about tobacco use, Advising smokers to quit, Assessing their willingness to quit,&#xD;
      Assisting in quitting, and Arranging for follow-up and Relevance, Risks, Rewards, Roadblocks&#xD;
      and Repetition models. Participants in the II arm will receive brief advice on alcohol use&#xD;
      based on the FRAMES model in addition to the brief smoking cessation intervention. Booster&#xD;
      interventions will be provided to both ST and II arms at 1-week, 1-month, 3-month, and&#xD;
      6-month follow-up. Participants in the control arm will receive leaflets on smoking cessation&#xD;
      and alcohol abstinence. Data collection will be done at baseline and at 1-week, 1-month,&#xD;
      3-month, and 6-month follow-ups. Self-reported quitters at 6-month follow-up will be invited&#xD;
      for biochemical validation.&#xD;
