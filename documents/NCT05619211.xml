  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the potential effects of a high-intensity home-exercise program&#xD;
      among children with cerebral palsy. The program includes rhythmic movements to music that are&#xD;
      adapted for wheelchair uses and age-appropriate themes. This project has the potential to&#xD;
      address a large knowledge gap in the extant literature, because there are no widely&#xD;
      accessible, evidence-based, enjoyable, and age-appropriate modalities for improving&#xD;
      cardiovascular fitness or cardiometabolic health among children with disabilities who have&#xD;
      mobility disabilities.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  have a medical diagnosis of cerebral palsy, as determined by ICD-10 codes&#xD;
&#xD;

             participant screening, explained in the protocol section below)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  medical clearance to participate in high-intensity exercise from a physician (using&#xD;

             swollen lymph glands.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pregnant (due to radiation from a Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry [DEXA] scan)&#xD;
&#xD;
