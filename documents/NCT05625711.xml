  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was a prospective, multicenter, single-group design. To undergo endovascular&#xD;
      treatment of lower extremity arteriosclerosis obliterans After the subjects were selected and&#xD;
      enrolled, the surgeons used the endovascular interventional surgical instrument control&#xD;
      system developed by Shanghai Aopeng Medical Technology Co., Ltd. and the consumables of the&#xD;
      endovascular interventional surgical instrument control system for the interventional hand&#xD;
      Instrumentation (guide wire, catheter, stent, balloon) for remote delivery, manipulation, and&#xD;
      withdrawal&#xD;
