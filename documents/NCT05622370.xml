      An open label, balanced, randomized, 3×3 latin square design comparing of Brivaracetam&#xD;
      sustained-release tablets and Brivaracetam tablets in the oral comparative&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic(PK) study in Chinese healthy adult subjects under fasting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test preparation A(T1): Brivaracetam sustained-release tablets (100mg/ tablet, developed by&#xD;
      Taizhou Overseas Pharmaceuticals Co.,Ltd.) Test preparation B(T2): Brivaracetam&#xD;
      sustained-release tablets (50mg/ tablet, developed by Taizhou Overseas Pharmaceuticals&#xD;
      Co.,Ltd.) Reference preparation (R): Brivaracetam tablets (50mg/ tablet, BRIVIACT®, UCB)&#xD;
      Objective: The sustained-release tablets of Brivaracetam (specification: 100mg) developed by&#xD;
      Taizhou Overseas Pharmaceuticals Co.,Ltd. were used as the test preparation A(T1), the&#xD;
      sustained-release tablets of Brivaracetam (specification: 50mg) were used as the test&#xD;
      preparation B(T2), and the Brivaracetam tablets (trade name: BRIVIACT®, specification: 50mg)&#xD;
      produced by UCB were used as the reference preparation (R). To compare the blood&#xD;
      concentration and main pharmacokinetic parameters between test preparation A(T1) and test&#xD;
      preparation B(T2), between test preparation A(T1) and reference preparation, and between test&#xD;
      preparation B(T2) and reference preparation, and evaluate the relative bioavailability and&#xD;
      sustained release characteristics of test preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the safety of China healthy volunteers after oral administration of&#xD;
      sustained-release tablets of test preparation A(T1) and B(T2) and reference preparation (R)&#xD;
      Brivaracetam tablets on an empty stomach.&#xD;

      Single-center, randomized, open, 3×3 Latin square design, and administration on an empty&#xD;
      stomach. All subjects must sign an informed consent form before taking part in the trial. 12&#xD;
      healthy subjects (half male and half female) who passed the screening were randomly divided&#xD;
      into three groups: T1-T2-R group, T2-R-T1 group and R-T1-T2 group, with 4 people in each&#xD;
      group. The selected subjects entered the first ward of the clinical research center one day&#xD;
      before taking medicine in each cycle, and fasted for more than 10 hours before taking&#xD;
      medicine in each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the morning of taking medicine in each cycle, after the collection of blank blood samples,&#xD;
      the corresponding study drugs were taken according to the random table, and 240mL of warm&#xD;
      water was taken. Eat standard lunch after 4h of the first administration, eat standard dinner&#xD;
      after 10h, and drink water before and within 1h after the first administration (except 240mL&#xD;
      of water used for administration). During the experiment, a unified diet is required. The&#xD;
      test method is the same for each cycle, and the cleaning period for each cycle is 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK blood collection and blood sample treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For test preparation A(T1) and test preparation B(T2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before administration (0h) and&#xD;
      5min、10min、20min、40min、1h、1.25h、1.5h、1.75h、2h、2.5h、3h、3.5h、4h、4.5h、5h、5.5h、6h、7h、8h、10h、12h、1&#xD;
      6h、24h、36h、48h,Blood samples were collected at 26 time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the reference preparation (R):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before (0h) and after&#xD;
      5min、10min、20min、40min、1h、1.25h、1.5h、1.75h、2h、2.25h、2.5h、3h、4h、6h、8h、10h、12h、12.25h、12.5h、12.&#xD;
      75h、13h、13.25h、13.5h、13.75h、14h、14.5h、15h、16h、18h、24h、36h、48h，Blood samples were collected at&#xD;
      33 time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sitting vital signs (including body temperature, pulse and blood pressure) of the&#xD;
      subjects were measured within 1 hour before the first administration and 2.0h±0.5h,&#xD;
      4.0h±0.5h, 24±1.0h and 48±1.0h after administration. In the third cycle, the subjects were&#xD;
      examined for safety before leaving the hospital, including physical examination, vital signs&#xD;
      examination, electrocardiogram and laboratory related examination. During the study, pay&#xD;
      attention to observe and ask the subjects' subjective feelings and possible adverse events&#xD;
      during the experiment. All the subjects were followed up by telephone or WeChat 7~10 days&#xD;
      after the end of the third cycle, and asked if there were any follow-up adverse events. In&#xD;
      case of AE, AE should be recorded and followed up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If AE occurs during the trial, it needs to be followed up until the AE returns to normal or&#xD;
      stable state or abnormal, which has no clinical significance or is lost.&#xD;
