    <textblock>
      This study was a Randomized clinical trial. It was carried out in the physiotherapy&#xD;
      department of children hospital Lahore,those patients were taken who had congenital&#xD;
      clubfoot.40 patients were taken with the predetermined inclusive and exclusive criteria&#xD;
      through non probability convenience sampling technique.All participants informed about the&#xD;
      study,Group A received Low Dye taping Technique 2 times in a week for 6 weeks,while the group&#xD;
      B received the Robert Debre Methpod daily 30 minutes session for total 6 weeks.Foot posture,&#xD;
      range of motion and gait will be assessed by Demiglio bensahel and pirani scoring system with&#xD;
      the help of goniometer and compared the results.Data analyzed by SPSS 25.0 statistical&#xD;
      software. After checking the normality of data nonparametric tests applied to check the&#xD;
      difference between and within the groups.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Pirani scale:</measure>
    <time_frame>6th week</time_frame>
    <description>The Pirani scale scoring system describes 6 signs of contracture with a three point scale: 0= no abnormality, 0.5= moderate abnormality, 1= severe abnormality. Scores for three midfoot signs (MFS) and three hindfoot signs (HFS), both with a maximum score of three are combined for a total score (TFS) out of six. Increasing scores indicates increasing severity, with zero indicating an unaffected foot and six the most severe clubfoot.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Dimeglio Bensahel Classification:</measure>
    <time_frame>6th week</time_frame>
    <description>The Dimeglio classification scores eight items; reducibility of four range of motion criteria and presence of four structural criteria. Reducibility of equinus, varus, midfoot rotation and midfoot adductus is scored zero to four points. The scores assigned to different degrees of reducibility of the deformity were specified by the author when the classification system was initially developed.The presence of four structural criteria; cavus, MC, PC, and muscle abnormality is also scored. Structural criteria are scored as 0= absent or 1= present. 8 Scores for the four reducibility criteria and the four structural criteria combine for an overall score, with 20 indicating the most severe clubfoot and zero an unaffected foot.</description>

    <description>: There were 20 patients in group A which received the low dye taping technique. Low-dye is a classic taping method to reduces strain from plantar fascia and provide medial ankle arch support. If properly applied, reduces subtalar joint motion, pain, excessive pronation. Hence, it can be used in the treatment of ankle and foot.</description>
