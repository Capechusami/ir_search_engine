  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the benefit of IVIG in donor-derived&#xD;
      infections and the potential immunomodulatory effect on transplanted organs. The main&#xD;
      questions it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How effective IVIG is in preventing donor-derived infections&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does IVIG has potential immunomodulatory effect on transplanted organs&#xD;

      Donor-derived infections are defined as any infection present in the donor that is&#xD;
      transmitted to one or more recipient. Donor-derived infections can be categorized into two&#xD;
      groups: &quot;expected&quot; and &quot;unexpected&quot; infections. Expected transmissions occur when the donor&#xD;
      is known to have an infection, as demonstrated by positive serology or nucleic acid test&#xD;
      (NAT) result for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or hepatitis B and C, or&#xD;
      positive cultures in the donor at the time of donation. Unexpected transmissions may occur&#xD;
      despite current screening strategies and are not expected in the donor at the time of organ&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) are produced by pooling together of serum immunoglobulins&#xD;
      from multiple donors, and are known to have powerful immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      functions in vitro and in vivo. The goal of this study is to figure out the benefit of IVIG&#xD;
      in donor-derived infections and the potential immunomodulatory effect on transplanted organs.&#xD;
