  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyze acute responses of arm-cranking exercise on&#xD;
      cardiovascular function of peripheral arterial disease patients and compare it to the main&#xD;
      exercise recommendation, walking exercise.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty patients with peripheral arterial disease and claudication symptoms will be recruited.&#xD;
      The patients will perform three experimental conditions, in randomized order (walking,&#xD;
      arm-cranking and control). The exercise conditions will be composed of 15 bouts of 2 minutes&#xD;
      exercise with an intensity equivalent to 13-15 on Borg's Subjective Perceived Exertion Scale.&#xD;
      During the experimental conditions (walking, arm-cranking and control) blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate and cerebral blood velocity will be evaluated, along with perceived exertion and&#xD;
      affective responses. Before and after experimental conditions, vascular function, blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate variability, cerebral blood velocity, subjective perceived exertion and&#xD;
      affective responses will be evaluated.&#xD;
