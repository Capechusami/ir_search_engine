      The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about how a combination of tazemetostat and&#xD;
      venetoclax in people with relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (R/R NHL). The main&#xD;
      questions that this trial aims to answer are what is the best dose of venetoclax to give with&#xD;
      tazemetostat to people with R/R NHL; what types of side effects do people with R/R NHL get&#xD;
      when taking venetoclax with tazemetostat; and what effects does this combination have on R/R&#xD;
      NHL. Participants will need to take pills by mouth every day and regularly come to the clinic&#xD;
      for blood work and imagining to monitor side effects and cancer progression. Participants may&#xD;
      receive study drugs for up to 24 months.&#xD;

      This a phase 1, single arm, non-randomized trial of tazemetostat in combination with&#xD;
      venetoclax in participants with two types of relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the combination of tazemetostat and&#xD;
      venetoclax in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) Follicular Lymphoma (FL) and Diffuse&#xD;
      Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). This trial will be conducted in two parts. Part one will be a&#xD;
      single-arm, open-label sequential dose escalation (3+3) of venetoclax in combination with a&#xD;
      fixed dose of tazemetostat (800mg BID) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      venetoclax. In part two, two expansion cohorts (R/R DLBCL and R/R FL) will be enrolled to&#xD;
      further characterize the safety and tolerability of the combination, and to estimate the&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy. Up to 18 participants will be enrolled in part 1 and 20 participants&#xD;
      will be enrolled in part 2.&#xD;

    <description>In part 1 of this study, participants will be assigned a dose of venetoclax following a (3+3) dose escalation design and monitored for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first treatment cycle. Based on observed DLTs observed in each dose level cohort, the maximum-tolerated dose will be determined. The # of patients experiencing a DLT among the evaluable patients for each dose level in part 1 will be tabulated.</description>

    <description>The safety analysis population will consist of all enrolled patients who receive at least one dose of study drug.

For each patient, and within each type of toxicity, the patient will be counted only once at the highest grade of that toxicity. Participants will be evaluated for AEs/SAEs from the time they sign the informed consent form until 30 days after their last dose of study drug.</description>

    <description>All participants will receive a combination of oral 800 mg tazemetostat BID and oral venetoclax. Since this is a phase 1 trial, the dose of venetoclax will be determined by the investigators per a sequential dose escalation (3+3). Participants will be provided study drug in the form of pills to take at home. Study participants will need to regularly come to the clinic for blood work, imaging, and to monitor and side effects. Participants may receive study drug until their cancer progresses or for up to 24 months.</description>
