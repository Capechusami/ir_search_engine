  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common acquired neurological disease leading to&#xD;
      disability in young adults. MS often leads to the development of a physical and/or cognitive&#xD;
      impairment that disables patients in their daily lives. Early use of disease modifying&#xD;
      treatments for patients at risk of developing disability is therefore essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, disability progression is very heterogeneous between patients and currently&#xD;
      impossible to predict at the individual level. Thus, numerous studies, particularly&#xD;
      epidemiological and imaging studies, have identified prognostic factors for the development&#xD;
      of disability such as age, gender, number of relapses during the first years of the disease,&#xD;
      existence of a residual disability after a first relapse, number of gadolinium-enhancing&#xD;
      lesions on initial MRI, early brainstem and spinal cord lesions. However, these different&#xD;
      factors only explain incompletely the progression of the physical or cognitive disability in&#xD;
      MS patients. In particular, some components of MS pathophysiology, more related to the&#xD;
      progressive development of disability, such as axonal degeneration or the existence of&#xD;
      chronic inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) are usually not measured by these&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research project, the investigators will test promising biomarkers, focused on these&#xD;
      components of the disease, on a large cohort of patients in a multicenter setting, in order&#xD;
      to evaluate their added value to predict disability progression, in comparison with more&#xD;
      classical biomarkers such as clinical characteristics, and brain and spinal cord lesion load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the investigators will test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Imaging biomarkers extracted from brain and spinal cord MP2RAGE, brain and spinal cord&#xD;
           QSM, brain and spinal cord relaxometry, brain diffusion and spinal cord magnetization&#xD;
           transfer sequences&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biomarkers extracted from optical coherence tomography (OCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biological biomarkers (serum neurofilament-light chain (NFL) and Glial Fibrillary Acidic&#xD;
           Protein (GFAP))&#xD;
