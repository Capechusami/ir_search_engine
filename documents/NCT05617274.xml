    <textblock>
      Nine patients (five males and four females) were included in this study who had long-term&#xD;
      (10-15 years) of long-span rigid mandibular fixed prostheses that may have led to&#xD;
      radiographic changes around the supporting teeth. The treatment plans included the removal of&#xD;
      the long-span fixed rigid prostheses followed by restoring the patients with segmented&#xD;
      implant-supported prostheses. In order to digitally measure the mandibular flexure, reference&#xD;
      markers were adhered to the prostheses, and intraoral scans were obtained before and after&#xD;
      splitting the preexisting prostheses at the minimum and maximum mouth opening. The distances&#xD;
      between the markers were measured, and mandibular flexure was calculated by subtracting the&#xD;
      distance between the markers during the maximum mouth opening from the minimum mouth opening.&#xD;
      An independent sample T-test was used to compare mandibular flexure before and after&#xD;
      splitting the long-span fixed prostheses.&#xD;

        All had the entire mandibular natural dentition (6-8 abutments) splinted with a single-unit&#xD;
        metal-ceramic (long-span fixed prosthesis). All of them suffered from different negative&#xD;
        consequences of their one-piece fixed restorations. The retrospective collection of the&#xD;
        patient's data was tabulated and analyzed. Nine patients were included in this study. Five&#xD;
        males and four females, with an age range of 50-76 years were enrolled in this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  full-arch mandibular single fixed prostheses that served for many years (average 12&#xD;
             years) opposed by natural dentition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients were free from any systemic or debilitating diseases such as bone diseases,&#xD;
             diabetes melilites, or blood dyscrasias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with healthy fixed full-arch prosthesis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with segmented prosthesis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with systematic debilitating diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
