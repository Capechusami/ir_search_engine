  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized clinical trial evaluating how behaviorally-informed outreach&#xD;
      text messages impact patient engagement with primary care. This prospective randomized&#xD;
      control trial is being implemented in conjunction with UCLA Health's larger quality&#xD;
      improvement initiative (the My Action Plan Quality Improvement Initiative) in order to&#xD;
      improve primary care preventive measure completion rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health maintenance measures have been shown to be critical in early detection, secondary&#xD;
      prevention, and early management of numerous medical conditions--from diabetes to various&#xD;
      cancers. The standardization of these health maintenance measures have resulted in major&#xD;
      improvements in population health. Despite the importance of these primary care tests and&#xD;
      screenings, many patients are overdue for these tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given this healthcare gap, it is critical to investigate more effective strategies to&#xD;
      facilitate health maintenance measure completion. This study aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a variety of behaviorally-informed outreach text messages. The investigators&#xD;
      intend to launch the study as a part of UCLA Health's My Action Plan initiative, a UCLA&#xD;
      Health primary care outreach quality improvement initiative aimed at encouraging patients to&#xD;
      complete their overdue health maintenance measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the My Action Plan initiative is an outreach effort targeting primary care&#xD;
      patients at UCLA who have an outstanding, clinically indicated primary care preventative care&#xD;
      gap (e.g., overdue colorectal cancer screening, outstanding diabetes tests). At the beginning&#xD;
      of each month, identified UCLA Health primary care patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1&#xD;
      ratio to receive one of four text messages informing them that they have an overdue health&#xD;
      maintenance measures and urging them to taking action to complete these measures. These text&#xD;
      messages will contain a link to their MyChart patient portal account, specifically linking&#xD;
      them to a My Action Plan electronic letter that will contain a personalized list of&#xD;
      outstanding preventive care items and actionable steps to complete the items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each text-message arm, patients will also be randomized to one of three time slots for&#xD;
      getting the message.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The My Action Plan quality improvement initiative is expected to start at the beginning of&#xD;
      the 2023 calendar year and continue for a span of at least 12 months. Each month, the&#xD;
      initiative targets patients whose birthday falls into that month. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      run this randomized clinical trial during four months of the larger QI initiative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By studying how patients interact with these outreach messages and whether it then translates&#xD;
      to them completing their indicated health maintenance measures, the proposed study would&#xD;
      provide insightful information on how health systems could optimize electronic patient&#xD;
      outreach, narrow the gap in health maintenance measures in primary care, and ultimately&#xD;
      improve health on a population level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will utilize patient-level ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation,&#xD;
           with statistical inferences based on model-robust standard errors. The primary model&#xD;
           term will be indicator variables for arm assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The analysis will adjust for sex, age, race/ethnicity, indicators for screenings/tests&#xD;
           that patients are due for, and whether patients have upcoming primary care appointments.&#xD;
           Missing covariate values will be handled by including 'unknown' indicators, along with&#xD;
           mean imputation for quantitative covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will use this dataset to address two separate research questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research question 1: The investigators will compare Arm 1 with Arm 2 to test whether&#xD;
           more specific or general text message is more likely to improve the outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research question 2: The investigators will compare Arm 3, Arm 4, with Arm 2 to test&#xD;
           whether the general intention-oriented message and general action-oriented message can&#xD;
           outperform the general text message as well as which of these two messages is better.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For research question 2, exploratory analyses will investigate heterogeneous treatment&#xD;
           effects by patients' baseline motivation (i.e., the extent to which patients seem to&#xD;
           have some intentions to get the screenings/tests) in two ways. First, the investigators&#xD;
           will use each patient's history of screenings/tests to construct a proxy for their&#xD;
           baseline motivation to obtain the due screenings/tests. Specifically, the investigator&#xD;
           will calculate, among all the screenings/tests that are included in the My Action Plan&#xD;
           Initiative and that a patient was due for in the past few years (exact time window TBD&#xD;
           based on data availability), what percentage was completed by the patient (as far as&#xD;
           UCLA Health could tell). A higher percentage indicates a higher baseline motivation to&#xD;
           get the screenings/tests patients are due for during the study period. Second, the&#xD;
           investigators will obtain demographics and medical information that UCLA Health is&#xD;
           willing to provide (e.g., gender, age, race/ethnicity, history of cancer and other&#xD;
           pre-existing conditions, family cancer history, past adherence to screenings/tests that&#xD;
           are included in the My Action Plan Initiative, past receipt of influenza vaccination,&#xD;
           frequency of doctor visits; time window of these variables is TBD depending on data&#xD;
           availability). With such information, the investigators will train an algorithm to&#xD;
           predict patients' baseline motivation level using patients in Arm 2 as the ground truth.&#xD;
           Specifically, the investigators will take the aforementioned information about patients&#xD;
           in Arm 2 as input, and use whether they complete any of the screenings/visits&#xD;
           recommended in the My Action Plan letter within 6 months as the outcome measure. Then&#xD;
           the investigators will apply the algorithm to all patients to predict their baseline&#xD;
           motivation level. For both approaches, the proxy for baseline motivation (Approach 1)&#xD;
           and the predicted baseline motivation level (Approach 2) will be used to analyze the&#xD;
           heterogeneous treatment effects of Arms 3 and 4 (vs. Arm 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additionally the investigators will investigate proxies for whether patients face&#xD;
           structural barriers to get screenings/tests as moderators, including socioeconomic&#xD;
           factors at the zipcode level, insurance type, proxies for accessibility to healthcare&#xD;
           resources such as distance from UCLA Health clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators will also explore how the effect of text messages varies across the&#xD;
           three times of the day when the reminders will be sent.&#xD;
