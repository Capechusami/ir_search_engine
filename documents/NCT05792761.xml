  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are nearly 2 million HBsAg-positive children who are in urgent need of professional&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment in China. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is the leading cause of childhood&#xD;
      liver disease. After infected with HBV virus, some children will develop disease progression,&#xD;
      and some even develop cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. In pediatric liver cancer cases, up to&#xD;
      34% ~ 95% are caused by HBV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although two major classes of drugs have been approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis&#xD;
      B in adults, and there are multiple guidelines worldwide for the management of HBV infection&#xD;
      in adults, there is lack of guidelines specifically for the management of children with HBV&#xD;
      infection. In addition, the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in children faced great&#xD;
      difficulties due to the lack of evidence-based medical evidence for antiviral treatment of&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis B in children and fewer drugs approved for anti-HBV treatment in children.&#xD;
      The timing of treatment, medications, and clinical management strategies are all&#xD;
      controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study ( Sprout project)，is a multicenter, prospective, cohort study in China, aiming to&#xD;
      explore and optimize the antiviral treatment regimen for children with HBV infection, to&#xD;
      provide evidence-based medical for antiviral treatment, and to provide basis evidence for the&#xD;
      standardized management of children infection with HBV in China. The study is expected to&#xD;
      enroll 1900 pediatric patients with HBV infection, and patient will received one of the three&#xD;
      following treatment Strategies: nucleoside monotherapy, peginterferon α- combined with&#xD;
      nucleoside therapy, or peginterferon α-pulse therapy combined with nucleoside therapy,&#xD;
      according to their illness state and desire, and the safety and efficacy will be evaluated.&#xD;
