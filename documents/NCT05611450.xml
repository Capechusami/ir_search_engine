  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's purpose is to understand the self-management needs of patients with NSCLC&#xD;
      receiving targeted therapy, develop a disease self- management application (mHealth&#xD;
      Application), and explore the effect of mHealth application on the self-efficacy and health&#xD;
      status of patients receiving targeted therapy for NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study adopts a two-group (pre-and-post-test) design experiment. This study is being&#xD;
      conducted over a period of 3 years and is divided in two stages. This study enrolled patients&#xD;
      with NSCLC in the outpatient clinic and ward of the Division of Chest Medicine in a northern&#xD;
      medical center as the research participants. Stage 1 develop a disease self-management&#xD;
      application and understands participants' needs by qualitative study. The participants are a&#xD;
      purposive sample of 15-20 patients. Data discontinued when theme saturation is achieved.&#xD;
      Stage 2 adopted convenient sampling to enroll 108 patients (54 in the experimental group and&#xD;
      54 in the control group) to evaluate the effectiveness of the disease self-management&#xD;
      application. After participant's consent was obtained, this study performed the pre-test and&#xD;
      randomized the participants. The experimental group received both routine care and the&#xD;
      disease self-management App, while the control group received routine care and part of&#xD;
      application. This study collected data before the patients received targeted therapy and in&#xD;
      months 1, 3, 6, and 9 after treatment initiation.&#xD;
