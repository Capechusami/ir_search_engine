      This research was planned as a randomized controlled experimental study to reduce the anxiety&#xD;
      expectant mothers feel when on a non-stress test.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fetal well-being is assessed by evaluating fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns. The primary aim&#xD;
      is to identify fetuses at risk of intrauterine death or neonatal complications and, if&#xD;
      possible, intervene (usually by delivery) to prevent these adverse outcomes. The most&#xD;
      commonly used method for this purpose is the non-stress test. Non-stress test (NST) is a&#xD;
      non-invasive fetal evaluation method. The NST is evaluated for at least 20 minutes while the&#xD;
      expectant mother is lying supine or left-side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is a painless procedure, it takes about 20 minutes, and the pregnant woman stays&#xD;
      in the same position throughout the procedure, creating although there are many methods to&#xD;
      reduce stress, it is thought that a cheap and easily accessible stress ball can be used as a&#xD;
      method of distraction or distraction. Although there are studies investigating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of stress balls in managing various disease groups and symptoms in the&#xD;
      literature, no study has been found to examine the NST effectiveness of stress balls. This&#xD;
      research was planned as a randomized controlled experimental study to reduce the stress felt&#xD;
      by women who had a non-stress test during pregnancy by applying a stress ball during the&#xD;
      procedure. anxiety for the pregnant woman. The fact that the pregnant woman has high anxiety&#xD;
      during the procedure affects the test result and may increase the false-positive rate and&#xD;
      cause false evaluation. This increase in the false-positive rate in NST results may lead to&#xD;
      an increase in an operative delivery. However, it is the midwives' responsibility to&#xD;
      eliminate the situations that cause anxiety in pregnant women, which may affect the NST&#xD;
      result before and during the procedure.&#xD;

    <measure>the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI/1-2) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>between one to six months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale, developed by Spielberg in 1973, consists of 40 questions. It is a 4-point Likert type scale (1=not at all, 4=very much). The lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 20, and the highest score is 80. The higher the score is, the higher the anxiety level is. The alpha value of the scale is 0.86-.92.33. The validity and reliability study in our country was conducted by Oner et al., in 1983 and the alpha value was found between. The scale that will be used to evaluate the state and trait anxiety of pregnant women. As the score increases, it is determined that the anxiety is higher.</description>

    <description>The woman is usually laid in the last side position during the procedure. A stress ball will be given to the right hand of the participants during the NST procedure (average 15-20 minutes). This stress ball will be squeezed for 2-3 seconds, and then the hand and arm will be told to relax. This process will be repeated throughout the NST. Hospital protocol will also be applied to these participants.</description>
