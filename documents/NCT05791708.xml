  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multi-center, observational, prospective, longitudinal disease&#xD;
      registry designed to collect data on participants with cold agglutinin disease (CAD) or cold&#xD;
      agglutinin syndrome (CAS). Among them, a minimum of 30 patients with CAD treated with&#xD;
      sutimlimab are expected to take part in the sutimlimab cohort study. Patients with CAD who&#xD;
      have been enrolled in previous sutimlimab clinical trials (e.g., BIVV009-01/LTS16214&#xD;
      [NCT02502903,CAD patients], BIVV009-03/EFC16215 [NCT03347396], and BIVV009-04/EFC16216&#xD;
      [NCT03347422]) and who either completed or discontinued the corresponding clinical trial are&#xD;
      eligible to participate in the registry.&#xD;
