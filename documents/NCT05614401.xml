    <textblock>
      The goal of this observational study is to learn about the long-term efficacy of our previous&#xD;
      study in acute ischemic stroke(AIS) patients who underwent either remote ischemic&#xD;
      postconditioning(RIPC) or sham treatment after intravenous thrombolysis. The main questions&#xD;
      it aims to answer are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose the RIPC treatment combined with IV thrombolysis can improve the long-term&#xD;
           functional outcome in AIS patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose the RIPC treatment combined with IV thrombolysis can improve the incidence rates of&#xD;
           all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, recurrent stroke/TIA, new-onset clinical AF on&#xD;
           this long-term follow-up? A single rater (A.E.P.) trained by an experienced stroke&#xD;
           physician (S.T.E.) contacted patients, relatives, and family physicians to gather all&#xD;
           available medical information on the following issues: 1) survival status, 2) date of&#xD;
           death in those who died (based on information of the treating physicians), 3) mRS score&#xD;
           at the time of the interview, 4) recurrent stroke/TIA, 5) new onset atrial fibrillation,&#xD;
           6) other cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism,&#xD;
           deep venous thrombosis, peripheral arteriopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will compare RIPC group and control group to see if the RIPC treatment have a&#xD;
      long-term effect in AIS patients.&#xD;

        Between August 2017 and June 2018, a total of 68 AIS patients who underwent IVT treatment&#xD;
        were randomized into either the RIPC treatment group or the control group. During the trial&#xD;
        period, thirty-four participants in the control group and thirty-two participants in the&#xD;
        RIPC group were followed for the percentage of patients at 90 days with a favorable&#xD;
        outcome, which was de- fined as a score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin Score (mRS). After&#xD;
        the completion of the trial, the trial participants were followed by their primary care&#xD;
        physicians.&#xD;
