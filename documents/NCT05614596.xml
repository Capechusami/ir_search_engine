  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is a major cause of substantial disability. It is usually defined as&#xD;
      pain, muscle tension, or stiffness localized below the costal margin and above the inferior&#xD;
      gluteal folds, with or without leg pain (sciatica).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic low back pain is defined as the pain that persists for 12 weeks or longer without a&#xD;
      response to treatment procedures or the improvement of the underlying cause. Radiculopathy or&#xD;
      radicular pain occurs when specific lumbosacral nerve roots are affected, and radicular pain&#xD;
      develops due to the irritation of the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). It is characterized by a&#xD;
      lumbar pain irradiated to one or more lumbar or sacral dermatomes. Use of fluoroscopy and&#xD;
      computed tomography has revolutionized the interventional treatments for chronic low back&#xD;
      pain by providing excellent guidance to the needle placement, as well as recognizing improper&#xD;
      placements such as intravascular or unintended intrathecal placements of needles and thus&#xD;
      avoiding morbidity in the form of injury to the intra-spinal structures including spinal&#xD;
      cord, nerve roots and blood vessels. Percutaneous guided interventions such as pulsed&#xD;
      radiofrequency (PRF) and transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) guided by&#xD;
      flouroscopy and computed tomography (CT) are safe and effective procedures for the management&#xD;
      of chronic RLBP, which can be performed in an outpatient setting without sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional radiologists already possess the technical skills necessary to perform these&#xD;
      interventions effectively. Pulsed radiofrequency is one of the interventional therapies for&#xD;
      LBP, which uses radiofrequency alternating current to ablate the tissue around the needle&#xD;
      electrode. Transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI), as a minimally invasive&#xD;
      interventional surgery, is widely used in the treatment of LBP. It has the advantages of less&#xD;
      trauma, fewer complications, and faster onset. It relieves symptoms by injecting&#xD;
      corticosteroids and local anesthetics around the dural and nerve roots that cause radicular&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TFESI combined with PRF for the treatment of RLBP effectively and rapidly relieve radicular&#xD;
      pain, reduce VAS (visual analog scale), relieve pain symptoms, improve the quality of life,&#xD;
      cure rate, and satisfaction of patients, as well as, achieve long-term remission.&#xD;
