      The aim of this study was to evaluate and determine the clinical performance of Fecal&#xD;
      Pancreatic Elastase 1 Test in the diagnosis of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fecal Pancreatic Elastase 1 (PE-1)Test has high diagnostic accuracy in pancreatic exocrine&#xD;
      insufficiency (PEI), has become a painless noninvasive diagnostic modality in clinical&#xD;
      practice, and has been widely used in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in China, the diagnostic ability of the PE-1 test in the Chinese population has not&#xD;
      been demonstrated and has not been reported. Meanwhile, pancreatin stimulation, 13C-mixed&#xD;
      triglyceride breath test, and N-benzoyl-L-tyrosyl-p-aminobenzoic acid test required drugs,&#xD;
      which cannot pass the examination of the drug administration and were not allowed to be&#xD;
      carried out to diagnose PEI in China. In addition pancreatin stimulation is an invasive test&#xD;
      has certain risks for subjects and 72-hour fecal fat quantification was mainly used for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of severe PEI. Therefore, This study adopted strict clinical diagnosis as a&#xD;
      comparative method for PE-1 test to judge the ability of PE-1 test to diagnose PEI in the&#xD;
      Chinese population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to clarify the application efficacy of PE-1 test in PEI through a&#xD;
      multi-center, prospective clinical study comparing PE-1 test with strict clinical diagnosis.&#xD;
      To study the accuracy of PE-1 test in the diagnosis of PEI.&#xD;
