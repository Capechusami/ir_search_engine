  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator wish to carry out this study to explore the link between patient-ventilator&#xD;
      asynchrony with the efficiency and tolerance of NIV but also the quality of life in patients&#xD;
      with chronic respiratory failure on long-term ventilation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic respiratory failure (CRF) is an advanced stage of many respiratory diseases marked by&#xD;
      an inability of the respiratory system to ensure vital gas exchange. It affects approximately&#xD;
      3.6 million people in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) remains the reference treatment in hypercapnic respiratory&#xD;
      failure because it reduces inspiratory muscles's work and promotes alveolar ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The establishment of the NIV is carried out most of the time following an episode of acute&#xD;
      decompensation revealing an underlying CRF. It is carried out and supervised in hospital&#xD;
      departments to optimize the understanding and adherence of the patient to his illness and his&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, monitoring is a key to measure the tolerance and effectiveness of ventilation.&#xD;
      Classically, it is based on multi-year medical consultations, blood gases and nocturnal&#xD;
      oximetry. In recent years, the reading of detailed data from software integrated into NIV&#xD;
      machines has been increasingly used in current practice in association with the monitoring&#xD;
      tools already recommended. It provides additional detailed information on compliance, leaks,&#xD;
      apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), obstructive events and asynchrony between the patient and their&#xD;
      ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patient-ventilator asynchronies have been described in studies with a negative impact on&#xD;
      the quality of ventilation, the quality of sleep under NIV and an increased risk of&#xD;
      mortality. However, not all asynchronies have the same consequences and are not all felt by&#xD;
      the patient&#xD;
