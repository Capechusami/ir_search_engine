    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase I clinical study of the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ascending doses of XC243 after single and multiple&#xD;
      oral administration in healthy volunteers. It's planned to include sequentially 2 cohorts of&#xD;
      7 volunteers who will receive a single dose of XC243 (50 mg and 100 mg) or placebo (cohort&#xD;
      ratio 5:2), 1 cohort of 14 volunteers who will receive a single dose of XC243 200 mg or&#xD;
      placebo first on an empty stomach, and after the washing period after eating (cohort ratio&#xD;
      12:2) and 1 cohort of 10 volunteers who will receive XC243 200 mg or placebo on an empty&#xD;
      stomach during 14 days (cohort ratio 8:2).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in 1 centre. The study will consist of 3 parts: single-dose&#xD;
      ascending study, single-dose food effect study for dose 200 mg, repeated dose study of 200 mg&#xD;
      over 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers of single dosing cohorts will receive the investigated drug (ID) ХС243 or&#xD;
      placebo once and stay at the study center for at least 24 hours after the ID administration&#xD;
      to monitor the safety parameters and for sampling for PK analysis. The Follow-up will last 7&#xD;
      days, during which safety parameters and PK in volunteers will be studied. Based on all&#xD;
      safety data from the XC243 50 mg cohort, the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will&#xD;
      consider dose increase and entry of the 100 mg cohort. If the single dose of ХС243 100 mg is&#xD;
      considered to be safe, the third dosing cohort of 200 mg will be included in the single-dose&#xD;
      food effect study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers of third dosing cohort will receive the ID ХС243 (200 mg) or placebo once on&#xD;
      an empty stomach.The Follow-up will last 7 days, during which safety parameters and PK in&#xD;
      volunteers will be studied. The washing period will last 7 days, after which volunteers will&#xD;
      receive the ID ХС243 (200 mg) or placebo once after eating. The Follow-up will last 7 days&#xD;
      too. If the single dose of ХС243 200 mg is considered to be safe, the fourth multiple dosing&#xD;
      cohort of repeated dose of 200 mg will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers from multiple dosing cohort will receive the ID (ХС243 or placebo) once a day&#xD;
      during 14 days and will stay at the hospital (study center) within 15 days. The Follow-up&#xD;
      will last 14 days, during which they will study safety parameters and PK in volunteers.&#xD;
