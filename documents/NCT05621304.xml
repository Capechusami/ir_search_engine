      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who were born outside of the country are the largest group of adults infected with&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the US. HBV affects the liver. If not treated, HBV&#xD;
      infection can lead to serious liver disease, including cancer. One recent study showed that&#xD;
      only 35% of foreign-born US adults were aware of their HBV infections. Foreign-born US adults&#xD;
      may also have trouble getting proper care after they are diagnosed with HBV. In one small&#xD;
      survey, language, cultural, and financial barriers were cited as the biggest reasons for not&#xD;
      receiving care. To help more people with HBV, researchers want to learn how to find and&#xD;
      overcome any barriers to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This natural history study seeks to identify and better understand barriers that prevent&#xD;
      foreign-born US adults from getting proper care for HBV infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People aged 18 years and older with chronic HBV who were born outside of the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the NIH clinic 1 time. This visit will take about 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will review participants medical records and collect information about their HBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a survey. They will answer questions about:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where they came from.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When they came to the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How well they have adapted to living in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health care they have received for HBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their age, gender, and education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be paid $10 for completing the survey.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational, prospective study in which Foreign-Born (FB) participants with&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) will be consented and then surveyed to better understand and&#xD;
      identify acculturation-related barriers in the HBV care cascade and to optimize healthcare&#xD;
      retention for those with HBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To assess the association between recent immigration (defined by less than 10 years length&#xD;
      of residence in US) and progression through the HBV care cascade post-diagnosis among&#xD;
      foreign-born diagnosed with chronic HBV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize and quantify completion of HBV care metrics after diagnosis (both&#xD;
           proportion and time to completion) for a multi-ethnic cohort of foreign-born adults&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare gaps in completion of post-diagnosis care metrics by recent immigrant status&#xD;
           and racial/ethnic group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop and pilot a multi-national survey instrument to accurately and reliably&#xD;
           measure immigration-related factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine impact of immigration-related factors (e.g. acculturation, language&#xD;
           proficiency, region of origin) on completion of care metrics overall and among recent&#xD;
           immigrants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The primary endpoint is to assess the proportion of FB diagnosed with HBV who have completed&#xD;
      an initial visit for diagnosis of chronic HBV infection (defined as a visit with either&#xD;
      primary or specialty provider during which testing for treatment eligibility was ordered).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of testing to determine eligibility for treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Minimum sufficient set of labs including hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg), ALT, HBV&#xD;
                DNA, and HIV testing&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fibrosis assessment which can be non-invasive (FIB-4/APRI, US elastography or MR&#xD;
                elastography) or invasive (liver biopsy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment uptake if eligible based on AASLD guidelines on treatment eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HBV DNA&gt;2000 IU/mL and ALT&gt;2x ULN if HBeAgnegative&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  HBV DNA&gt;20000 IU/mL and ALT&gt;2x ULN if HBeAgpositive&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cirrhosis or HCC&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Family history of HCC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retention in care&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At least annual visit for HBV diagnosis with appropriate lab tests ordered&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ultrasound and AFP for HCC surveillance screening for those who are indicated&#xD;
