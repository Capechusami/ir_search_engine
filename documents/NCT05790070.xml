  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether there is a synergistic effect via combining&#xD;
      both low-load blood flow restriction (BFR) training and betaine supplementation loading&#xD;
      (6g/day for 14 days) on skeletal muscle anabolic signaling pathways that is mediated by&#xD;
      enhancements in intracellular water. These effects are proposed to be greater than either BFR&#xD;
      training or betaine supplementation alone or compared to control conditions (high-load&#xD;
      non-occluded and/or placebo supplementation).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the investigation is to determine whether the combination of blood flow&#xD;
      restriction (BFR) training and betaine supplementation can synergistically augment&#xD;
      phosphorylated targets associated with mechanotransduction and/or muscle protein synthesis&#xD;
      relative to either modality alone and compared against control conditions (standard&#xD;
      &quot;high-intensity&quot; resistance training and placebo supplementation) in healthy young males.&#xD;
      Secondly, the investigators aim to determine if any potential synergistic effects are&#xD;
      mediated by enhanced intracellular fluid volumes, as determined by the changes in water&#xD;
      content between hydrated and dehydrated muscle samples, as well as through changes in both&#xD;
      muscle and serum betaine concentrations. Finally, the investigators aim to assess differences&#xD;
      in the aforementioned interventions on specific gene targets, the betaine/Î³-aminobutyric acid&#xD;
      transporter, myosin heavy chain I, IIa, and IIx lactate dehydrogenase A. Therefore, the&#xD;
      specific aims of this study are to determine in healthy, young males: 1) whether combined BFR&#xD;
      training and betaine supplementation significantly augment mechanotransductive&#xD;
      growth-associated post-translational protein modifications via extra-to-intracellular fluid&#xD;
      flux, alongside 2) potentially altered gene expression that otherwise characterizes&#xD;
      phenotypical/biochemical changes in skeletal muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study are to determine whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The combination of BFR training and betaine supplementation demonstrates significantly&#xD;
           greater phosphorylated FAK, ERK1/2, IRS1, and p70S6K, commensurate with greater&#xD;
           wet-to-dry hydration changes, relative to any other combinations between BFR training,&#xD;
           standard &quot;high-load&quot; training, betaine supplementation, and/or placebo ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The combination of BFR training and betaine supplementation will result in increased&#xD;
           MYH2 gene expression, alongside decreases in MYH7 and MYH1 expression. Furthermore, this&#xD;
           combination will also result in the highest degree of HIF-1 and Ldha, as well as the&#xD;
           lowest BGT-1 gene expression relative to baseline levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The combination of BFR training and betaine supplementation will result in a higher&#xD;
           load-volume accumulated relative to BFR-alone, and will not be statistically different&#xD;
           than high-load-placebo training. Therein, the high-load-betaine group will have the&#xD;
           greatest load-volume amidst any other combination of conditions.&#xD;
