      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this multi-site, community-based, two-arm randomized controlled&#xD;
      feasibility trial is to evaluate the feasibility of recruitment, retention, and adherence to&#xD;
      the HH intervention and attention control conditions and acceptability of assessments across&#xD;
      sites. Black adults who are insufficiently active will be randomized to the HH intervention&#xD;
      or an attention control group. We hypothesize that we will meet our recruitment goal of 50&#xD;
      participants per site (10 participants per month), &gt;80% of participants will be retained at&#xD;
      post-intervention and follow-up, and &gt;80% will adhere to sessions. After follow-up, we will&#xD;
      conduct interviews with community partners (n=2), delivery agents (n=2), and participants&#xD;
      (n=20) at each site (N=44 total) to assess acceptance and refine training and implementation&#xD;
      protocols in preparation for a future large-scale multi-site randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      test the efficacy of HH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include assessing changes in sitting time, physical activity, and&#xD;
      psychosocial wellbeing from baseline to post-intervention as defined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sitting time. Sitting time will be measured using an activPAL, a small and slim&#xD;
           thigh-worn device that directly measures postural aspects of sedentary behavior (e.g.,&#xD;
           sitting, lying down, upright), and provides time spent sitting and bouts. Additionally,&#xD;
           self-reported sedentary behavior will be assessed via the Sedentary Behavior&#xD;
           Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physical activity. Physical activity will be measured using an activPAL, a small and&#xD;
           slim thigh-worn device that directly measures steps and intensity-specific physical&#xD;
           activity duration. Additionally, self-reported physical activity will be assessed via&#xD;
           the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Psychosocial wellbeing. Psychosocial wellbeing, including perceived stress, depressive&#xD;
           symptoms, and quality of life, will be assessed using the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale&#xD;
           (PSS), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and SF-36 Short Form&#xD;
           Health Survey.&#xD;

    <description>The 10-item PSS will be used to measure the degree to which participants appraise situations in their life as stressful. Scores range from 0 to 40, and higher scores indicate greater perceived stress. The PSS has been found valid and reliable for use in diverse populations.</description>
