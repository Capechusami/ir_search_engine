  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the current project is to develop and test Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI) -&#xD;
      Imager, to promote and improve stress resilience, specifically to increase reward&#xD;
      sensitivity. EMIs are mostly smartphone-based applications that deliver interventions to&#xD;
      people as they go about in their daily lives. The EMI developed and tested here is based on&#xD;
      theoretical and empirical findings and consists of several items and a repeated training&#xD;
      using various individual scenarios from participants' life that will be presented to&#xD;
      participants via an app on their smartphones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study tests the feasibility and effects of the EMI on a change in (i) reward&#xD;
      sensitivity, (ii) mental imagery, and (iii) indices of perceived stress. One hundred twenty&#xD;
      healthy student participants, aged 18-29 will be included in the study. Participants will be&#xD;
      screened first and included if they score 5 points or more on the Reward Sensitivity Subscale&#xD;
      of Behavioral Avoidance/Inhibition (BIS/BAS) scales. This is necessary in order to avoid a&#xD;
      ceiling effect. Then, participants will be randomly assigned to an experimental (reward&#xD;
      sensitivity EMI) or two of the control conditions (control EMA or waitlist). The reward&#xD;
      sensitivity EMI group will be taught about experiencing rewards in daily life and will be&#xD;
      asked to apply the specific techniques to personal situations repeatedly. The control EMA&#xD;
      group will use the same app consisting of Ecological Momentary Assessment only, and the&#xD;
      waitlist group will not receive any mobile app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The training will last seven consecutive days and the app will send (i) 10 prompts per day to&#xD;
      ask about the current mood of the user in control EMA and experimental groups and (ii) three&#xD;
      prompts per day resulting in a total of 21 reward training sessions only in the experimental&#xD;
      group. Participants will be able to use a special button triggering the intervention or EMA&#xD;
      by themselves too. After one week, participants will return to the lab, fill in&#xD;
      questionnaires and participate in behavioral tasks.&#xD;
