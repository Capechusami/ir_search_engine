      This study has the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Test the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a 5-week acupuncture&#xD;
      intervention within federally qualified health center oncology clinic to manage multiple&#xD;
      symptoms (pain, hot flashes, fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety) among breast&#xD;
      cancer survivors receiving endocrine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Use a mixed methods approach to identify barriers and facilitators associated with&#xD;
      implementing acupuncture in federally qualified health center oncology clinic.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability for Treating Multiple Symptoms with Acupuncture</measure>
    <time_frame>At week 6 after finishing the 10th acupuncture treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Protocol Acceptability Scale is a 9-item instrument with scores ranging from 0 to 18 used to measure acceptability of the study processes and protocols. Items are measured on a 0 to 2 scale, where 0 means &quot;did not like the study/did not like acupuncture/did not enjoy participating&quot;, and 2 means &quot;liked the study/liked acupuncture/enjoyed participating&quot;. The protocol was deemed to have high acceptability if 80% of participants scored ≥ 80% of possible points on the acceptability scale. The investigators calculated the mean score for each of the 9 questions, divided the total score for the 9 questions by the maximum possible points for the measure, and converted the total mean scores to percentage of participants who liked the study/liked acupuncture/enjoyed participating.</description>
