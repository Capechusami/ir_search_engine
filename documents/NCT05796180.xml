  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX) is a 6-point Likert-type self-report scale and consists of 5 questions. This form reveals the capacity to reach orgasm, the feeling of satisfaction, vaginal wetness, arousal and sexual drive. Each question is scored from 1 to 6. The total score ranges from 5 to 30. Low scores indicate that the sexual response is satisfactory, strong and easy, while high scores indicate the presence of sexual dysfunction. The total scale score is formed by the sum of the scores of the scale items in the scale. The cut-off point of the scale was determined as 11. A score of 5 or more for each item indicates that there is a sexual dysfunction related to that item.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Female Sexual Satisfaction Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week</time_frame>
    <description>The scale has 24 sub-dimensions of satisfaction, communication, agreeableness, personal concern and relational concern and consists of 30 items. In 29 items, a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot; is used. For one item, a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;totally satisfactory&quot; to &quot;not at all satisfactory&quot; is used. Average scores are calculated for each subscale. Higher scores are interpreted as more sexual satisfaction. For each sub-dimension in the scale, the lowest score is 6.0 and the highest score is 30.0. Total Score = Satisfaction + Communication + Compliance + (Relational Worry + Personal Worry) /2 formula is used to calculate the total score of the scale. Accordingly, the lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 24.0, and the highest score is 120.0.</description>

    <description>Sexual health counseling based on the BETTER model&#xD;
The content of the research will be discussed by face-to-face interviews with women who gave birth vaginally and applied to the hospital for birth control 8-10 weeks after delivery. Pre-evaluation forms will be applied to women who have agreed to participate in the study to evaluate the inclusion criteria. Women who meet the inclusion criteria will be divided into experimental-control groups using the block randomization method.&#xD;
An appointment will be made for interviews with the women in the experimental group. It is planned that these meetings will be held in the form of online video calls and will last an average of 45 minutes. The final tests will be held 4 weeks after the online meetings are over.</description>
