    <textblock>
      The purpose study is to test the effects of accelerated resolution therapy (ART) on pre-loss&#xD;
      grief and complicated grief among older adult family caregivers (FCGs). Additionally, to&#xD;
      better understand predictors of response to ART, and cognitive processes that occur among&#xD;
      grieving individuals following ART.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART) is an evidence-based treatment for post-traumatic&#xD;
      distress in civilians and veterans that may be useful in alleviating maladaptive grief prior&#xD;
      to bereavement and could prevent prolonged, complicated grief following bereavement.&#xD;
      Researchers are proposing to test the efficacy of ART, a low-risk, brief therapy with a&#xD;
      strong theoretical rationale for treatment success in maladaptive grief and supported by the&#xD;
      promising results of a recently completed preliminary trial. Additional aims of the study are&#xD;
      to examine changes in cognitive appraisal and integration of loss following ART using a mixed&#xD;
      methods approach and to evaluate personal, social, and psychological factors predictors of&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the proposed double blinded, randomized, controlled two arm clinical trial, older&#xD;
      adult family caregivers will receive either ART or an educational program that is matched for&#xD;
      time and attention. Each participant will receive four sessions of either the ART&#xD;
      intervention or the control intervention. Data collection will occur at screening/enrollment&#xD;
      (T1), at the end of the 4-session intervention period (T2) and at 6-months (T3) and 12-months&#xD;
      post bereavement (T4). A subgroup of 20 participants randomly assigned to ART will&#xD;
      participate in semi-structured interviews to enhance understanding of cognitive appraisal and&#xD;
      integration of loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will provide critical information on the efficacy of the ART intervention as a&#xD;
      potential first-line treatment option for pre-loss grief and preventative option for&#xD;
      complicated grief and contribute new information about characteristics of individuals most&#xD;
      likely to benefit from ART.&#xD;
