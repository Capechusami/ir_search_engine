      neuropathic pain in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDM).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-phase study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 is a double blinded, two-arm, randomized, multi-center clinical trial to assess&#xD;
      1-month efficacy as compared to a sham group. Up to approximately 80 subjects diagnosed with&#xD;
      painful diabetic neuropathy will be randomized 3:1 into one of two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Axon Therapy plus CMM (AT+CMM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sham plus CMM (Sham+CMM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be consented, screened, and then undergo a 7-day baseline assessment period.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to record pain, numbness, and sleep scores via a twice daily&#xD;
      electronic diary. Subjects who meet inclusion criteria, including diary compliance, will&#xD;
      undergo an in-clinic baseline evaluation (Day 1), be randomized, and start their treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will return to the clinic for treatments as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ● Day 1 - 30: 6 treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 1: 3 treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 2-4: Weekly treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will return to the clinic for follow-up assessment at Day 30 (± 5 days). At the&#xD;
      Day 30 visits subjects will be asked if they want to participate in Phase 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 of the study is an unblinded, one-arm, multi-center trial to assess extended efficacy&#xD;
      of the treatment. At Day 30, subjects will be unblinded and allowed to remain in the study&#xD;
      for an additional 60 (AT+CMM) to 90 (ATx+CMM) days. Those in the Sham arm can choose to&#xD;
      crossover to active treatment ( ATx+CMM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the AT+CMM arm will return to the clinic as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Month 2: Bi-weekly treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Month 3: Treatments every 2-4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional treatments to treat flare ups; defined as an episode of pain with a VAS 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the ATx+CMM arm will return to the clinic as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Month 2: 6 treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Week 1: 3 treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Week 2-4: Weekly treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Month 3: Bi-weekly treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Month 4: Treatments every 2-4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional treatments to treat flare ups; defined as an episode of pain with a VAS 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who do not choose to remain in the study will be monitored for 30 days for AEs and&#xD;
      then they will exit the study. The subject's reason for exiting the study will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to in-clinic assessments and treatments, all subjects will complete an electronic&#xD;
      twice daily diary through Day 30 of the study (Day 60 for ATx+CMM subjects). Subjects will&#xD;
      receive weekly phone follow-up for diary reminders and to assess for the occurrence of&#xD;
      adverse events. Weekly phone follow-up will occur only during weeks when the subject is not&#xD;
      seen in the clinic.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Subjects and clinical study staff (with the sole exception of the Blinding Operator) will be blinded to study treatment.&#xD;
Steps for setting up the device are extremely similar whether the patient is in the Sham or Active groups. The following steps must be completed before the patient or the Operator have entered the room for their session. Please avoid any unnecessary interactions with the patient, Operator or any other Clinic personnel in the performance of these tasks.&#xD;
The primary security method for protecting the Blind is strict utilization of Medrio and the special permissions granted by the Sponsor for the conduct of Blinding and Unblinding subjects.</masking_description>

             peripheral neuropathic pain; subjects with significant somatic pain at the site of&#xD;
             their trauma that may confound assessment or self-evaluation of their neuropathic&#xD;
             pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participation in any other clinical trial within the 30 days prior to screening and/or&#xD;
             during participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any subject considered at risk of suicide or self-harm based on investigator judgment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions, or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality, or other factors that may increase the risk associated with study&#xD;
             participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with&#xD;
             compliance or the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator would make the subject inappropriate to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects with pending Worker's Compensation, Worker's Compensation, civil litigation,&#xD;
             or disability claims. Subjects with fully resolved litigation and compensation claims&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Subjects who have had a diagnosis of malignancy other than basal cell carcinoma, or&#xD;
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix within the past five years, to include life expectancy&#xD;
             less than 1 year due to advanced malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects with implantable &quot;electrical&quot; medical devices such as a cardiac pacemaker,&#xD;
             defibrillator, or insulin pump within four (4) inches or less of the site of pain to&#xD;
             be treated by Axon Therapy. (Subject with an implantable device greater than four (4)&#xD;
             inches from the site of pain to be treated should NOT be excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Phantom limb pain or pain that feels like it is coming from a body part that is no&#xD;
             longer there.&#xD;
