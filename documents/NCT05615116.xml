      In this study, the microbiota sequencing was used to investigate the changes of microbiota in&#xD;
      the terminal ileum and the middle part of ascending colon, the mesenteric adipose tissue of&#xD;
      ileum and ascending mesocolon, and oral cavity of patients with Crohn's disease before and&#xD;
      after ileocecal resection, so as to further explore the role of ileocecal region in inducing&#xD;
      remission of disease.&#xD;
