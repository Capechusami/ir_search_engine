    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, open-label, single ascending dose study of RGX-381, a gene therapy&#xD;
      for the potential treatment of ocular manifestations of CLN2 (Batten disease). RGX-381 is&#xD;
      being studied as a potential treatment of ocular manifestations of neuronal ceroid&#xD;
      lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease. Children with CLN2 disease have a non-working gene (set&#xD;
      of instructions) that causes an enzyme called tripeptidyl-peptidase 1 (TPP1) to be missing or&#xD;
      not working in their bodies. Without enough TPP1, cells cannot break down certain molecules&#xD;
      in the body, so these storage materials build up and start to hurt the body, particularly the&#xD;
      central nervous system (the brain and spine) and retinal cells (eyes); cause seizures; and&#xD;
      change how children with CLN2 disease grow, act, think, and see. After eligibility has been&#xD;
      confirmed, the participant's eyes will be assigned as the treated eye and the control fellow&#xD;
      eye. Due to the symmetry in the clinical course of CLN2 ocular disease, untreated fellow eyes&#xD;
      will serve as controls for the contralateral, treated eyes.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A participant is eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria&#xD;
        apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has biallelic CLN2 mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has decreased leukocyte TPP1 activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has clinical signs or symptoms consistent with CLN2 disease (eg, developmental delay,&#xD;
             developmental decline, seizure, vision loss, or other signs/symptoms) OR an older&#xD;
             sibling with confirmed CLN2 diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is currently receiving biweekly ICV ERT treatment with cerliponase alfa.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meets baseline disease condition according to age, retinal thickness, and visual&#xD;
             acuity criteria ( varies by treatment arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             prevent administration and evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation&#xD;
             of participant safety or study results (eg, significant lens or corneal opacities,&#xD;
             glaucoma, amblyopia, gross retinal anatomical abnormality, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior participation in a gene therapy study&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior intraocular injections of any kind, except an intravitreal cerliponase alfa&#xD;
             trial where a subject has received a maximum of 3 injections&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a clinical study with an investigational drug in the past six months&#xD;
             prior to screening, except for intracerebroventricular cerliponase alfa.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ocular surgery within the prior six months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any other condition that would not allow the potential participant to complete&#xD;
             follow-up examinations during the study or, in the opinion of the investigator, makes&#xD;
             the potential participant unsuitable for the study&#xD;
