  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is reported that compared to chemotherapy alone, immunochemotherapy has significantly&#xD;
      improved the overall survival of patients with advanced metastatic ESCC. However, there are&#xD;
      still more than 30% of patients who cannot benefit from this treatment modality. In addition&#xD;
      to these factors, the time-of-day infusion and administration sequence of immunochemotherapy&#xD;
      have been reported to be associated with tumor responses and overall survival. In this study,&#xD;
      The investigators aimed to explore the roles of infusion time and administration sequence of&#xD;
      immunochemotherapy in predicting tumor responses and overall survival in patients with&#xD;
      advanced ESCC.&#xD;
