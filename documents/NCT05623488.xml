  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study to establish the safety and feasibility of lentiviral transduced CAR&#xD;
      T cell products in patients with mesothelin expressing breast cancer. This study will be&#xD;
      initiated as a single cohort (described below), however the adaptive design will allow for&#xD;
      additional disease indications and other investigational CAR T cell products to be explored&#xD;
      as separate cohorts under this protocol in the future.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic triple-negative breast&#xD;
             cancer as confirmed by all of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ER-negative or low-ER positive (≤ 10% by IHC)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. PR-negative or low-PR positive (≤ 10% by IHC)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. HER2 negative by IHC/FISH&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with an accessible lesion that can be targeted for both intratumoral&#xD;
             injection and surgical excision/biopsy by either a surgeon or interventional&#xD;
             radiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Confirmed tumor mesothelin expression by ≥ 10% of malignant cells by IHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. ALT/AST ≤ 3 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Must have a minimum level of pulmonary reserve defined as ≤ Grade 1 dyspnea and&#xD;
                  pulse oxygen &gt; 92% on room air&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction (LVEF) ≥ 45% confirmed by echocardiogram&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Active invasive cancer other than the study-targeted malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Evidence of active hepatitis B or hepatitis C. The following would not qualify as an&#xD;
             active infection, thus would not exclude the subject from participating:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Positive HBV serology with undetectable viral load and ongoing antiviral&#xD;
                  prophylaxis for potential HBV reactivation.&#xD;

               2. Positive HCV serology with quantitative PCR for plasma HCV RNA below the lower&#xD;
                  limit of detection, with or without concurrent antiviral HCV treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with ongoing or active infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppressive treatment equivalent to&#xD;
             ≥ 10 mg/day of prednisone. Patients with autoimmune neurologic diseases (such as MS)&#xD;
             will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Planned concurrent treatment with systemic high dose corticosteroids. Patients may be&#xD;
             on a stable low dose of steroids (≤ 10mg daily equivalent of prednisone). Use of&#xD;
             inhaled or topical steroids is allowable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum&#xD;

             according to the New York Heart Association Classification or other cardiovascular&#xD;
             condition that would preclude assessment of mesothelin induced pericarditis or that&#xD;
             may worsen as a result of toxicities expected for this study. This determination will&#xD;
             be made by a cardiologist if cardiac issues are suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with significant lung disease as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients with radiographic evidence of greater than lobar lymphangitic pulmonary&#xD;
                  involvement, greater than lobar bronchial wall thickening suggestive of&#xD;

                  parenchymal metastatic burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients with radiographic and/or clinical evidence of active radiation&#xD;
                  pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Patients with radiographic evidence of underlying interstitial lung disease,&#xD;
                  including evidence of unresolved drug toxicity from any agent (e.g. chemotherapy,&#xD;
                  targeted agents, amiodarone, nitrofurantoin, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Screening for this&#xD;
             (e.g. lumbar puncture, brain MRI, etc) is not required unless the patient is&#xD;
             symptomatic and/or radiographic findings are present.&#xD;
