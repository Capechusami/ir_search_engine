    <textblock>
      This is an 18 to 54 week study assessing the efficacy of Full-Spectrum Medicinal Cannabis&#xD;
      Plant Extract 0.08% THC (NTI164) on the severity of autism spectrum disorder in young people.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of NTI164 in patients with ASD&#xD;
      when treated with 20mg/kg/day for 8 - 54 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprises of an 8-week double-blinded randomised controlled treatment period&#xD;
      followed by an 8-week open-label maintenance period followed by a 2-week wash-out period.&#xD;
      Participants who wish to continue receiving the study treatment beyond the 16 week period may&#xD;
      do so for up to fifty-two weeks (Extension phase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be measured and monitored by performing participant- and psychologist- led&#xD;
      questionnaires specific to measuring changes in the behaviour of patients with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be measured and monitored by performing full blood examinations and liver and&#xD;
      renal function tests throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional assessments include microbiome and inflammatory marker assessments.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>At the beginning of the study, participants will be randomised into either the active group or placebo group. Both groups will commence a double-blinded baseline dose of either 5mg/kg/day of NTI164 or Placebo that will be increased weekly by 5mg/kg for a period of 4 weeks until the maximum tolerated dose or 20/mg/kg/day is achieved.&#xD;
At the end of the 8-week period, both study groups will be unblinded and all participants will begin or continue NTI164 for 8 weeks.</intervention_model_description>
