  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in China. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic similarity of Tafolecimab with different manufacturing process in healthy&#xD;
      male subjects. Another purpose is to determine safety, and immunogenicity of sintilimab with&#xD;
      different manufacturing process,also to determine Pharmacodynamics of Tafolecimab with&#xD;
      different manufacturing process&#xD;
