  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. This trial is used&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy of soothing cream jel on chronic upper limb pain and the range of&#xD;
      motion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects will be screened according to the eligibility criteria after signing the&#xD;
      informed consent form. Subjects who fulfill the requirements will be randomized into either&#xD;
      the treatment group or the placebo group. And receive either soothing cream jel or placebo&#xD;
      cream jel for 2 weeks. Then followed by a post-treatment for 2 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Change of the range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The range of motion of upper (shoulder or elbow) will be measured by a digital goniometer.&#xD;
For the shoulder, active flexion and abduction ROMs are measured using a goniometer while the participants are standing. For the elbow, both flexion and extension will be measured by a goniometer in a standing position.</description>

    <measure>Change of Numeric pain rating scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It contains 11 items in which subjects select a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the average intensity of subjects' pain in the past week. The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme (e.g. &quot;no pain&quot;) to '10' representing the other pain extreme (e.g. &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; or &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;)</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Handgrip strengths are measured by a dynamometer, on the dominant hand of the participant. Participants are instructed to hold the device with the arm at the right angle and elbow to the side of the body. The maximum effort will be taken from three attempts.</description>

    <measure>Score change of American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASESp-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ASESp-S consists of 18 questions from 3 sections: pain, instability and activities of daily living (ADL). Among the 18 questions, 11 self-report items represented functional ADL dimension (10 items) and pain dimension (1 item). The ADL section was scored on a 4-points-graded ordinal scale, ranging from 0 (unable to do) to 3 (not difficult) and cumulative scores were collected. The pain section was derived from the 10-points-graded visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain).</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ASESp-E consists of 3 sections: pain, function, and satisfaction. Patients are asked about the spot of pain in their elbow and asked to rate pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) in different situations, such as the worst of pain, at rest, lifting a heavy object, doing a task with repeated elbow movements and at night. The VAS ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (maximum pain). In the function section, patients are asked to rate their ability to perform 10 ADL and their usual work and sporting activities with the scale from 0 (unable to do) to 3 (not difficult).</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SF36 is a generic instrument to measure general health status. It will be used to assess the patient's health status using 8 different dimensions including vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional health, social role functioning and mental health. The possible score ranges from 0 to 100 points whereby 0 points represent the greatest possible limitation of health, while 100 points represent the absence of health restrictions.</description>
