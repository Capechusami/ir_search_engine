      Background Since fatigue seems related to poorer physical fitness rather than to gender, we&#xD;
      analyzed the physiological responses during a 30 minutes sustained CPR sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and results Handgrip strength and VO2 max determined strength and endurance.&#xD;
      Twenty-three medicine (M) and 27 physical education (PE) female students performed 30 minutes&#xD;
      CPR. Compression quality and ECG were continuously monitored, heartrate and non-invasive&#xD;
      blood pressure (NIBP) every 2 minutes. Capillary pH, PcCO2, lactate, potassium and sodium&#xD;
      bicarbonate were analyzed every 10 minutes.&#xD;

      2.1. Data collection Fifty female students who completed a CPR course in accordance with the&#xD;
      2010 ERC Guidelines were recruited on a voluntary base at the faculty of Medicine and Health&#xD;
      Sciences (Ghent University, Belgium). Given the reports of several authors that the physical&#xD;
      characteristics of the rescuers (including gender) had no impact on their CPR performance, we&#xD;
      did not use a male control group. This prospective data collection was carried out at Ghent&#xD;
      University Hospital and approved by the research Ethics Committee (B670201112158) and&#xD;
      informed consent was obtained from every participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Study protocol The participants were divided into two groups according to their expected&#xD;
      physical condition: Medicine students (M; n=23) and Physical Education students (PE; n=27).&#xD;
      As a consequence of their curriculum we expected the physical education students to have a&#xD;
      good or at least better physical condition compared to the medical students. The&#xD;
      participants' height (anthropometer GPM, DKSH Switzerland), weight (electronic SECA, 815&#xD;
      Elegantia) and body fat percentage (Harpende Skinfold Calliper, Fysio Supplies) were&#xD;
      measured. Body mass index (BMI; kg/mÂ²) was calculated. To assess baseline strength and&#xD;
      endurance respectively, we measured hand grip strength (kg) (Hydraulic hand dynamometer,&#xD;
      Sachon corporation, Mason) as a determinant of general muscle strength and we estimated&#xD;
      maximal oxygen uptake (ml/kg/min) by means of an endurance shuttle run test as a parameter of&#xD;
      maximal aerobic power.In order to detect unknown cardiac abnormalities a 12 lead ECG (Delta&#xD;
      60 plus, Cardioline) was performed in all volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were considered as lay rescuers and had received previous CPR training.&#xD;
      However, to avoid any pre-testing difference, each group received a CPR instruction booster,&#xD;
      using the ERC-accredited 4-stage approach, one week before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this, the students were asked to perform a 30 minutes sustained CPR sequence (30:2).&#xD;
      Regarding the available evidence on the impact of CPR feedback devices on CPR quality,&#xD;
      participants were given real-time feedback on hand positioning, compression depth,&#xD;
      ventilation volume and a metronome continuously provided a rhythm of 100-120 compressions per&#xD;
      minute.(5) CPR quality data were registered using a Laerdal Resusci Anne manikin (Laerdal,&#xD;
      Norway) connected to a Laerdal PC Skill reporting software (version 2.4) and simultaneously&#xD;
      monitored by an observer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define compressions as adequate, they were automatically evaluated for depth (&gt;5 cm),&#xD;
      frequency (100-120/min) and complete release (&lt;0.5 cm). The ventilations were automatically&#xD;
      evaluated for the inflated volume (400-1000 ml). The 30:2 CPR was performed during 30 minutes&#xD;
      with a hands-off period every 2 minutes during the AED analysis. This time interval was used&#xD;
      to measure and register the volunteers heart rate (bpm), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP)&#xD;
      and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), which was repeated every 2 minutes. All participants&#xD;
      were connected to a continuous 5 lead ECG monitor (SC 9000 xl, Siemens). In addition to the&#xD;
      non invasive monitoring, capillary blood samples from the fingertip were taken every 10&#xD;
      minutes to analyze the pH, PcCO2, lactate, potassium and sodium bicarbonate (Radiometer ABL90&#xD;
      Flex, Denmark). The results of the non-invasive and capillary monitoring were evaluated by an&#xD;
      anaesthesiologist and exercise physiologist throughout the whole exercise. In case of&#xD;
      hypertension or arrhythmia, tiredness, feeling unwell or failure to maintain correct&#xD;
      compression rhythm or depth the participant was asked to stop the physical effort and the&#xD;
      reason was noted. At the end of the 30 minutes the participants were asked to appraise their&#xD;
      feeling of exertion on a &quot;Borg rating of perceived exertion scale&quot; ranging from 6 to 20.&#xD;
