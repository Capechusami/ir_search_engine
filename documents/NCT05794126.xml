      The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term clinical performance of a soft&#xD;
      multifocal hydrogel contact lens when compared to soft silicone multifocal hydrogel lens&#xD;
      after 15 minutes of daily wear each.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are at least 42 years of age and have capacity to volunteer.&#xD;

             Statement of Informed Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have had a full eye examination within past two years (by self-report)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are willing and able to follow protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They habitually use vision correction for near vision (multifocal soft contact lenses,&#xD;
             sphere lenses for monovision, sphere lenses for distance vision correction and&#xD;
             spectacles for near vision correction, or have a different spectacle prescription for&#xD;
             distance and near vision correction) and have done so for at least the past three&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have refractive astigmatism of no greater than -0.75DC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are expected to be able to fitted with the study lenses within power range&#xD;
             available, and to achieve binocular distance HCVA of +0.20 or better in the study&#xD;
             lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have an ocular disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have a systemic disorder which would normally contra-indicate contact lens wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are using any topical medication such as eye drops or ointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are aphakic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have had corneal refractive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid lens wear or&#xD;
             have keratoconus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have an eye or health condition including an immunosuppressive or infectious&#xD;
             disease which would, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicate contact lens&#xD;
             wear or pose risk to study personnel; or a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic&#xD;
             reaction.&#xD;
