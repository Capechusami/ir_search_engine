    <measure>The overall responder rate in the study eye at Week 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week12/Week24</time_frame>
    <description>Responder rate were defined as participants with a reduction in clinical activity score (CAS, see Secondary Outcome Measure 2 description for details) of ≥ 2 points, and a reduction in proptosis of ≥ 2 mm in the study eye, and no deterioration (increase in CAS of ≥ 2 points or increase in proptosis of ≥ 2 mm) in the non-study eye.)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of subjects with a CAS value of 0 or 1 in the study eye at Week 12 and 24. Mean Change of the CAS value in the study eye from Baseline to Week 12 and Week 24.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week12/Week24</time_frame>
    <description>According to the 7-item European Group on Graves' Ophthalmopathy (EUGOGO) amendment, CAS was used to evaluate clinical activity. For each of the following items, one point is given:&#xD;
spontaneous orbital pain, gaze evoked orbital pain, eyelid swelling that is considered to be due to active (inflammatory phase) Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO), eyelid erythema, conjunctival redness that is considered to be due to active (inflammatory phase) GO, chemosis, and inflammation of caruncle or plica. The sum of these points is the total score, with 0 indicating no clinical activity and 7 indicating the most severe clinical activity.</description>
