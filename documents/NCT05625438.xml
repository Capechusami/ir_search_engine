    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the safety and feasibility of providing extra&#xD;
      doses of rehabilitation therapy for persons with a recent stroke. The therapy treatment&#xD;
      targets to improve arm function by introducing telerehabilitation to the bedside of&#xD;
      participants during the inpatient rehab admission period. Participants will use a newly&#xD;
      developed functional training system (HandyMotion) to access therapy treatment program&#xD;
      directly from their hospital room. HandyMotion is a sensor-based training system that can&#xD;
      connect to the TV set in the hospital room, enabling patients to access their therapy&#xD;
      training program to practice rehab-oriented games and exercises ad libitum, at any time of&#xD;
      the day.&#xD;

      This clinical trial is designed to address 3 specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To measure the safety of daily bedside telerehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To measure the feasibility of daily bedside telerehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To derive a preliminary estimate of motor and functional outcomes in patients engaged&#xD;
      in daily bedside telerehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telerehabilitation therapy is delivered over the course of the inpatient rehabilitation stay.&#xD;
      A therapist-facing web portal is used for treatment planning and patient monitoring. The&#xD;
      treatment approach was initially designed based on an upper-extremity task-specific training&#xD;
      manual and Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each daily 45-minute treatment session is created by a licensed OT or PT and includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. At least 15 min/day of upper extremity exercises. In addition, therapists have the option&#xD;
      to incorporate standard exercise equipment (e.g., Theraband or dowels) that can be&#xD;
      incorporated into assigned exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. At least 15 min/day of functional training through games. The study provides 2 controllers&#xD;
      with 5 different input devices that are available to drive game play. Games stress various&#xD;
      motor control features (e.g., varying movement speed, range of motion, target size, extent of&#xD;
      visuomotor tracking, or level of cognitive demand), which are selected and adjusted by the&#xD;
      therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Five minutes/day of stroke education. The education content targets five categories&#xD;
      (Stroke Risk Factors, Stroke Prevention, Effects of Stroke, Diet, and Exercise) and&#xD;
      corresponds to the Stroke Knowledge Exam.&#xD;

    <time_frame>&quot;For approximately 2 weeks, up until 2 days prior to discharge&quot;</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be measured in terms of adverse events (AEs) deemed related to use of the telerehabilitation system on a probable or definite basis.</description>

    <measure>Feasibility of daily bedside telerehabilitation based on measurement of patient compliance, as determined by reviewing electronic records of device usage</measure>
    <time_frame>&quot;baseline&quot; and &quot;immediately after end of treatment&quot;</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be measured in terms of patient compliance, specifically the fraction of days where a patient is assigned to do bedside telerehabilitation and initiates a treatment session. Any factors related to reduced compliance, including technical and medical factors, will be recorded.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 18 years or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Stroke that is radiologically verified, due to ischemia or to intracerebral&#xD;
             hemorrhage, and with time of stroke onset &lt;30 days prior to enrollment; or traumatic&#xD;
             brain injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Unilateral arm motor deficits that are neither trivial (no arm weakness) or&#xD;
             devastating (arm plegia). This requires that the baseline Box &amp; Block Test score with&#xD;
             affected arm to be at least 1 block in 60 seconds but no more than 90% of the number&#xD;
             of blocks with the good arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Possess enough arm movement to participate in therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Informed consent signed by the subject&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A major, active, coexistent neurological or psychiatric disease that would limit study&#xD;
             participation, e.g., advanced dementia&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Expectation that patient's cognitive status will likely interfere substantially with&#xD;
             playing assigned games or exercises&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Deficits in communication that interfere with reasonable study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Lacking visual acuity, with or without corrective lens, of 20/50 or better in at least&#xD;
             one eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject does not speak sufficient English to comply with study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
