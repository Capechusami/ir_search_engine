  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the early stage, two previous studies supported by the National Natural Science Foundation&#xD;
      of China revealed the biomechanical characteristics and neural feedback mechanism of lever&#xD;
      positioning manipulation on lumbar intervertebral disc. In order to further explore the&#xD;
      analgesic brain effect mechanism of lever positioning manipulation on lumbar disc herniation&#xD;
      (LDH), the pre experiments were conducted and the results showed that lever positioning&#xD;
      manipulation had significant specific brain network effect before and after the intervention&#xD;
      of LDH. In order to deeply research the key brain targets and central response mechanism&#xD;
      characteristics of analgesia, this study, with the dominant diseases of LDH as the object, is&#xD;
      divided into manipulation group, drug group and healthy subject group. Multimodal fMRI and&#xD;
      Mrs scanning imaging techniques are used to compare the low-frequency amplitude (mfalff) and&#xD;
      local consistency (ReHo) of each group, and analyze the local brain function connection&#xD;
      characteristics of the brain areas related to pain matrix as seed points. Then independent&#xD;
      component analysis (ICA) was used to explore the functional connection of the whole brain&#xD;
      network, and the signals of related metabolites glutamate (Glu) and 1-aminobutyric acid&#xD;
      (GABA) in the brain were detected, in order to clarify the network regulation of lever&#xD;
      positioning manipulation on the analgesic brain effect of LDH and the biochemical mechanism&#xD;
      of central nerve, so as to provide a modern biological basis for the clinical application of&#xD;
      lever positioning manipulation on LDH.&#xD;

    <description>The specific lever positioning manipulation is as follows: the patient lies prone at the mouth-open position with muscles relaxed, waist exposed, knees and hips bent, and ankle joints crossed. The practitioner uses the right elbow olecranon to point at the lumbar vertebrae, then hold the patient's two ankle joints in both hands to cause the lumbar vertebra to make hyperextension and flexion movements through the arms and pull the patient backward and upwards hard. When pulling upwards to the trigger point, the practitioner pulls wit lever quickly with a technique and then senses a clatter or looseness at the positioning point. When the practitioner pulls with lever manipulation, the patient is asked to exhale and then inhale at the end of the manipulation.</description>

    <description>Patients in the drug group were given ibuprofen tablets as an intervention. The drug was manufactured by Anhui Renhe Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. with the approval number (State Drug Quantifier H34020779). One ibuprofen 600 mg was administered every 6 hours as needed for pain.</description>
