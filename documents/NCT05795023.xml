    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study in a cohort of about 30 patients with Idiopathic Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease, who will be evaluated with a clinical assessment and an oculometric examination&#xD;
      during a time period with specific intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the correlation between oculometric measures and clinical&#xD;
      assessment over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational prospective cohort study, in a cohort of up to 30 patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic PD. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that oculometric measures are able to&#xD;
      detect patient deterioration faster than can be detected using the currently available&#xD;
      clinical assessment tools. In addition, to evaluate the correlation between oculometric&#xD;
      measures and Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease&#xD;
      Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) score over time ,in subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, and who provide a signed Informed Consent. All patients will be assessed using&#xD;
      MDS-UPDRS over a period of 9 months (4 assessments, at 0, 3, 6, 9 months). During this time&#xD;
      period, every subject who consents will undergo a NeuraLight session including oculometric&#xD;
      measurements and eye-tracking recordings using a novel software-based platform and an eye-&#xD;
      tracking system (Tobii, CE-marked class B approved device) (approx. 30 minutes). The&#xD;
      oculometric evaluation will occur during the first 3 months for every patient every 2 weeks&#xD;
      (+3 days), and then after 6 months and 9 months from enrollment (+3 days), (9 tests in&#xD;
      total). All assessments will be performed during a clinic visit unless authorized to be&#xD;
      conducted remotely. During the study, the sponsor will be blinded to the private details of&#xD;
      the subjects.&#xD;
