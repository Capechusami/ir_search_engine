  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ADG206 is an activatable prodrug form of a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the&#xD;
      immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subclass that specifically targets cluster of differentiation 137&#xD;
      (CD137) (also known as 4-1BB) as a co-stimulatory receptor agonist for the treatment of&#xD;
      advanced malignancies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a FIH, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, sequential dose escalation study to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of ADG206 in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced/metastatic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective of the study: To assess safety and tolerability at increasing dose levels&#xD;
      of ADG206 in subjects with advanced/metastatic solid tumors who have exhausted their&#xD;
      treatment alternatives.&#xD;
