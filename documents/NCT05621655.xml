      The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity, safety and immune persistence of&#xD;
      recombinant trivalent rotavirus subunit vaccine in healthy infants aged 6-12 weeks and&#xD;
      healthy toddlers aged 7-71 months.&#xD;

      This clinical trial is aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and immune persistence of&#xD;
      recombinant trivalent rotavirus subunit vaccine in Chinese healthy infants aged 6-12 weeks&#xD;
      and healthy toddlers aged 7-71 months.The subjects will be divided into 12 subgroups. Two&#xD;
      different immune regimens and two dose levels will be evaluated in each age group. Toddlers&#xD;
      aged 7-71 months will receive two intramuscular injections on Day 0 and 28 or three&#xD;
      intramuscular injections on Day 0, 28 and 56. Infants aged 6-12 weeks will receive three&#xD;
      intramuscular injections on Day 0, 28 and 56 or Day 0, 56 and 112. Two dose (mid dose and&#xD;
      high dose) will be included in each age group. To maintain blindness in the trial, in each&#xD;
      age group with fixed immune regimen, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive&#xD;
      mid dose vaccine, high dose vaccine, or placebo.&#xD;
