    <description>From all the patients meeting the inclusion criteria every third patients was randomly chosen and invited to participate in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from every participant. Thus 100 patients have agreed to participate. All fixed retainers (stainless steel braided rectangular wire) were bonded in both arches by the same experienced clinician, who subsequently made impression for thermally formed splints and delivered them on the day of debonding. The effect of each of the procedures was verified by two independent experienced clinicians. On the day of debonding, directly following retainer bonding, intraoral scans were performed (T0). The patients were invited for repeating the scans after 1 (T1), 3 (T2) and 6 months (T3). The displacements were assessed by superimposition of the scans. The patients were recommended to wear removable retainers 22h/day. They were instructed to immediately report a failure and to apply immediately to the office in case of failure.</description>

    <description>On the day of debonding, directly following retainer bonding, intraoral scans were performed (T0), using 3Shape Trios 4 (3Shape, Copenhagen, Denmark). The scans were repeated after a month. The patients were invited for repeating the scans after 1 (T1), 3 (T2) and 6 months (T3).</description>
