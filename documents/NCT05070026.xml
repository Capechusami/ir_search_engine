  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many recent studies have shown that surgical trauma will result in an immunosuppressive&#xD;
      state. Combined with the effect of surgical stress, it will often lead to metabolic changes,&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response, and other problems. The body resists and removes the harmful&#xD;
      factors through the inflammatory reaction. However, an excessive reaction will damage the&#xD;
      normal tissues and cells of the body. The smooth recovery of the body needs to balance the&#xD;
      degree of inflammatory reaction. Surgical patients will trigger different degrees of an&#xD;
      inflammatory response due to different degrees of physical trauma, which runs through the&#xD;
      process of postoperative recovery from the beginning of surgery and often prolongs the time&#xD;
      of postoperative recovery. Reducing the intraoperative and postoperative inflammatory&#xD;
      response of patients has always been the goal of surgeons, and a method is the reduction of&#xD;
      surgical trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The successful experience of the first single-port thoracoscopic wedge resection of the lung&#xD;
      in 2004 provided us with a new surgical idea. Subsequently, a large number of domestic and&#xD;
      international studies and case reports show that single-port thoracoscopic surgery is safe&#xD;
      and feasible in lobectomy and segmental resection. With the rapid development of single-port&#xD;
      thoracoscopic surgery in recent years, the scope of application and clinical efficacy of the&#xD;
      surgery are gradually becoming equivalent to the traditional three-port thoracoscopic&#xD;
      surgery, which can ensure the safety of the operation and complete tumor resection, and has&#xD;
      its own characteristics and advantages compared with the traditional three-port thoracoscopic&#xD;
      surgery. The reduction of incisions can significantly improve the postoperative pain and&#xD;
      recovery of patients and wound healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, single-port thoracoscopic surgery also has a subtle improvement in patients'&#xD;
      intraoperative and postoperative inflammatory response compared with traditional three-port&#xD;
      thoracoscopic surgery. In this study, we compared and analyzed the intraoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative inflammatory factor levels of single-port thoracoscopic surgery and three-port&#xD;
      thoracoscopic surgery in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Through the&#xD;
      comparison of the measured values, we further discussed the advantages of single-port&#xD;
      thoracoscopic surgery in reducing inflammatory response and its application and promotion&#xD;
      value in the treatment of patients with NSCLC compared with traditional three-port&#xD;
      thoracoscopic surgery.&#xD;
