    <textblock>
      Post-thoracotomy pain is a challenging clinical problem that may be associated with increased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical incision produces post-thoracotomy pain (PTP) via damage to the ribs and&#xD;
      intercostal nerves, inflammation of the chest wall, pleura or pulmonary parenchyma cutting,&#xD;
      and placement of the intercostal chest tube. Acute PTP inhibits the ability to breathe and&#xD;
      cough normally. Numerous analgesic techniques are used to relieve PTP, including systemic&#xD;
      opioids, regional techniques (such as paravertebral nerve blockade, intercostal nerve&#xD;
      blockade, intrapleural analgesia, and epidural opioids with or without local analgesia),&#xD;
      cryo-analgesia, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging research has shown that the novel erector spinae plane block (ESPB) can be employed&#xD;
      as a simple and safe alternative analgesic technique for acute post-surgical, post-traumatic,&#xD;
      and chronic neuropathic thoracic pain in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESPB was first reported in 2016 for ipsilateral thoracic analgesia. It was found to be a safe&#xD;
      and effective block that can be performed by an emergency physician in the emergency&#xD;
      department setting for addressing acute pain due to multiple rib fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrolaminar block (RLB) was first reported in 2006 as an alternative approach to PVB. RLB is&#xD;
      performed with US imaging or the landmark technique. The efficacy of continuous RLB has been&#xD;
      reported for breast cancer surgery .&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the efficacy of ESPB has been described in a greater number of clinical reports than&#xD;
      has RLB: a rib fracture, breast surgery, thoracoscopic surgery, lumbar spinal surgery, and&#xD;
      laparoscopic abdominal surgery. In contrast to RLB, most of the literature on ESPB reported&#xD;
      the use of the single-shot technique (80.2%). The local anesthetic was postulated to&#xD;
      infiltrate the ventral and dorsal rami of the spinal nerve. However, Ueshima et al. reported&#xD;
      that ESPB could not provide adequate analgesia of the anterior branch of the intercostal&#xD;
      nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of the study is that to the best of our knowledge each of ESPB and RLB has&#xD;
      limitations regarding sensory block and distribution so our hypothesis is combining both will&#xD;
      provide more solid block regarding sensory distribution, time interval of the block efficacy,&#xD;
      and postoperative morphine consumption in patients undergoing thoracic surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies evaluated the efficacy of ultrasound (US) guided erector spinae plane block on&#xD;
      post-thoracotomy analgesia, however for the best of our knowledge no one compared the effect&#xD;
      of ultrasound (US) guided retrolaminar block combined with erector spinae plane block and&#xD;
      ultrasound (US) guided erector spinae plane block alone in patients undergoing thoracic&#xD;
      surgeries.&#xD;
