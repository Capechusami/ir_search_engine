      To evaluate whether salicylic acid was superior to cryotherapy for plantar warts&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with plantar warts were randomized equally to receive salicylic acid or cryotherapy.&#xD;
      Cryotherapy is delivered by a technician up to a maximum of four treatments 3 weeks apart.&#xD;
      Thirty percent of salicylic acid is applied once daily by the patient (or parent) for a&#xD;
      maximum of 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were the cure rates at 12 weeks; secondary outcomes&#xD;
      included time to clearance of warts, patient satisfaction with the treatment and&#xD;
      treatment-related adverse effects.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with HPV1-induced plantar warts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total number of warts is â‰¤5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 12 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are currently participating in another trial for the treatment of plantar&#xD;
             warts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients had received two or more consecutive sessions of cryotherapy, with an&#xD;
             interval of no more than 4 weeks (The history of salicylic acid treatment was not&#xD;
             considered as criteria for exclusion because high concentration salicylic acid is not&#xD;
             commercially available in Chinese mainland).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients have taken immunosuppressant drugs (such as oral corticosteroids) during the&#xD;
             past three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients have impaired healing eg due to diabetes, vitamin A deficiency,&#xD;
             hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients have autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus,&#xD;
             dermatomyositis, scleroderma or other diseases).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are pregnant or ready for pregnancies or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients have cold intolerance (such as cold urticaria, cryoglobulinaemia, cold&#xD;
             agglutinin syndrome or Raynaud's syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients have local pain intolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients have local hypoesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are unable to tolerate salicylic acid or cryotherapy.&#xD;
