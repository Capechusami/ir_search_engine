  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of emergency room visits is high at the extremes of age, with patients aged 75 or&#xD;
      over accounting for 12% of emergency room visits, and the time they spend there is&#xD;
      significantly longer than that of younger patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nursing Home residents represent 14% of these emergency room visits and only 5% of them on&#xD;
      average are not hospitalised and return to their original Nursing Home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective study of patients aged 75 and over referred to the emergency department of&#xD;
      the Nancy Hospital by the Nursing Homes over a six-month period showed that nearly 30% of&#xD;
      patients aged 75 and over referred by their Nursing Home were rehospitalized during the&#xD;
      period studied, 1/3 for the same reason and 2/3 for other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention of an Advanced Practice Nurse (IPA) attached to geriatric practice, among&#xD;
      other things, as an interface between Nursing Home and the hospital therefore seems to have&#xD;
      its place in improving the care pathway for the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment by an Advanced geriatric Practice Nurse of residents of Nursing Home aged 75&#xD;
      and over in Grand Nancy area one week after a visit to the emergency room significantly&#xD;
      reduces the number of new visits to the emergency room by these residents over a follow-up&#xD;
      period of seven months, compared with residents of Nursing homes aged 75 and over (outside&#xD;
      Grand Nancy area) who do not benefit from an assessment by an Advanced Practice Nurse.&#xD;
