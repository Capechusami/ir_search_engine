  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational pilot study on pregnant women who are diagnosed to have&#xD;
      Bart's hydrops fetalis syndrome (BHFS) affected fetuses and opt for continuation of pregnancy&#xD;
      will be invited to consider undergoing in-utero hematopoietic stem cell transplantation under&#xD;
      a research protocol, aiming to determine whether in-utero hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT) for fetuses with confirmed BHFS at the time of in-utero transfusion&#xD;
      (IUT) of red blood cells could be feasible in Hong Kong. The participants will undergo bone&#xD;
      marrow or peripheral blood stem cells harvest and an IUT combined with maternal stem cells.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alpha thalassemia major or hemoglobin BHFS is thought to be incompatible of life. A&#xD;
      prevalence study conducted in Hong Kong showed 4.6% of the screened population are&#xD;
      heterozygous carriers of deletional type alpha thalassemia, who would have 25% risk of&#xD;
      conceiving fetuses with BHFS if both couple are carrier. Fetuses with BHFS often develop&#xD;
      severe anaemia in utero, feature with cardiomegaly, high peak systolic velocity in middle&#xD;
      cerebral artery (MCA PSV), thickened placenta, and eventually hydrops, which can lead to&#xD;
      intrauterine fetal demise or early neonatal death; while the mother may also be at risk of&#xD;
      maternal mirror syndrome which will cause significant morbidity and even mortality. As a&#xD;
      result, when the foetuses are diagnosed with BHFS, most couple will terminate the pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the advance of technology, if the couples are both known to be alpha thalassemia carrier&#xD;
      (alpha-alpha couples), they may consider pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. However, even&#xD;
      though preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disease (PGT-M) is a mature technique&#xD;
      over the decades, it is still technically challenging, requires assisted reproductive&#xD;
      technology even if the couple are fertile and relative costly. As a result, most of the&#xD;
      alpha-alpha couples still conceive naturally. Prenatal ultrasonic surveillance is usually&#xD;
      offered for the couples and prenatal diagnosis is required for genetic analysis to confirm&#xD;
      BHFS when there is ultrasound feature of fetal anaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators propose this pilot study to determine whether in-utero hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation for fetuses with confirmed alpha thalassemia major at the time of&#xD;
      IUT of red blood cells could be feasible in Hong Kong.&#xD;
