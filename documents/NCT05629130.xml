      This is a longitudinal, prospective study, which will include 30 subjects with hereditary&#xD;
      coagulopathies, with arthropathy, chronic synovitis resulting from hemarthrosis of the&#xD;
      elbows, knees and/or ankles followed up at the Centro de Hemofilia HCFMUSP, after approval by&#xD;
      the ethics and research committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will undergo imaging tests (X-rays and Magnetic Resonance of knee, elbow, or ankle),&#xD;
      physical, pain, quality of life and functional assessments (Hemophilia Joint Health Score,&#xD;
      Functional Independence Score in Hemophilia, Perimeter, Test Timed up and Go, 30 second sit&#xD;

Please note: &quot;Since 2009, EQ-5D has been available in three versions: the three-level EQ-5D-3L; the five-level EQ-5D-5L; and a 'youth' adaptation, EQ-5D-Y. Although the EQ is in recognition of the EuroQol group name, the D refers to dimensions, the L signifies level, and the Y stands for youth, the name of the instrument should not be spelled out in this manner as this is inaccurate. Therefore, EQ-5D is not an abbreviation and is the correct term to use when referring to the instrument in general.&quot; Brooks R, Boye KS, Slaap B. EQ-5D: a plea for accurate nomenclature.
